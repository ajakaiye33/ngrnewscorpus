          "title": "CSOs, SANs fault Buhari\u2019s warning against court summons after office",
          "text": "Senior Advocates of Nigeria, civil society organisations and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party have said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), should be ready to account for his actions when he leaves office next year.\n\nTheir views came as a response to the President\u2019s statement during his interview on Channels Television on Wednesday that anybody who asks him to come and give any evidence in any court when he leaves office would be in trouble because he already made sure all important issues are on record.\n\nAsked by his interviewers what comes to his mind about 2023 elections, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my problem.\u201d Asked further if he had no interest in who succeeds him, he said, \u201cNo, let him come whoever it is. All important things I made sure are on record.\n\n\u201cNobody should ask me to come and give any evidence in any court, otherwise, whoever it is would be in trouble because all important things are on record. I made sure about that. Important issues are all on record.\u201d\n\nBut in their separate reactions on Friday, some senior advocates of Nigeria including Mr Femi Falana, Mr Ifedayo Adedipe, Mr Mike Ozekhome and Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, said the constitution does not give immunity to former presidents, and so Buhari should be ready to be questioned when he leaves office.\n\nFalana said he believed Buhari was misquoted in that part of the interview, noting further that the orders that could not be enforced against him at the moment because of his immunity would be enforced when he leaves office. He stressed that the President would be called to account locally and internationally.\n\nMaking reference to a recent report by The Guardian titled, \u2018BPP kicks against award of ICTN contract to medical firm\u2019, Falana said while still in office enjoying immunity from prosecution Buhari was already being indicted by a Federal Government agency.\n\nThe Guardian report quoted the BPP as describing as \u201cembarrassing and illegal\u201d the alleged award of the contract for the International Cargo Tracking Note to a health care firm. According to the report, the BPP maintained that the award of the contract breached the Public Procurement Act 2007.\n\nFalana also made reference to several court judgments secured by an anti-corruption group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, against the Buhari regime.\n\nHe said, \u201cRight now, he (Buhari) is already being called upon to give account not to talk of after he leaves office. These orders are going to be enforced.\n\n\u201cMore accountability cases are likely to be filed between now and 2023 and thereafter. In view of the avalanche of petitions alleging extrajudicial killings by security forces, the Special Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is likely to open investigations that may implicate top officials of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cWhile he is still in power, even the BPP is indicting him. People have gone to court to say, \u2018You and (Rotimi) Amaechi can\u2019t award this contract.\u2019 Now he enjoys immunity; when he is out of office, he won\u2019t enjoy any immunity. So, he should be expecting to be called upon to give account. And if the records are there, he will have to come forward to present the records. Those records are not in the public domain.\n\n\u201cMany of the times you request for information under FOI (Freedom of Information Act), they won\u2019t reply. So, how can he say the records are there?\u201d\n\nFalana added that if nobody was in trouble \u201ceven now that he (Buhari) is in office enjoying immunity and has all the forces, instruments of oppression and intimidation and people are suing him, demanding accountability, when he is no longer in power, his immunity would have expired, so he could be called to account (for his actions) locally and internationally.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Adegboruwa told Saturday PUNCH that the President was already trying to blackmail his successor, noting that when occupants of the position of the President, Vice-President, Governor and Deputy Governor are automatically stripped of the immunity granted under section 308 of the constitution and they could be summoned by any court, according to the section 6 of the constitution.\n\nHe said,\u201d What the President has said is purely emotional blackmail and is using style to threaten his successor, which is unexpected of a President that claims to be fighting corruption. The person fighting corruption cannot himself be running away from investigation or probe because that would be inconsistent with the President\u2019s open declaration to be ahead in anti-corruption fight.\n\n\u201cThe immunity granted to him is limited while in office, and once he concludes his tenure he can be arrested, like every other citizen. There is no law that protects an ex-public officer from being summoned by the court to give evidence or account of their tenure.\n\nUnder section 6 of our constitution, the courts are given the right and power to exercise jurisdiction over any citizen, and once the President completes his tenure in 2023, he should be expecting that a lot of times, he would be summoned to account for his tenure; the railway project, Chinese loans, humongous amount spent on electricity and we are only getting darkness and a lot of things the President has to account for, so he should be ready. As a matter of fact, he should be ready.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa noted that in the countries Nigeria copied its democracy from, some presidents had had to waive their immunity to be probed. \u201cI think if the President has nothing to hide, he should be the first person to attend court if there is any matter that seeks to interrogate his tenure in office.\u201d\n\nAlso, Adedipe said Buhari could be compelled to appear before a law court after leaving office.\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to agree that he does not want to be held accountable, of course he can be compelled to appear in court after his tenure ends. He can be summoned, the law of evidence permits that, and the constitution does not extend the immunity to after office.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ozekhome said the statement made by the President showed a mindset of disdain for the rule of law and was unacceptable.\n\nHe added, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari loses his immunity enshrined in section 308 of the 1999 Constitution by May 29, 2023. He becomes an ordinary citizen liable to be subpoenaed to \u2018answer any questions\u2019 from any court of law. He can never run away from it. He said all important things are on record. It\u2019s all well and good. But where clarifications or evidence are required, he is subject to being invited like any other citizen to come with answers.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he is more obligated than other citizens because he is the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This kind of statement shows a mindset of disdain for the rule of law and due process. It is not acceptable at all. I humbly condemn it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 83-year-old senior advocate of Nigeria, Robert Clarke, said the President had the impetus to say such because no former Nigerian President had been questioned after leaving office.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a tricky situation. Normally if a President resigns or leaves office and does many things wrong, the succeeding government can call him to come and account for what he did while in office but because it has not happened maybe that is why the President is feeling that way.\n\n\u201cFor instance, he said a former President spent billions of naira on power and he asked the question where the electricity is now. We know the president he was referring to and today he hasn\u2019t called on him.\n\n\u201cAnother angle is that he is sure of himself that he has not stolen and he doesn\u2019t need to be called upon. But don\u2019t take it as the correct version of what can happen.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the fact that none of the ex-presidents had been invited to account for their actions, Adegboruwa said it was due to the conspiracy between the elite and the leaders. He said any president that has nothing to hide should be able to extend its probe to anybody.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe fact that no ex-president has been brought to book as is being done with Jacob Zuma in South Africa and in other places shows that there is a conspiracy between the elite and our leaders and there is no difference indeed between them.\n\n\u201cThey only use the political parties to pull the wool over the eyes of Nigerians and create seeming division, but when it comes to protecting themselves, looting and personal benefits, they rise up to protect themselves. That is the indication, not that there is any law that forbids any ex-president from being summoned.\n\n\u201cIt is to show that the people who succeed their predecessors are also in the same game and even probably worse, and so the fear is that if they do it to their predecessors, their successor would also do it to them. So, the fact that no sitting president has dared any ex-president means therefore that no president has been clean. Otherwise, if you have nothing to hide, you should be able to extend your probe to anybody, including ex-presidents.\u201d\n\nCSOs disagree with President\n\nSome civil society groups have also expressed reservations over the President\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Deputy Director, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, Kolawole Oluwadare, who cited section 308(1)(3) of the Constitution, explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) does not give immunity to any president or governor once of office. He noted that the probe and prosecution of former South African President, Jacob Zuma, after he left office should be a good example for Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cImmunity leads to impunity, which is antithetical to the fundamental principles of the rule of law. Accountability of political leaders whether during the period of office or when out of office is entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, international human rights and anti-corruption treaties to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe South African example shows that it is good practice for citizens to demand accountability from their leaders. In South Africa, a panel of inquiry chaired by senior judge Raymond Zondo was established in 2018 to examine allegations of high-level graft during Zuma\u2019s nine years in power from 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria cannot and should not be an exception. In 2023, the tenure of the President (Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)) and several state governors will come to an end. It will serve the rule of law and public interests for Nigerians to seek accountability for how these high-ranking public officers discharged their constitutional oaths of office.\u201d\n\nHe said further that all high-ranking public officials, including presidents and state governors, since 1999 should be ready, willing and available to account for the management of public resources during their administration. This, he said, would send a powerful message to incoming leaders that the public office is a public trust, and that rendering account is part and parcel of the job.\u201d\n\nOluwadare added, \u201cOne important legacy President Buhari can leave is to urgently propose a constitutional amendment for the removal of the immunity clause in the Nigerian Constitution, so that citizens can pursue cases touching on allegations of corruption against sitting presidents and governors.\u201d ,, \u201cThis is consistent entirely with the notions of the rule of law and the public trust.\u201d\n\nAlso, the convener, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, said the President would be held accountable after leaving office whether he likes it or not, adding that it was obvious the President was looking for a successor that would not probe his government.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat the President has done is in two folds. First, he does not want to show accountability and take responsibility. One thing we must tell the President is that he has said his own but we would hold him accountable for all of his deeds. They would either hunt or justify him.\u201d\n\nThe Coordinator of the Northern Alliance Movement, Yahuza Getso, also described the President\u2019s statement as shameful, saying it\u2019s a subtle warning to his successor not to probe him.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a subtle way of warning his successor against probing him. This is the same way he clamped down on those critical of his administration. It is obvious a lot is wrong in his administration.\n\n\u201cHe has not respected the rule of law, there is corruption going on under his watch and there is total failure in all the sectors. He would be held accountable for all these. He\u2019s the one Nigerians voted for. That subtle warning won\u2019t stand. It is a shameful statement.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Director, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, said accountability is a two-way thing and Nigerians have a right to demand accountability after Buhari leaves office.\n\nShe noted, \u201cThe people can hold him accountable; it\u2019s not a matter of choice. The President cannot bar the rule of law from taking its course after his exit. The best advice for him is to leave a legacy in the minds of the people that will be long-lasting; the time is now because not much time is left.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with one of our correspondents, the Director Media and Advocacy, The Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education, Armsfree Ajanaku, said, the President must understand that bequeathing a free, fair and credible general elections in 2023 is one achievement he must strive to record for posterity sake.\n\nAjanaku said this should be Buhari\u2019s primary focus and not avoiding accountability after office.\n\n\u201cOn whether he does not want to be accountable after office, it is not just about keeping records. Those who held office at his pleasure may claim that what they did was at the President\u2019s behest. If such instances come up, the President must be prepared to let the nation know the truth about what transpired. He can\u2019t just say he would stay aloof and offer no explanation should it be needed,\u201d Ajanaku added.\n\nThe President, Ecumenical Youths Association, Daboikiabo Warmate, also said the President could not avoid giving account of his stewardship after his tenure, adding that since he claims to be a man of integrity, he ought to welcome such a probe.\n\nWarmate added, \u201cWe will demand explanation on those things we have been silent about during his time as President. Buhari has only one option and that is to give Nigerians explanations for all his failed promises. Also, the President\u2019s admittance of his age affecting his performance is quite true, with what Nigerians are going through.\n\n\u201cThe question is, did Mr President not know that age is not on his side before offering himself for such gigantic responsibility? Nigerians need to learn from this. Mr President\u2019s response to the question about what comes to his mind about 2023 elections is quite unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for a successor from Mr President but an electoral process that will address the issue of voter apathy. It\u2019s a good thing that the President does not have interest in who succeeds him because of what Nigerians have experienced. When he leaves office, as always we will hear the truth about all the truth and lies told Nigerians during his tenure.\u201d\n\nBuhari never takes responsibility \u2013 PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has said it is not surprised by the President\u2019s plan not to take responsibility since he had revealed that as an old man, he works only between six to eight hours a day thereby leaving his job to others to do.\n\nThe party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cHis statement shows a man who does not like to take responsibility, whether on matters of security or economy, and he is never aware of anything. Even when people are dying, he says he is not aware. He is never aware. He works only six to eight hours a day and that is why the country is comatose.\n\n\u201cThe job of a President is 24/7 and that is why when his phone rings at 3am, he is expected to answer the call. But sadly for Nigeria, we have a President who works only for about six hours.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "APC govs meet Sunday, to insist on convention before presidential primary",
          "text": "\u2026says Buhari\u2019s warning instrumental in averting party split\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress will meet on Sunday, January 9, to decide a substantive date for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nThis is partly in response to the caution issued by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority, which aired on Thursday.\n\nIn the interview, Buhari warned that by dilly-dallying, the APC might be setting itself up for defeat by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, met with the President at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja, on Friday.\n\nSpeaking with State House Correspondents, Lalong noted that deliberations at the Sunday meeting would centre on picking a date for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nThis was a governor, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH on condition of anonymity on Friday. He said the APC governors would insist that the national convention holds before the presidential primary.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cSome people like OUK (Orji Uzor Kalu) are pushing for the conduct of the presidential primary before the convention. That is not possible. The caretaker committee chairman of the party, who is also a governor, needs to return to his state and pay attention to governance.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the caretaker committee is just for the members to oversee the party for just six months. Now, we are almost having them as alternative to the party\u2019s National Working Committee. That will not work. We want to put the convention behind us.\n\n\u201cLook at the PDP, they have held their convention and have moved on. We need not pay too much attention to distractions. The convention should hold so that we can face other issues in the party.\u201d\n\nLalong, on his part, described Buhari\u2019s caution as a wake-up call on the party to have a seamless convention to avoid disintegration.\n\nLalong said the APC governors had assured Buhari that the convention would hold in February.\n\nLalong said, \u201cI agree that all the times there are meetings, especially taking final decisions on the party; I\u2019m always part of it and part of it was also why I visited the President and the President still stands committed that there must be an immediate convention.\n\n\u201cYou know, when a convention is coming, there are fears here and there; some people will tell you it will work, some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday we will tell you when we\u2019re having the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to hold the convention in February and we are still working towards that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re working towards our convention in February.\u201d\n\nLalong explained that despite the concerns the President raised, the governors were determined to ensure that nothing stops the convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome parties have held their own \u2013 the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from holding their own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governors to please do more and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to put our party alive.\u201d\n\nLalong stressed that efforts were being made to lay all intra-party differences to rest.\n\nHe added, \u201cA political party is a collection of interests. The interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\n\n\u201cI just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for.\u201d\n\nOn whether the APC could influence the withdrawal of ongoing court cases against the convention, Lalong said, \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party. It\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve differences.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court cases before going for the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also ways to resolve court processes, even after convention.\n\n\u201cI had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for the convention.\u201d\n\nOn whether the APC can meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission, Lalong stated, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday, Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\u201d\n\nAggrieved members drag Buni to court, want convention stopped\n\nMeanwhile, the APC internal crisis over the convention may have worsened as some members have dragged the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee before the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe applicants are seeking an order of the court to restrain the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nAlready, the Progressives Governors Forum of the APC has scheduled a meeting for this weekend in Abuja at the Kebbi State Governors Lodge in Asokoro.\n\nThe chairman of PGF and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, said top on the agenda of the meeting was the national convention.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit dated January 4, 2022 are Suleiman Dimas Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Chairman of APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and the Independent National Electoral Commission were listed as the first to third defendants in the suit.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in their suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/3/2022, are praying the court to make an order stopping the convention on the grounds that APC state congresses have yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Peter Timothy Igbifa, the 8th President of Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide, who made this comment in a statement obtained by DAILY POST on Friday, wondered why the president remained adamant despite the persistent calls for inauguration of a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nDescribing the action as an anomaly, the group noted that the tenure for the NDDC sole administrator expired on December, 31, 2021 stressing, \u201csomething is certainly wrong somewhere as to who runs the country as president. The normal Buhari that the common Nigerian knows would have inaugurated the NDDC board at least as a new year gift to the Niger Delta people who gave him the good will of regional peace like no other.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the environmental damages the activities of Multinational Oil Companies have caused states in the Niger Delta region, the council expressed resolve to inaugurate environmental specialists to assess the level of damage on the environment and come up with strategic blueprint that would serve as a basis for their environmental advocacy ahead of the UN Assembly 2022.\n\nThe council further expressed plan to address the UN congress on the abandoned Niger Delta wetland, which is the third largest in the world stressing that, they would not relent in advocating and engaging other means to drive the wetland conservation until they receive the 5 billion dollars grant meant for the Niger Delta people.\n\nThe Ijaw Youths also said they would take deliberate legal actions both locally and internationally on oil multinationals operating in the region due to their detrimental ways of oil exploration and continuous gas flaring, noting that they would expose all Niger Deltans involved in any form of ground conspiracy against their united course even as they said they would tackle their enemies through the law.\n\nThe council also called for the completion of east west road especially the Bayelsa and Eleme Road axis adding that despite the 20billion and 7billion naira released to Niger Delta Ministry, the road remained uncompleted.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, the council said, they would monitor the implementation of the act to the later by demanding for statistical implementation data from every relevant agency and advised the LGAs and communities to be proactive and united in the setting up of the management team with the IOCs.\n\nThe council stated that as the conscience of Nigeria\u2019s economy, it shall take drastic but united steps to advocate freedom from their collective challenge of marginalization, constant degradation of environment, prevalent oppressions, blackmailing and undue suffering of the Niger Delta.\n\nWhile urging the youths to remain calm, the president of the council said he was committed to providing more opportunities and empowerment for them in the region.",

          "title": "Cross River communities where girls are used as collateral, turned into sex slaves",
          "text": "There is an odd practice among the Becheve tribe in Cross River State whereby girls, sometimes as young as four years old, are used as collateral for loans their parents obtained from more illustrious kinsmen. Unfortunately, the innocent girls are often turned into sex slaves in addition to performing other chores for which they are not paid. Some victims of the obnoxious practice narrated their ugly experiences to JUSTINA ASISHANA who has just returned from a visit to some of the affected communities.\n\nBEATRICE Okumo belongs to the category of females members of the Becheve tribe in Cross River State referred to as \u2018money wives\u2019. As a five-year-old girl about 30 years ago, her parents had used her as collateral for a sum they borrowed from their creditor who was then about 50 years old and was much older than Beatrice\u2019s father.\n\nBeatrice, who calls his parents\u2019 creditor Papa, says she is now about 35 years old now, though she looks a lot older, with fast-ageing skin and a resigned look.\n\nHer journey into slavery had begun when her mother was delivered of a baby but her father had no money to settle the hospital bill. Her parents had considered themselves lucky that they were able to obtain a badly-needed loan from Papa with which they paid the hospital bill and also bury her mother who, unfortunately, had died during the childbirth.\n\nNarrating the rapid, downward trajectory of her life\u2019s story in Pidgin English, Beatrice said: \u201cThe person I was given to as \u2018money wife\u2019 was very old. I do not know the exact year I was given as payment for the debt, but I was still a child. They said I was going to take care of a baby there.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWhen I was about 11 years old, Papa came to where I was sleeping and wanted to sleep with me, but I asked him whether he would be happy to see someone do that to me ifI were her daughter. He explained to me that my family had used me to obtain a loan from him. I tried to resist him, but he overpowered me and forced himself on me.\u201d\n\nBeatrice recalled that after the incident, sexual encounter between them became regular occurrence and she got pregnant at 12. She reiterated, however, that their sexual encounters were never consensual as Papa was always forcing himself on her.\n\nShe said: \u201cI resisted him each time he wanted to sleep with me, but he always forced himself on me. I ended up having six children for him but two of them died. He had three wives before he got me as collateral for my parents\u2019 debt. He treats me as if I am a piece of property, and I cannot return to my family because they had vowed to kill me if I returned home, since they have no money to secure my freedom.\u201d\n\nLike mother, like daughter\n\nBeatrice said in a bizarre twist of fate, Papa also resolved at a point to use the eldest of the girls she (Beatrice) had for him as collateral for a loan that was taken for treatment of the complications she developed while giving birth to one of her children.\n\nHowever, the 15-year-old girl at the centre of the bizarre arrangement ran away from home when she heard that she was going to be used as collateral. Not one to be deterred, Papa settled for Beatrice\u2019s younger 10-year-old daughter named Lovina.\n\nSeeing how the situation was unfolding, Beatrice fled with Lovina to look for a job in the city to enable her repay the loan taken by her parents.\n\nBeatrice said as she fought back tears: \u201cPapa obtained N70,000 loan and promised to use one of my daughters as collateral.\n\n\u201cMy first daughter was the one given out as collateral, but she ran away. Till now, I have not seen her.\n\n\u201cThey said since she was not available, Lovina should replace her. So, each time I look at Lovina, I cry. She is just 10 years old and does not know anything!\n\n\u201cWill she now become a money wife at this age? This is disturbing me badly and that is why I need help.\n\n\u201cI need money to pay the people because they say that if the child will not return, we should repay them.\n\n\u201cI had to leave home with my children so that they would not use any of them as collateral.\u201d\n\nSwearing on her resolve in raw Pidgin, Beatrice added: \u201cThe same suffer wey I suffer, naim my pikin go come suffer too? I no gree o. E better make I die dey look for the money to pay than make dem use my pikin as money wife!\u201d\n\nInnocent young girl as collateral for maternal uncle\u2019s debt\n\nNow 14, Jennifer Abega was used as collateral at age seven. The bank had seized her uncle\u2019s property after he defaulted on his loan. So, Jennifer\u2019s parents allowed her uncle to use her as collateral for another loan he obtained from a local lender, which he used to settle the bank.\n\nJennifer said: \u201cMy Uncle got a loan from the bank, and when he could not pay back, the bank came to clear his house.\n\n\u201cHe came and explained to my mother and urged her to give me to him, as he had seen someone who wanted to lend him money. The person wanted a girl as collateral.\n\n\u201cMy mother agreed and allowed him to take me away. They gave me to one old man in Amana. I wept profusely.\n\n\u201cMy uncle is very greedy. Even after he had collected the money from the man, he still came back and collected more money, goats, drinks and other things.\n\n\u201cI stayed there for three years and those three years were hell. Each time my father visited me, I asked him why he allowed his daughter to be sold like a goat.\n\n\u201cI was never happy there. They maltreated me.\n\n\u201cThe man had another woman who was also used as collateral and she had given birth. Whenever she cooked for the family, she would give everyone good food and soup but she would give me pepper to use as soup for my food.\n\n\u201cI was used as a slave. I worked on the farm and at home. I did everything in the house apart from cooking, and if I did not do it, I would be shouted at.\n\n\u201cI was lucky that all through the time that I was there, the man did not touch me. He had the other wife, so he focused on her.\u201d\n\nNarrating how she ran away from slavery when she was 10, Jennifer said her mother had paid her a visit and she followed her when she was returning.\n\nThe story did not end there though, as Jennifer\u2019s uncle resisted her attempt at freedom and told her mother to either return Jennifer to the creditor or repay his debt directly to the man.\n\nNarrating the impasse, Jennifer said: \u201cMy uncle told my mother that she was the one who would repay the loan because I was the one who failed in my obligation.\n\n\u201cHe said my parents should repay the man or force me to go back. However, I\u2019ve told everyone in my family that nothing will make me return there.\n\n\u201cEvery time I see my uncle, I feel like fighting him.\u201d\n\nJennifer is still facing the dilemma of her parents\u2019 inability to repay her uncle\u2019s N120,000 loan. Although she is currently in school, she has become the butt of jokes among her classmates who call her \u2018money wife\u2019.\n\nDebt bondage\n\nDebt bondage, also known as money marriage, is an age-long practice among the Becheve, a tribe in Cross River State that spreads around 17 villages/communities mostly on the border between Cross River State and neighbouring Cameroon Republic.\n\nThe communities include Ketele, Amana, Ogbakoko, Belinge, Ranch, Ikwette, Imale, Ekor, Kalumo, Yindive, Makambe, Apambu, Belegete, Kajinga, Mangbe, Mbutu and Agusor.\n\nIn these communities, money marriage or debt bondage is a custom by which a girl child is given out as collateral when parents or close family members obtain a loan from another family.\n\nA collaterised girl child is usually transferred to the creditor at very young age and, more often, she is a victim of child rape, forced labour and early pregnancy.\n\nExperts say debt bondage is another form of child slavery, child trafficking and child marriage.\n\nPoverty as contributor to debt bondage\n\nFor the majority of the females who spoke willingly to The Nation, poverty is responsible for the increasing rate of debt bondage in their communities. Poor families rely on the well-to-do to bail them out of urgent financial situations, offering their underage daughters as collateral.\n\nAnother factor that pushes debt bondage is non-availability of banks in the affected communities, coupled with cut-throat interest rates charged by banks that agree to give loans. So, instead of someone who needs financial assistance to take a loan from the bank, they resort to local lenders who usually accept female children as collateral.\n\nMost of the females who spoke to The Nation said that the bulk of their families\u2019 indebtedness was used to pay third-party hospital bills.\n\nTelma Ekwa, a \u2018money wife\u2019, said her father was almost going blind in his left eye and needed money for urgent medical treatment. So he obtained a loan for his treatment, using her as a collateral.\n\nHowever, Telma, who is from Ranch community, has so far refused to live with the creditor, despite insistence by the man and his family that the N160,000 loan should be repaid or Telma should be forced to relocate to the benefactor\u2019s house.\n\nTelma said: \u201cI was bonded when I was five years old. My father was very sick; he had an eye problem and there was no money to treat him.\n\n\u201cAfter taking the loan, they said I should wait in my father\u2019s house until I was mature.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about 10 years old, my parents said it was time for me to go but I refused.\n\n\u201cThe man is very old. He is older than my father. He has white beard all over his face.\u201d\n\n\u2018My three underage children at risk\u2019\n\nKareen Ksa is currently facing a huge dilemma as she contends with the possibility of losing her three children to her \u2018money husband\u2019 if she can\u2019t repay the N200,000 loan obtained by her dad.\n\nKareen ran away from her money husband\u2019s house after she met and fell in love with another man, David, and got pregnant for him. She and David have three children together, but David does not have the money to repay the loan collected by Kareen\u2019s dad, which would have served to secure her freedom.\n\nDavid became mentally ill two years ago, after which Kareen became the family\u2019s sole breadwinner. This did not deter her parents\u2019 creditor from asking her to either repay the loan, or give up her three children as collateral.\n\nShe said: \u201cI ran out of the place because I was maltreated due to my refusal to sleep with the man.\n\n\u201cThe day I left the place, I told them I wanted to go and see my mother, but I did not return.\n\n\u201cI later met David and we started to live together, but he did not have money to pay off my parents\u2019 debt.\n\n\u201cI gave birth to two children before he ran mad, and another one who is now three months old.\n\n\u201cI believe that my money husband is the one behind his madness.\n\n\u201cHe (Kareen\u2019s parents\u2019 creditor) has been asking that I pay the loan or give him my children.\n\n\u201cI am doing some menial jobs like planting, harvesting and peeling cassava for people, but it is difficult to raise N200,000, especially as I am the only one taking care of the children who are between three months and seven years old.\u201d\n\n\u2018Generational bondage\u2019\n\nThe Nation learnt that although collaterised females can have children with anyone other than their \u2018money husbands\u2019, the children they give birth to belong to the creditor families and can only be freed when the loan is defrayed.\n\nIt was learnt that sometimes, bonded females are encouraged to sleep around if their money husband is too old to have sex with them. Children born through such arrangements belong to the creditor family unless the bonded woman or her family succeeds in paying off the debt.\n\nKareen says her singular desire for now is to pay off the debt she was bonded for so that her three children would not be taken from her.\n\n\u201cI am always thinking of how to raise the money. I am afraid that he will come and snatch the children from me.\n\n\u201cI suspect that he is the one who made David mad. All I need now is the money. I need to raise the money,\u201d she said.\n\nYoung, bonded and widowed\n\nIn Becheve, it is not strange to see girls as young as 11 already widowed. However, even the death of a \u2018money husband\u2019 is not enough to liberate the \u2018money wife\u2019 because she is a property of the creditor\u2019s family.\n\nShe is either given to another family member or told to repay the loan in order to secure her freedom. In extreme cases, a money wife may be persuaded to go outside, get pregnant and bring the child which to the creditor\u2019s family.\n\nLike others around her, 14-year-old Tabitha Jones was used as collateral when she was seven years old. Her money husband died four years later when she was 11. However, she remains in bondage because the creditor family will not release her until her parents\u2019 debt might have been paid. She said she was often starved in the house and when the man died, the suffering became worse as she was maltreated more than before. She later ran away.\n\nTabitha said: \u201cThe man I was given to as a wife is dead. I stayed in the house for about five years but the man did not touch me because he was very old.\n\n\u201cI suffered in that house and every time, I just cried. I worked on the farm and did almost all the work in the house such as cleaning, sweeping and washing.\n\n\u201cEach time I complained of too much work, they said that my family should come and pay the loan so that I could return home.\n\n\u201cThe man is dead now and the family tried to force me to go and seek men outside, get pregnant and bring the children. But I did not agree, and because of that, they started starving me.\n\n\u201cI ran away, but they are disturbing my parents too much since I refused to go back to them.\u201d\n\nPerpetual Onimi is experiencing the same thing. Widowed at 17 and now 20 years old, she is still struggling to repay the N200,000 loan obtained by her family when she was five years old. The money was used to pay for her grandmother\u2019s medical treatment.\n\nPerpetual stayed with her parents\u2019 creditor because her family warned her against fleeing. She bore the suffering, but she did not allow the man, who she said was older than her uncle, to mate with her.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe man was very old. He is not someone I can love.\n\n\u201cThe first time he came to me and started touching me when I was about seven, I was afraid. I ran out of the room and reported him to his mother, who promised to intervene.\n\n\u201cHe tried several times when I was about eight or nine years old. However, by the time I grew up, he had become too old and could not do anything again. \u201cSeeing that he could not sleep with me anymore, he joined the others in maltreating me.\n\n\u201cHe even told me that even if he died, I would remain in the house until the loan was repaid.\u201d\n\nAfter her \u2018money husband\u2019s death, Perpetual ran away to her parents\u2019 house, saying she was too young to continue taking the insults and maltreatment. She noted that initially, her parents did not agree with her decision to leave, but she remained resolute and her family left her alone.\n\n\u201cFor three years now, my family and I have been trying to raise the money, but it is not easy to raise N200,000. We are doing all we can to return the money,\u201d she said.\n\nVictims adopt new strategies\n\nThese days, bonded girls are known to flee from their money husbands, after which they mount pressure on their parents to repay the debts. However, it was observed that some of the victims stayed with their parents\u2019 creditors until they might have had one or two children.\n\nPerpetual, Tabitha, Jennifer and Kareen, who all spoke with the reporter, are some of the girls who have succeeded in running away from their money husbands. However, their nightmares are not over as they face threats and pressure from the creditors on a daily basis.\n\nThey each expressed frustrations that despite the years of hard labour, the creditor families still demand the full payment of the loan, in addition to the gifts given to the families of the girls whenever they visited their bonded daughters.\n\n\u201cThey cheat us a lot. After we work for them for many years, they still come and say we should pay the full money if we do not want to return to the house [of bondage]. That means it is the man that wins all the way and we are the victims in this,\u201d Jennifer said.\n\n\u2018I want to be free\u2019\n\nThe victims say that they cannot become free or marry legally if the money collected by their families is not paid in full. They also say they become marked women in the communities as they are often called \u201csomebody\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\nThey lament that they become prey to young men who take advantage of their situation to sleep with them and refuse to make commitments.\n\n\u201cI want help so that I will be able to pay the man\u2019s family so that I can be redeemed and free. I want to be free to go to school, to work and get married as a free woman,\u201d Perpetual said.\n\n\u201cI cannot marry legally if I do not pay the money unless the person who wants to marry me makes a repayment. Payment will make me free. It will make me a free woman because now, it is as if I am in prison,\u201d Tabitha said.\n\n\u201cI am not free now. I am even scared of getting into another relationship because I suspect it was the man who made David mad and he can make another person mad if I go with the person.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to pay the money so that I will be free from all these troubles. I need help to raise the money to redeem myself so that I can be free,\u201d said Kareen.\n\nIgnorant of the law\n\nMoney marriage is prohibited under the Child\u2019s Right Act (2003) but none of the aforementioned victims is aware of this and the majority of them, especially those who had run away, are still faced with the dilemma of how to repay the debts they didn\u2019t obtain directly.\n\nChild\u2019s Right Act (2003) is the law that guarantees the rights of all children in Nigeria. \u2018Children,\u2019 as defined by Child\u2019s Right Act (2003), is any person under the age of 18.\n\nPart III Section 21 of the Child\u2019s Right Act states that, \u201cNo person under the age of 18 years is capable of a valid marriage and accordingly, a marriage so contracted is null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\u201d\n\nPart III Section 22 states that children are prohibited from being betrothed, as \u201cno parent, guardian or other person shall betroth a child to any person.\u201d\n\nAnyone who goes contrary to these sections, according to the Child\u2019s Right Act (2003) will be fined N500,000 or imprisoned for a term of five years or both.\n\nPastor to the rescue\n\nPastor Richards Akonam has rescued 110 bonded girls in the past five years and he has also empowered many of them.\n\nSpeaking with the reporter at his base in Ogoja, Cross River State, Pastor Akonam said:\n\n\u201cIn the past three months, we have redeemed and freed five girls. It was quite expensive, the lowest being N160,000 while the highest was N280,000.\n\n\u201cOne of the girls is legally married now. She was given out when she was four years old and when she wanted to move out, it was big trouble because the man requested for everything that the family of the victim collected from him.\n\n\u201cThe cost was overwhelming, but we were able to free her.\u201d\n\nAkonam described debt bondage or money marriage, as it is popularly called, as a modern kind of slavery which is driven by greed and has continued because of the increasing rate of poverty in the country. He noted that, for some people, it is a status symbol to have a money wife.\n\n\u201cWhile others point to cars and houses as signs of wealth, a wealthy Becheve man will likely point to the number of \u2018money wives\u2019 he has as his source of wealth,\u201d the pastor opined.\n\nRichards said that the debt bondage practice gives rise to sexual and gender-based violence, adding that apart from the trauma which the girls go through from extremely young age, it is another subtle way of introducing girls to prostitution.\n\n\u201cThis is because, at a very young age, they become sexually active, because as a money wife, you must reproduce.\n\n\u201cEven when the man is old and inactive, the family constrains the girl to find a sex partner, either within the home or outside.\n\n\u201cThey do not care to know who the baby\u2019s father is. To the family, giving birth to children, especially girls, is the return on their investment,\u201d Richards noted.\n\nHe said the practice is unacceptable, adding that he is among the people at the forefront of combating the scourge in the communities.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of girls are forced into debt bondage and they are ready to leave, but there is no money to redeem them. He decried government\u2019s refusal to enforce the Child\u2019s Right Act (2003) in communities where money marriage is rife.\n\n\u201cIt is totally unacceptable in today\u2019s world to withhold education from girls or to deny them their rights, buy or sell them into slavery.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways to help these girls, but funds are needed because the girls cannot be liberated without paying off the debts.\n\n\u201cGovernment seems to be doing nothing. We have had so many talks, but it amounts to nothing.\n\n\u201cEven with the passage of the Child\u2019s Right Act, not one arrest has been made or one person prosecuted. So the girls are still victims of this archaic practice,\u201d Richards said.\n\nHe said that the fear of death and other penalties tied to leaving keep some collaterised girls in the homes of their \u2018money husbands\u2019, adding that those who leave are still forced to pay the loans obtained by their families.\n\n\u201cIt is an unfortunate situation because if the victim decides to leave the creditor\u2019s house, all the labour she has put in and the act of sex she had engaged in with the man are not deductible from the loan. She and her family will still pay. So, in all this, the girl and her family are the losers,\u201d the pastor added.\n\nGender-based violence in Cross River\n\nThe Cross River State Government passed the Child\u2019s Right Act in 2009, domesticating the national Child\u2019s Right Act (2003). The law sets out the rights of every child to be free from physical, mental or emotional injury, abuse, neglect or maltreatment, including sexual exploitation and abuse; and provides a robust framework for the child protection system.\n\nHowever, the law seems to have failed to protect Becheve girls from this modern-day slavery.\n\nThe Director, Women Development at the Cross River State Ministry of Women Affairs, Nancy Nsor, in September 2021 said that gender-based violence (GBV) is assuming geometric increase in recent times, adding that in the first five months of 2021, there were 717 reported rape cases, which exclude other forms of violence and harmful practices the women and girls in the state face daily.\n\n\u201cGBV in Nigeria is almost accepted as a fact of life in some cultures that perceive women as the property of their husbands,\u201d Nsor said; while the 2018 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey noted that out of 100 women between the age of 15 and 49 in Nigeria\u2019s South-south, at least 46 have experienced physical violence by the age of 15.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund Reproductive Health (UNFPA) and Family Planning Analyst, Dr. Abayomi Afe, during an inter-school activism against sexual and gender-based violence in Calabar in December, said that Cross River State leads the chart on sexual and gender-based violence with 42 per cent in the South-South region.\n\nAfe said that Cross River has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the South-South region, noting that the state is very diverse in terms of cultural practices and money marriage a.k.a. debt bondage.\n\n\u201cIn Cross River, the statistics of gender-based violence is still on a very high side, although we are still using 2018 National Demographic Survey Statistics.\n\n\u201cOther studies have shown that within the period of the pandemic in 2020 and now, gender-based violence has really gone up,\u201d Afe said.\n\nMeanwhile, Becheve youths are trying to combat this scourge, as it was learnt that the people who still propagate the age-long custom are the elderly ones.\n\nA youth leader, Ondafe Lazarus, said that his sister was a victim of debt bondage and that the practice is still rampant but now done secretly.\n\nHe added that he and other youths have been trying to help victims and to prevent other girls from being bonded.\n\n\u201cWe, the youths, are talking to parents to stop using their daughters as collateral and we advise youths who have interest in these girls to pay the debt and marry them, so that they will stop living a life of slavery.\n\n\u201cWe do not like the idea of these small girls going in for money marriage. We need to do more sensitization,\u201d Lazarus said.\n\nNeed for intensive sensitization\n\nSome of the officials of women affairs ministry in the state refused to respond when they were asked for steps being taken by government against the practice.\n\nHowever, the Director, Women Development, Ministry of Women Affairs, Nancy Nsor, said that when the debt bondage issue was first brought up in the ministry, she was not yet in office.\n\nShe, however, said that the ministry intervenes by trying to sensitise the communities and the girls, adding that she does not have detailed information about some of the issues involved.\n\nNsor said that for now, there are organisations involved in fighting the scourge but observed the need to do more, both from the side of the government and NGOs.\n\nSpeaking about the Child Rights Act in the state, the director said that the Child Rights Act is being enforced, adding, however, that debt bondage and money marriage, being the custom of the people, had been difficult to break.\n\n\u201cIt is their custom and it has been very difficult to stop it. You have to do enough sensitization, which the state has been doing. There has been a lot of publicity in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Child Rights Act is on ground, but it is difficult to invoke it on these people because it is their custom.\n\n\u201cThe people, because they are in very remote villages, have not gotten enough sensitization to make them know that the custom is bad. There is the need for sensitization.\u201d\n\nNsor further said that many victims want to leave the bondage but they cannot because there is no money to redeem them.\n\n\u201cLack of money makes the practice to thrive,\u201d she lamented.\n\nCross River State Commissioner for Justice, Tanko Ashang, did not respond to the phone call or text message sent to him, asking him to say what his office is doing to prevent gender-based violence in Becheve communities.",
          "summary": "Unfortunately, the innocent girls are often turned into sex slaves in addition to performing other chores for which they are not paid.\nHe had three wives before he got me as collateral for my parents\u2019 debt.\nThey gave me to one old man in Amana.\n\u201cI later met David and we started to live together, but he did not have money to pay off my parents\u2019 debt.\nHowever, she remains in bondage because the creditor family will not release her until her parents\u2019 debt might have been paid.",

He also assured them of his support. He said the party\u2019s decision is as a result of the requests of members.\n\nAddressing members of the support group, Aliyu said, \u201cIn our zoning agreement, we have agreed to re-zone the North as requested by others but we have agreed written openly as a result of what has happened that any candidate from any part of the country can now contest this election.\u201d\n\nHe added that the group has done wonderfully well by going round nooks and crannies of the country to ensure that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar emerges as the party flag bearer and is elected President of Nigeria come 2023. The National Coordinator of the group, Dr. Victor Moses, thanked the former governor for his continued support for Atiku Abubakar even as 2023 approaches.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe PDP had recently zoned the position of its national chairman to the north-central, leading to the emergence of former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as the party\u2019s National Chairman last October.

          "text": "By Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu and Emma Elekwa, Onitsha\n\nSays he never wanted to be a priest\n\nIPOB: Stop harassing him, other clergies praying for Kanu\n\nControversial Catholic priest and founder of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, has said that he borrowed a total sum of N1.253 billion for charity purposes in the year that just ended.\n\nThe fiery cleric also said he resisted becoming a priest in his early life but was practically dragged \u201cby Heaven\u201d into priesthood at a time he was running away from it.\n\nHe, however, said since his ordination as a priest, he had been \u201ca magnet of souls\u201d; a development he said is an answer to his personal prayers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe cleric, who said he borrowed the said sum in two tranches of N850 million and N403 million, added that everything he does in the Adoration Ministry is tailored towards charity.\n\nThe foregoing remarks were contained in Mbaka\u2019s 2022 New Year message to the members of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nHe said: \u201cIt may interest you to know that in the beginning of this just concluded year, I borrowed N850 million. I also borrowed N403 million.\n\n\u201cThis was not part of the projects we are doing here. It was only for charity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we do here that is not tailored towards charity. We need more money to continue a lot of projects we have at hand.\n\n\u201cSo, when people talk about Mbaka this, Mbaka that, I don\u2019t understand that. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t know me.\n\n\u201cAll these people talking about Mbaka have never visited this Ministry to know what we do. If they come, they would see for themselves and stop the unnecessary criticism.\n\n\u201cI cannot be listening to someone who does not understand me.\u201d\n\nHe told his members to be vigilant and not to be bothered by the threat to shut down the ministry, saying \u201cno human being can close this ministry.\n\n\u201cBut it is important to tell them that there\u2019s a division of labour. If you are a goalkeeper, allow me the player to play the ball. You can\u2019t be a goal keeper and a striker at the same time.\n\n\u201cThey should leave me. They are not my creator. It is God who created and called me; not them.\n\n\u201cThere are people who forced themselves into this priesthood and there are those called to be priests.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to be a priest. Heaven dragged me into this priesthood when I was running away from it. So, no mortal can force me out of it.\n\n\u201cAnd since I was ordained a priest, I have never experienced greater joy. I have been a happy man all through.\n\n\u201cWhatever one prays is what is granted him. My own prayer was that I shall be a magnet of souls. I only think about your goodness.\n\n\u201cWhoever is maltreating the masses is attacking me. So, whenever I fight for the masses, the story will be that Mbaka is playing politics.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not playing politics. Am I a member of APC, PDP or APGA?\u201d\n\nStop harassing Mbaka, other clergies praying for Kanu \u2014IPOB\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) yesterday warned the Nigerian government against harassing Rev. Father Mbaka and other clergymen and women praying for the protection of its detained leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe group, in a statement issued by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, also warned against humiliating or intimidating its leader and members, insisting that Kanu is not evil but a special gift from God.\n\nIt noted that prayers by clerics including Mbaka and the Reverend Father of Ebube Mmunso Ministry, Uke in Idemili, Anambra State had turned Nigeria and its leadership into confusion.\n\nIt stressed that people should not be harassed as a result of their religious views, insisting that Nigeria is not for any particular sect.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe wish to commend men and women of God who devoted their precious time and energy to praying for the protection of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU who has been incarcerated in the DSS custody in Abuja since June 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prayers of these men of God have turned Nigeria and its leadership into confusion since the beginning of this year 2022.\n\n\u201cWe realise that the Fulani-controlled federal government and its security agencies are confused as a result of the intense prayers of these men of God including Rev. Father Ejikeme Mbaka of Adoration Ministries Enugu; and Reverend father of Ebube Mmunso Ministry, Uke in Idemili LGA Anambra State.\n\n\u201cWe call other men and women of God Almighty who hear what God is saying to join others in telling government to stop humiliating and intimidating Mazi Nnamdi KANU and IPOB members, because Mazi Nnamdi KANU is not evil but a special gift from God Almighty, but unfortunately, Nigerians don\u2019t appreciate what they have.\n\n\u201cAgain, we are warming DSS to stop intimidating and humiliating men and women of God Almighty because they spoke about Mazi Nnamdi KANU. People should not be harassed because of their religious views. Nigeria is not for Fulani alone.\n\n\u201cPeople of God Almighty should rise up and talk in unison otherwise Fulani-controlled DSS will pick them one after the other to weaken them. They have started with Ejike Mbaka so others will fear and draw back from speaking the common truth about the goings-on in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe DSS and other security agencies can kill the messenger but cannot kill the message. The message which Mazi Nnamdi Kanu passed has gone deep into the minds of Nigerians and they understood the truth about Nigeria and its evil government.\n\n\u201cPeople of God Almighty Chukwu Okike Abiama would come out and defend their sheep because God Almighty Chukwu Okike Abiama handed them over to them as shepherd.\u201d",

          "text": "President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, has said restructuring is not a threat to the unity of Nigeria. Prof. Obiozor who spoke on Friday on Arise TV morning show, said that restructuring is a national blessing. \u201cRestructuring is not a threat to the national unity, it is a very dynamic thing in a dynamic institution of a nation state where as you grow, new things are developed and new ideology evolves. In fact every country that is wise and progressive takes restructuring into account as they grow. In case of Nigeria it will help to build a more perfect federation or union where conflict will be less and cooperation will be more.\u201d\n\nHe said if Nigerians had taken to 2014 National Conference, most problems faced by the country today would have been solved. \u201cIf we had taken time to look at restructuring, we should have actually taken more from the 2014 National Conference to lessen the conflicts that exist in this country, whether it is in our fiscal federalism, political or boundary issues particularly in revenue sharing. It is absolutely a problem federations solve very easily. Unfortunately all matters in Nigeria are over politicised.\u201d\n\nOn Nnamdi Kanu, he said that though President Muhammadu Buhari was right when he said that the case was in court, he however urged the president to apply his prerogative of mercy on the case. \u201cThe president said that the matter is in the court and you cannot fault that one. If he says he does not want to interfere in the function of the judiciary, there is division of labour at Federal level where judiciary is independent, so, he is technically right in thinking that the case is already on. We are asking for something different from the judiciary and we are asking for him to consider his prerogative of mercy which is his own prerogative.\n\n\u201cThe idea is treating him with mercy as a son and citizen, to be considerate and compassionate. We are not talking about the judiciary. If he is taking the judiciary route then he is taking the right route logically, but then away from what we are talking. We are appealing for mercy and some form of amnesty.\u201d He said that IPOB does not speak for Ndigbo and equally chided the Northerners who encourage their youths to make comments that incite.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cTake it from me and it is the right statement, IPOB doesn\u2019t speak for Igbo and that is the truth and to be very candid with you, the IPOB anger is an accumulated anger based on perceived or real injustice against Ndigbo for so long. We understand their anger and anger of many youths across the country, however the truth of the matter is that they are not mandated to speak for Ndigbo and the Northern groups that are making the statements is unfortunate because we don\u2019t respond when their youths in their youthful exuberant make certain comments like they did before that all Igbo must leave the North In fact the idea that some responsible people in the North can take position, it is predetermined.\n\nOn state police, Ebebuagu, he said the state police or formation of Ebubeagu or Amotekun is imperative in a federation like Nigeria. \u201cIf you want to be effective country, you have to look at how other countries succeeded not how they failed. The reality in Nigeria today is that Nigeria police is so small to police our country. You need not call it a state police. You can call it state guard or anything but train them to detect crime and reduce crime. As society gets sophiscated, crime will increase and nobody will say Nigeria is not developing no matter how slow you can see it.\u201d\n\nOn presidency, he said a President from Igboland and South East is an idea whose time has come. \u201cIt is politically justifiable and morally defenciable, it is indeed logical and in all sincerity, justice, equity and fairness have finally come home to Nigeria to crowd the Nigerian political history,\u201d he said.",

This is manifestly illegal and an abuse of the privilege of allowing civilians wear military uniforms during military training exercises.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to restate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria, as a professional institution, remains apolitical and, as such, would not want to be dragged into any form of political bias. Accordingly, it is important to advise politicians and others to desist from the use of military uniforms and accoutrements for political events and other engagements henceforth. Please note, anyone found culpable in this regard would be liable to prosecution.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, troops reportedly killed 1,910 criminal elements including terrorists, bandits, robbers and kidnappers across the country between May 20, 2021 and January 6, 2022.\n\nDHQ\u2019s acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Major General Bernard Onyeuko, at the biweekly update on Armed Forces of Nigeria operations across the country, yesterday, added that troops rescued 729 kidnap victims.

We will continue to sustain the offensive and will not relent until peace is restored to every troubled zone in Nigeria\u201d, he said.\n\nGiving the breakdown, he said troops of Operation Hadin Kai conducted series of activities in Operation HADIN KAI theatre which resulted in the neutralisation of 950 terrorists including their high-profile Commanders and Amirs.\n\nThe spokesperson said 79 terrorists were arrested and 113 kidnapped civilians were rescued by the troops of Operation HADIN KAI within the period.\n\nThe troops recovered 195 assorted arms including AK-47 rifles, GPMGs, PKT guns and locally fabricated guns from terrorists.\n\nAlso, 2,385 rounds of different calibres of ammunition and 253 rustled livestock were recovered, while a total of 14 gun trucks of the terrorists were destroyed in the course of the operations, while 16 gun trucks were captured by troops within the period.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Also, 75 kidnapped civilians were rescued, while 1,306 livestock, 108 assorted arms including AK-47 rifles and locally produced guns as well as 493 rounds of different calibres of ammunition among other items were recovered in the course of the operations.\n\nTroops of Operation WHIRL STROKE killed 168 criminal elements, while 127 of them, including migrant armed bandits were arrested and recovered 118 different types of arms and 381 different calibres of ammunition as well as 391 livestock while 33 kidnapped civilians were rescued.\n\nAlso, troops of Operation THUNDER STRIKE/WHIRL PUNCH theatre killed 44 and arrested 46 criminal elements.\n\nHe said the troops operations also led to the recovery of 59 assorted arms, 12 extra AK-47 rifles magazines, 113 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and 16 motorcycles among other items in the course of the operations.\n\nHe added that 14 kidnapped civilians were rescued and reunited with their families within the period under review.\n\nIn the war against economic sabotage, troops of Operation DELTA SAFE working in conjunction with other security agencies recorded remarkable results in their efforts against economic sabotage and other sundry crimes in the South-South zone.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, said political solution was inevitable in the matter between the Federal Government and leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nReacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent statement that the court should be left to handle Kanu\u2019s case without any interference, it said Igbo agitation was beyond the IPOB leader.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the the apex Igbo body, Alex Ogbonnia, disclosed that the South East Governors and other Igbo leaders would soon secure audience with the president and explain everything regarding their demand for political solution.\n\nHe said that Biafra agitation was part of the general gamut of marginalization of the Igbo.\n\nOgbonnia reasoned that an ordinary pronouncement by the President Buhari could end the whole agitation in the region.\n\n\u201cThere is a pronouncement that Buhari can make today, by then, many of us will now tell Nnamdi, the game is over and it will be easier to tell Nnamdi to drop his line of action. That is what we mean by political solution. But so long as this marginalisation continues, it will be ultimately difficult. So, this is what we call Igbo agitation, IPOB and some others.\n\n\u201cSo, political solution entails creation of Local Government Areas in Nigeria, revenue allocation, the number of representation of our people in the National Assembly and so on and so forth. All these things, we have to look at them. That is what we call political solution. By the time we begin to address some of these things, the issue of agitation will reduce. It will also attenuate the agitation and the issue of Nnamdi Kanu will be wittled because all of us will tell him. Assuming the President made a statement to say it is the turn of Igbo to produce the President, you\u2019ll see that there will be colouration, there will be a change, there will be a paradigm shift in the agitation. That is what we are looking at.\n\n\u201cWe are saying that by early this year, we will meet the President and explain to him more the approach we deem necessary for the release of Nnamdi Kanu. That approach is what we call political solution. We have not secured the date for the meeting but surely it will be because we had five committees which have all returned reports. So, we seek audience with the President and by the time he approves a date, it will be made public,\u201d Ogbonnia stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOhanaeze further expressed happiness that the president has responded to its call and that of other well-meaning Nigerians that bandits should be declared terrorists.\n\nIn a separate reaction, the Movement of the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) also condemned President Buhari\u2019s dismissal of a political solution for the release of Kanu.\n\nIts leader, Uchenna Madu, said it was unfortunate that the Nigerian leader gave \u201cpolitical, unguided and insensitive utterances\u201d on the the release of Kanu.\n\nHe said that no amount of frustration or intimidation from Buhari and Federal Government would end Biafra agitation.\n\nHe said the arrest, detention, dehumanisation and traumatic torture of Kanu, including the constant clampdown of Biafra agitators by security forces might seem for some a solution to a problem, but as former US President, Barack Obama said in his 2015 United Nations General Assembly speech, \u201ca government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength; it is showing weakness and it is showing fear.\u201d\n\nMadu said Biafra agitation groups were not the problem but a reaction to the many injustices, exclusion, second class citizenship, born to rule philosophy, marginalisation and other forms of inequality that characterise the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cBuhari in his inner sense of reasoning believes that with his kinsmen occupying the high military positions of service chiefs, including all the most senior military high ranks, he will easily crush Biafra. Maybe, with his intimidating tendencies over Igbo governors, National Assembly members, religious, opinion, political leaders, he still thinks he can crush Biafra.\n\n\u201cMASSOB views Buhari\u2019s constant negative comments on Biafra consciousness as a sign of jittery and unsteadiness. As every revolutionary struggle has its own methodology, the current Biafran struggle for actualisation and restoration will continue to unfold confusing methods to President Buhari. The spirit of Biafranism will continue to hunt Hausa Fulani people. Nigeria\u2019s days of existence are numbered.\u201d",

They spoke just as the party said it was set to deal with erring members found to be working against its interest.\n\nThe group, in a statement by its Secretary General, Tobias Ogbeh, said what Lukman had done was to practically provide reference materials for \u201ca contrived PDP win in the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find it most unfortunate that the DG decided to exploit the timing of our great party\u2019s national convention to ply his poisonous ware by pretending to make a legitimate intervention.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nSouth East leaders, including zonal and state executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), select political leaders and elders from across the fstates of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, yesterday, backed the presidential aspiration of Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nThey praised the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) for his courage and sense of patriotism in offering himself for the office of the president.\n\nThey said Anyim had, in the previous positions he held, distinguished himself as a detribalised statesman, consensus builder and true nationalist.\n\nThey stated these in their resolutions in Enugu, where Anyim briefed the zone on the outcomes of his consultations across the country so far.\n\nIn a communique by Chairman of the session, Theodore Orji, and Moderator, Eze Duruiheoma, the meeting appealed to PDP in the interest of equity, justice and harmonious national cohesion to zone its presidential ticket to the southern zones of the country and the South East in particular.\n\nThey said: \u201cWe take due cognisance of his precious record of distinguished and unblemished service as president of the Senate and SGF. We, therefore, unanimously endorse his aspiration with all conviction and enthusiasm and eagerly commend him to the rest of the nation as a worthy leader who will pilot the affairs of the nation towards greater security, unity and prosperity for all citizens.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of the foregoing, we hereby oblige Anyim his request that we all join him to persuade and reassure every part of the country to do justice to the South East and thereby promote equity and justice as core values of our nation.\n\n\u201cIn assuring Anyim of our support for his aspiration, we wish to also extend the same hand of support and solidarity to all qualified and deserving sons and daughters of our zone with similar aspiration and who reach out to us as Anyim has done.\n\n\u201cIt is our solemn appeal to all the peoples of the South East zone to remain steadfast in the hope that we can all join hands in solidarity with all other parts of the federation to build a prosperous nation founded on democracy, equity and inclusion to the benefit of this great nation.\u201d\n\nSecretary of Igbo Leaders of Thought (ILT), Elochukwu Amucheazi, said Igbo elders were proud of Anyim and would give him all the necessary backing.\n\nFormer PDP national vice chairman, South East, Ozichukwu Chukwu, praised Anyim for his courage, noting that he is immensely qualified for the job. He urged every Igbo person to support Anyim without reservation for now until other persons from the zone declared interest in the job, then, the Igbo will evaluate them and decide on a particular candidate.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe senator representing Ebonyi Central District, Obinna Ogba, said the state was proud to present Anyim, describing him as a good and marketable commodity that Nigerians would be happy to embrace.\n\n\u201cThis is the turn of the South East, we are not visitors, we are equal stakeholders in Nigeria. So, this issue of South East having the presidential slot is not negotiable,\u201d Ogba said.\n\nOn his part, PDP National Vice Chairman, South East, Ali Odefa, said Anyim has set the pace and urged others from the zone to follow suit.\n\nOdefa said: \u201cAs party people, we are supposed to be father to all, so, let us encourage our people to join the race but like Anyim said, Nigerians will decide. But must all know that ours is ours.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Anyim said the challenge before the PDP was how to deliver on the expectations of Nigerians to rebuild the nation; protect lives and property; restore the respect of Nigeria within the comity of nations; realign the political structure of Nigeria to reflect the current realities; revive the economy and save the naira; rebuild the broken down social fabric; create jobs for the youths and rehabilitate the collapsing educational systems.\n\nNoting that the above tasks were no mean ones, Anyim said it required one with the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the party to accomplish the tasks.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been privileged to understand our national problems and appreciate their enormity and peculiarities in the last 21 years from my vantage positions in both the legislative and the executive arms of government. Therefore, I have a clear view of the task ahead as well as the solutions needed to advance the cause of our country.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, with a sense of humility, that I step out as a Nigerian with patriotic fervour, considerable knowledge of our country \u2013 its diversities and current challenges; and so properly equipped with clarity of the needed solutions.\n\n\u201cFrom my consultations so far, I am glad to report that the responses have been overwhelmingly encouraging and inspiring. Above all, I am also happy to report that the mood of the nation favours the rotation of the presidency.\n\n\u201cLet me also, at this point, state clearly that I am aware that I am not the only aspirant from the South East seeking to run for the office of president. I encourage my brothers who so desire to please step out in their respective parties and after the primaries the nation shall choose among us according to their good judgment, after all, it is God who gives power. I, therefore, encourage you to give any other of our brothers and sisters opportunities as you have given me today.\u201d",

          "text": "*Says corrupt defectors will not be spared\n\n*Declares no leader would foist leadership on ruling party\n\n*Admits age has taken its toll on him\n\nDeji Elumoye and Wale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has warned the leadership of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), of what may happen if they fail to close ranks to project the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. Buhari said without unity of purpose among the leaders and other party members, APC might lose to the opposition.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday during an interview aired by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).\n\nBuhari also assured that those defecting from the opposition parties to APC, with corruption charges hanging over their heads, would have their day in the court of law.\n\nHe foreclosed the possibility of anyone in the party foisting leadership on members.\n\nThe president gave the warning to the leaders of his party while answering a question on the disagreement within the APC leadership, which was believed to be threatening the anticipated national convention of the party, earlier scheduled for this February.\n\nBuhari, who linked his withholding of assent to the recently passed Electoral Act Amendment Bill to the need to give people and political parties the power of choice to determine the system that suits them, also said the APC should be structured bottom-up.\n\nAccording to him, there is need for a system in the ruling party, where the people would be allowed to choose their preferred candidate from polling unit to ward, to council area, to the state, then to the national levels.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cWe have timeframe we have to work, because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then, the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off; they are still off, they can see it.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituencies they will know their positions. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after, Abuja. So, those who want to the elected at any level, let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody.\u201d\n\nCommenting on insinuations that politicians from the opposition with corruption cases had been defecting to the ruling party because of the belief that they would get immunity from prosecution, Buhari said no corrupt politician would go scot-free under his watch, even as members of his party.\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people, who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people to even be corrupt.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused, but luckily, I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels.\n\n\u201cBehave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarrelling, and a lot of noise\u201d.\n\nBuhari also addressed the security challenges facing the country. However, he expressed optimism that the situation could be resolved before he leaves office, pointing out that the security forces are working hard on it, just as more equipment and ammunition are being procured.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it, because members of the security, the armed forces and others, their own security depends on one Nigeria. So, no matter, when people are selfish, it is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the North-east and South-south and how much progress we have made.\u201d\n\nHe said the government had acquired some helicopters, aircraft, and armoured cars, and their ammunition to enhance security across the country.\n\nOn how age had affected his capacity as president, he said the pressure of office had been tremendous, but noted that he could not complain, because he asked to be elected into the office.\n\nHe observed that many of his colleagues were now enjoying their retirement, and hoped to emulate them in the next 17 months, when his tenure would end.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cI think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that needs to see you, can\u2019t see you. I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I, too, would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cAge is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week. So, really, it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d\n\nOn his readiness to hand over power, Buhari said, \u201cYes, because, look, as you know, I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as president. So, I have gone through the system and really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave, Nigerians will reflect and at least, show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best.

So, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now.\u201d\n\nRegarding the fight against corruption, the president urged the citizens to live within their means, saying there would always be challenges, when people try to cut corners.\n\nHe also said power generation was critical to the success of his administration, adding that the federal government is figuring how to better utilise solar panel as alternative means of generating power to conventional power, which is expensive and liable to sabotage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, told President Muhammadu Buhari to perish the thought of pushing forward a successor, saying Nigerians would firmly reject anyone from him and his All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 presidential election. The main opposition party berated Buhari for embarrassing his office and making a joke of himself by appearing confused and dwelling on false figures and bogus performance claims during his Channels Television interview on Wednesday.\n\nPDP made the assertions in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom commended the Buhari administration for heeding his call and finally labelling bandits terrorists, but said, \u201cThis is not enough.\u201d Ortom called on the president to be bold enough to go a step further and declare also as terrorists the widely known violent organisations among his Fulani ethnic group, like Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association ofNigeria (MACBAN), and Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), just as he had done to other groups.\n\nPDP said the president should have used the interview to show remorse and apologise to Nigerians for his serial misgovernance.\n\nPDP said, \u201cWhile we understand that lying is the standard gauge of performance of the APC, it is rather unfortunate that the president is also in that frame. It only reinforces the fact that nobody is immune to lying in the APC. Of course, he cannot extricate himself because lying is the official policy of his party, the APC.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Buhari, in his ludicrous attempt to rationalise his failures, falsely claimed that under the PDP, from 1999 to 2014, crude oil sold for an average of $100 per barrel but collapsed to $37 per barrel, when he and his APC assumed office.\n\n\u201cSuch false claim flies in the face of hard fact as the records, which the president must have, clearly show that when the PDP took office on May 29, 1999, crude oil sold at $16.27 per barrel and at about $80.42 and $63.28 by November and December 2014 respectively,\u201d Ologunagba stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cUnder President Buhari and the APC, oil price has never fallen as low as $16 per barrel as recorded under the PDP but started at $37 to $39.44 per barrel in 2016 and had continued to hover between $60 to $70 per barrel to date.\u201d\n\nPDP said it was on record that despite the low oil revenue, when the PDP took over, it expanded the economy, paid off the foreign debts, revamped the productive sectors, provided conducive investment environment, which encouraged massive foreign investments, and handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) to President Buhari and the APC in 2015.\n\n\u201cMr. President had no answers when, in the Channels TV interview, he was confronted with the facts that when he took over, the debt stock was N12 trillion but now N32 trillion and counting; that inflation, which was about nine per cent under the PDP is now over 15 per cent; that unemployment rate, which was about 8.9 per cent is now 33 per cent, that our naira, which exchanged about N197 to a dollar under the PDP is now over N500, and that the petrol price, which was N87 in 2015 is now N165 per litre under the APC watch.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should have seized the opportunity provided by Channels TV to show remorse, apologise to Nigerians for his monumental failure and national embarrassment that the APC government represents instead of trying to rationalise APC\u2019s failures with falsehood and grandstanding about a successor.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party explained that the mindset of the president, as exhibited in the Channels TV interview, confirmed the fears of Nigerians that APC did not believe in democratic practice and was determined to manipulate the 2023 election by all means. This, PDP stated, explained APC\u2019s desperation to scuttle the Electoral Act Amendment Bill provision for electronic transmission of election results, which will effectively truncate its plans to rig the 2023 election.\n\nPDP said Buhari and APC must know that Nigerians were fully rallied on the platform of PDP to face them in 2023 and the resort to underhand processes and false indices, like those reeled off by the president in the Channels interview, would not avail them.\n\nOrtom Wants Miyetti Allah, Fulani Movement Declared as Terrorist Groups\n\nThe Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, applauded the Buhari administration for heeding his appeal and finally declaring bandits terrorists. But ortom said the president must be bold enough to move a step further to also label some well known violent Fulani groups as terrorists.\n\nThe governor was reacting to the Buhari interview on Channels TV. Ortom said the step taken by the federal government would go a long way in containing the atrocities of the criminals and give innocent citizens the opportunity to go about their legitimate businesses unmolested.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cEven though the federal government\u2019s measures on bandits now seem strong, the security challenges will only be adequately addressed if similar hard position is taken on Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, MACBAN and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), who have vowed and continued to cause mayhem in Benue State and other parts of the country, because of the anti-grazing laws.\n\n\u201cFor us in Benue State, the law has come to stay. It is irrevocable. In fact, we have maintained our position that Benue State has no grazing routes, reserves or areas whatsoever. It was enacted in good faith for peace and order in the state. It was done, among other things, to end the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.\u201d\n\nOrtom also tasked the president to do everything necessary to revamp the ailing economy and save the citizens from poverty. He said, \u201cNigerians have absorbed enough hunger and misery in the hands of the All Progressives Congress (APC) misrule. Or is it possible that Mr. President is not aware that Nigerians are dying from his misrule?\u201d\n\nThe governor dismissed the president\u2019s classification of PDP as a failure, insisting, \u201cAs a critical stakeholder of the PDP, this is completely false. If anyone has failed, it is the Buhari-led APC federal government that has failed by taking Nigeria from top to bottom.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is ready to rescue Nigeria from the insecurity and economic horror placed on Nigerians by the APC.\u201d\n\nOrtom stressed that the party was better prepared with laudable programmes on the welfare of Nigerians and to rebuild the country from the APC tale of woes.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, the highest grossing nollywood movie in 2021 and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\n2022 predictions for the fintech industry\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Clubhouse-like platform\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2m fund\n\nWhat does 2022 hold for the fintech industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, Africa has seen rapid growth in the fintech industry. In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201cMy people perish for lack of knowledge\u201d says HOSEA.\n\nAs a journalist, writer and social scientist I have interacted with hundreds of politicians, public office seekers, academics, civil servants, clerics, critics and scores of other individuals in Edo State. My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

Everything needs to be done for us to move away from a situation where everything is imported,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to get to a stage where we bring our manufacturing industries back to life again.

We will do everything possible to reduce the rate of poverty in our country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele noted that if the country is able to diversify the economy, reduce unemployment and poverty, the level of insecurity in the country will reduce.\n\nAccording to him, the bank used had a lot to support the economy and would still do more to catalyse the economy for growth.\n\nHe said the banks would increase credit to the economy, explaining that there were companies that were ready to conduct credible business but did not have the capital.\n\n\u201cWe will help in providing jobs and employment for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN recently unveiled the \u2018100 for 100\u2019 policy on production and productivity to engender growth and employment.\n\nAccording to him, under the programme, targeted credit of up to N5bn will be provided to 100 firms every 100 days, provided the firms are investing in greenfield projects.\n\nHe said the projects would be assessed based on their ability to generate significant employment opportunities in critical sectors for the economy, adding that eligible firms would be made to show evidence of their efforts to harness available local raw materials towards the realisation of their intended investment.\n\nThe CBN governor said the bank remained committed to supporting eligible firms with foreign exchange to import machinery and equipment.",

          "text": "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), has warned that the recently announced excise duty on non-alcoholic beverages will cause a 0.43% contraction in output and about 40% drop on total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nDirector-General, MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, said this in Lagos, while reacting to the introduction of N10 excise duty on carbonated drinks as announced by the Federal Government on Wednesday, NAN reported.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, at the public breakdown of the 2022 Budget, said the government has introduced N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nAccording to her, the tax will discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages with its attendant health implications, while also raising revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures in line with the 2022 Budget priorities.\n\nHowever, reacting to the minister\u2019s announcement, Ajayi-kadir argued that food and beverages contributed the highest at 38% of the total manufacturing sector quota to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and comprised 22.5% of jobs and generated more than 1.5million jobs.\n\n\u201cOne is particularly worried about the ripple effect on the introduction of the excise, despite strenuous evidence-based advice to the contrary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will have an unpleasant impact on employment, households and consumers. As seen from previous impact analysis, excise affects production outputs, revenues and profits.\n\n\u201cThis causes companies to pursue cost-cutting measures to reduce the effect of diminishing revenue and profits by reducing employee salaries or retrenchment. So, this excise would certainly cast a sunset to this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, introducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\n\nAjayi-kadir insisted that the government\u2019s revenue aspirations in introducing this excise may not be justified in the long run.\n\nAccording to him, the excise estimated to generate N81 billion between 2022 and 2025 would not be sufficient to compensate the corresponding government\u2019s revenue losses in other taxes from the sector.\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor instance, the corresponding effect of reduced industry revenue on government revenues is estimated to be up to N142 billion contractions in Value Added Tax (VAT) raised by the sector and N54 billion Corporate Income Tax reduction between 2022 and 2025.\n\n\u201cThis is not to mention the potential negative impact on manufacturers/supply chain.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the 6th highest consumer of soft drink, but per capita consumption is low. Introducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\n\n\u201cA decrease in production levels or ability to purchase raw materials as a result of the introduction of excise tax will result in reduced profits for the supply chain players in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\n\n\u201cWhat is not realized by many is that excise begets high production costs, which in turn adversely affect production level, and ultimately results in dwindling profits.\n\n\u201cThis will grossly impact the small and emerging business owners in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, has disclosed that the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) will give a date for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention after its meeting on Sunday.\n\nHe disclosed this to State House correspondents on Friday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nRecall that President Buhari in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) aired on Thursday night, urged APC leaders to put their house in order so that the ruling party can retain power in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHe warned against the persistent differences, disunity, and lack of agreement, which could put the platform in jeopardy during the elections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe caretaker chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State also met with the President on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Lalong said the governors were working assiduously to hold the party\u2019s convention next month.\n\nHe further stated that President Buhari was still insisting that there must be an immediate convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, I agree that all the times there are meetings, especially taking final decisions on the party, I\u2019m always part of it and part of it was also why I visited the President and the President still stands committed that there must be an immediate convention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou know, when a convention is coming there are fears here and there, some people will tell you it will work, it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to a conclusion, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBy Sunday we will tell you when we\u2019re doing the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think our first date before Christmas we said we\u2019re going to do a convention in February and we are still working for convention, as far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThese are things that the President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own, the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing their own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, is also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to put our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is a cumulation of interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonize all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government,\u201d he added.",

There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,\u201d Poitier told Winfrey. \u201cI had in mind what was expected of me \u2014 not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself,\u201d Poitier told Oprah Winfrey in 2000.\n\nEarly on, Poitier made a conscious decision to reject roles that weren\u2019t consistent with his values or that reflected badly upon his race. He told Winfrey that as a struggling young actor, he turned down a role that paid $750 a week because he didn\u2019t like the character, a janitor who didn\u2019t respond after thugs killed his daughter and threw her body on his lawn.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine playing that part. So I said to myself, \u2018That\u2019s not the kind of work I want.\u2019 And I told my agent that I couldn\u2019t play the role,\u201d Poitier said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you play it? There\u2019s nothing derogatory about it in racial terms,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 He never understood.\u201d\n\nSuch was the stuff of Poitier\u2019s legendary life. Such was the determination that not only defined his life but also paved the way for his success. Such was the focus he had that he surmounted so many challenges including Hollywood\u2019s stereotypes.\n\n\u201cRacism was horrendous, but there were other aspects to life,\u201d he told Winfrey. \u201cThere are those who allow their lives to be defined only by race. I correct anyone who comes at me only in terms of race.\u201d\n\nThis was a man who after receiving an honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema in 2001 and accepting his best actor Oscar for \u201cTraining Day\u201d the following year, Denzel Washington said, \u201cForty years I\u2019ve been chasing Sidney. \u2026 I\u2019ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I\u2019ll always be following in your footsteps.\u201d\n\nHowever, a remarkable thing Poitier\u2019s grass to grace story is that not only did he come from a poor background (his parents were tomato farmers who often travelled to and from Florida and the Bahamas) he was not expected to live when he was born.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, he was born several months premature on 20 February 1927. He was so tiny he could fit in his father\u2019s hand. His mother consulted a palm reader, who assuaged her fears\n\n\u201cThe lady took her hand and started speaking to my mother: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about your son. He will survive,'\u201d Poitier told CBS News in 2013. \u201cAnd these were her words; she said, \u2018He will walk with kings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen he was 15, Poitier\u2019s parents sent him from the Bahamas to live with an older brother in Miami, where they figured he would have better opportunities. His father took him to the dock and put $3 in his hand.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018take care of yourself, son.\u2019 And he turned me around to face the boat,\u201d Poitier told NPR in 2009.\n\nRelated News Rain of tributes as legendary actor Sidney Poitier dies\n\nPoitier didn\u2019t like Miami and soon headed north to New York, where he tried his hand at acting. It did not go well at first. With limited schooling, he had trouble reading a script. But he got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where a fortuitous encounter changed his life. An elderly waiter took an interest in the teen and spent nights after work reading the newspaper with him to improve his comprehension, grammar and punctuation.\n\n\u201cThat man, every night, the place is closed, everyone\u2019s gone, and he sat there with me week after week after week,\u201d Poitier told CBS News. \u201cAnd he told me about punctuations. He told me where dots were and what the dots mean here between these two words, all of that stuff.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Poitier landed work with the American Negro Theatre, where he took acting lessons, softened his Bahamian accent and landed a stage role as an understudy to Harry Belafonte. This led to roles on Broadway and eventually caught the attention of Hollywood.\n\nSpeaking on a live Facebook stream on Friday, The Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, where his parentss originally hailed from summed up his life in a befitting tribute:\n\n\u201cOur whole Bahamas grieves. But even as we mourn, we celebrate the life of a great Bahamian.\u201dHe added: \u201cHis strength of character, his willingness to stand up and be counted and the way he plotted and navigated his life\u2019s journey.\n\n\u201cThe boy who moved from the tomato farm to become a waiter in the United States, a young man who not only taught himself to read and write, but who made the expression of words and thoughts and feelings central to his career.\u201d\n\nThis indeed sums up the life of an actor who came from an impoverished background but later went to win the Oscar for 1963\u2019s \u201cLilies of the Field,\u201d in which he played an itinerant laborer who helps a group of White nuns build a chapel.\n\nMany of his best-known films explored racial tensions as Americans were grappling with social changes wrought by the civil rights movement. In 1967 alone, he appeared as a Philadelphia detective fighting bigotry in small-town Mississippi in \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and a doctor who wins over his White fianc\u00e9e\u2019s skeptical parents in \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the momentous events in his life was when he played Norman Jewison\u2019s \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d which gave Poitier his most enduring role. He played Virgil Tibbs, a homicide detective passing through Mississippi when he is detained by a bigoted White police chief (Rod Steiger) as a possible suspect in a slaying. Tibbs reluctantly agrees to stay and help solve the case, and the two men eventually find a grudging mutual respect.\n\nThe movie gave Poitier his most famous line \u2014 \u201cThey call me Mister Tibbs!\u201d \u2014 an indignant cry for respect after a demeaning slur by Steiger\u2019s character.\n\nIn another memorable scene, Tibbs is slapped in the face by a racist plantation owner and then slaps him right back. Before agreeing to do the film, Poitier requested a script change to add the retaliatory slap and even rewrote his contract to prohibit the studio from cutting the scene.\n\n\u201cAnd of course it is one of those great, great moments in all of film, when you slap him back,\u201d CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl told Poitier in 2013. He replied, \u201cYes, I knew that I would have been insulting every Black person in the world (if I hadn\u2019t).\u201d\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama said Poitier \u201cepitomised dignity and grace\u201d and had \u201csingular talent\u201d. He added that the actor revealed \u201cthe power of movies to bring us closer together\u201d and \u201copened doors for a generation of actors\u201d.\n\nUS broadcaster and journalist Oprah Winfrey also paid tribute, saying: \u201cFor me the greatest of the \u2018Great Trees\u2019 has fallen,\u201d adding the actor \u201chad an enormous soul I will forever cherish\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2026Urge FG to declare emergency on food security\n\n\u2026MRO, Coconut refinery, Ibom Deep Seaport, huge foreign exchange for A\u2019Ibom- Gov. Emmanuel\n\nThere was jubilation in Abuja on Friday as Nigerians at home and in the diaspora called on Akwa Ibom State Governor, His Excellency, Mr Udom Emmanuel to contest the 2023 presidentail elections in order to replicate his industrialization policy and use his creative financial and economic ingenuity to salvage the Nigerian dwindling and almost collapsing economy.\n\nThis was part of reactions that trailed the Governor\u2019s live interview when he appeared as a Guest on Brekette Family Radio Live Talk Show in Abuja, hosted by the Ordinary President, Ahmed Isah on Brekete Family on Human Rights Radio 101.1 FM, Abuja, where the Governor spoke on his achievements in the last six years and on the State of the Nation.\n\nFollowing his numerous achievements in the last six years as Governor, his hosts, Ahmed Isah and other phone in callers called on him to get set to contest for the office of President come 2023, promising to mobilize ordinary Nigerians to contribute funds to finance the electioneering cost. \u201cNow we are begging you. Soon we\u2019ll lead a massive protest if you refuse to heed the plea of Nigerians. The country is bleeding. We need someone like you to use the knowledge of what you have done in Akwa Ibom to salvage the country, Isah declared.\n\nThe Governor asked those clamouring for him to run for the presidency to rather pray over their demand to seek God\u2019s blessings and direction while he concentrates on completing the mandate Akwa Ibom people gave him through the ballot.\n\nListing his achievements in office as Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Governor Emmanuel said the time has come for leaders to think outside the box on how to run the economy, a factor he said inspired him to conceive the idea of developing the three gateway of land, air and sea in Akwa Ibom.\n\nHe explained that apart from linking all the local government areas with access roads including the neighboring states, his administration has expanded on the vision of his predecessors to develop the MRO of the Ibom International Airport to allow for all aircrafts within the African continent to be serviced, maintained and overhauled in Akwa Ibom, a feat he noted will bring foreign exchange to the state.\n\nAccording to the Governor, his administration is looking beyond oil which explains why he is currently test running the multi million dollar coconut refinery in the state of which five foreign countries are currently in Akwa Ibom to understudy the idea, technology and expertise in order to replicate same in their home country.\n\nHe explained that despite the price of crude oil per barrel at the International energy market, a litre of virgin coconut goes for $6 which means coconut oil is more costly and profitable than crude, this he said was another way his administration is diversifying both the State\u2019s economy and it\u2019s revenue profile.\n\nHe regreted that despite Akwa Ibom sitting on top over 31.1% of oil and gas reserve in the country, the state has no NNPC depot, no DPR or PPMC presence in the state which is why he has built Nigeria\u2019s seventh most tallest building named the Dakadda Towers with 21 floors to provide accomodations for investors and multinationals as well as the Luxury Estate which will be built to accommodate foreigners from all over the world.\n\nHe warned of great economic crisis due to the impending food scarcity occasioned by banditry and farmers/herders crisis that has impeded the ability of farmers to go to their farmlands to cultivate food, warning that with a country of over 200 million citizens, the looming food crisis is one national crisis that be better imagined than experienced and that the time to act is now.\n\nOn Power, he revealed that his administration is targeting power for all but regretted that despite producing enough power for consumption, the power so generated cannot be adequately transmitted to end users, and called on the federal government to rise beyond partisanship and grant him license to distribute the power generated by Ibom Power so that citizens and residents of the state can enjoy uninterrupted power supply.\n\n\u201cIf the power Ibom Power generates is adequately distributed, Engineers in the power sector have assured me that my people would by now be enjoying up to 21 hours of power per day\u201d, he said.\n\nHe noted that if power is available, affordable and accessible to small and medium scale businesses, the average barber or salon owner will run his or her business at a reduced cost and make more profit.\n\nHe announced that his administration also made available an interest free loan of #2 billion for market women, announcing his intention to add more funds to it to make it a revolving loan to stimulate the growth of SME\u2019s in the state.\n\nAccording to Governor Emmanuel, his vision is to ensure the state has a modern health system that will cater for the health needs of citizens and residents which explains why he has revamped and equipped ten General Hospitals in the ten federal constituencies and link it up to education which is why his government is investing massively in making education free at the basic level as modalities have reached advanced stage to make the Vocational Training Center in the state functional so as to equip students with skills needed to make them self reliant upon graduation.\n\nOn agriculture, Governor Emmanuel said the state is investing massively in encouraging people to cultivate vegetable and that a tomato processing plant has been put in place to ensure harvested tomatoes are processed and marketed to curb waste, improve storage and create wealth for farmers in the state.",

There will come a day when this country will be sold off.\u201d\n\nNdugai, who was a strong supporter of Hassan\u2019s late predecessor John Magufuli and had also served as deputy speaker from 2010 to 2015, apologised to Hassan on Monday, saying his remarks were misunderstood.\n\nTundu Lissu of the main opposition Chadema party, whose leader was arrested in July and charged with terrorism offences, described Ndugai as \u201cthe most despicable speaker in the 96 years of our parliament\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis forced resignation, though, confirms that Tanzania has only one omnipotent & untouchable arm of the State: the President. A new democratic Constitution is an urgent & imperative order of the day!\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nIn June last year, Ndugai was subject to ridicule after he ordered a woman lawmaker who was wearing trousers to leave parliament because of her \u201cstrange\u201d attire.\n\nHe also angered Chadema in May when he refused, in defiance of Tanzanian law, to expel lawmakers whose membership of the party had been revoked.\n\nHassan became president of the East African country after the death of Magufuli, who was nicknamed the \u201cBulldozer\u201d for his authoritarian leadership style and who oversaw a crackdown on dissent during his rule.\n\nShe has sought to break with some of Magufuli\u2019s policies, but fears remain about the state of political and media freedoms in the country.",

          "text": "\u2026Lassa fever killed 92 Nigerians in 2021- Report \u2026Prepare for fresh, deadlier outbreaks, NMA warns \u2026No coordinated effort to reduce casualties \u2013 Expert \u2026Nigeria currently experiencing fourth wave \u2013 NCDC\n\nNigeria is currently witnessing a resurgence of Lassa fever amidst the fourth wave of Covid-19 pandemic occasioned by the Omicron variants. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the current outbreak.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recently disclosed that 16 states have recorded at least one confirmed case of Lassa fever across 66 local government areas in the country. This was disclosed in the agency\u2019s latest Lassa fever situation report for week 49 spanning from December 6-20.\n\nThe report also indicated that Lassa fever has killed 92 people in the country in 2021.The confirmed figures resulting from Lassa fever were recorded in Ondo -45, Edo -14, Taraba -12, Kaduna -4, Bauchi -3, Ebonyi -2, Nasarawa -2, and Enugu -1.\n\nNCDC also noted that eight health workers have been infected with the viral disease. It added that the number of new confirmed cases increased from 4 in week 48, 2021 to 10 cases -These were reported from Ondo, Edo, and Nasarawa states.\n\n\u201cCumulatively from week 1 to week 49, 2021, 92 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 18.7 per cent which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (20.7 per cent). In total for 2021, 16 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 64 local government areas.\n\n\u201cOf all confirmed cases, 84 per cent are from Edo (44 per cent), Ondo (35 per cent) and Taraba (five per cent) states,\u201d the Centre stated.\n\nSimilarly, two senior consultant gynecologists have reportedly died of Lassa fever at the Dalhatu Arafat Specialist Hospital (DASH) in Lafia, Nasarawa state.\n\nBlueprint weekend learnt that they contracted the disease during an emergency caesarian operation conducted on a woman, who was bleeding and admitted at the hospital, but unknown to the doctors that she had Lassa fever.\n\nA source at the hospital confirmed that the pregnant woman was rushed to the hospital over complications arising from Lassa fever, but the consultants, who attended to her, thought it was pregnancy-related complications. The woman and the baby died some hours after the surgery.\n\nIt was further learnt that the test result showed that she had Lassa fever, which actually led to complications that resulted in premature labour that necessitated her being rushed to the hospital on emergency.\n\nThe source also disclosed that one of the doctors, who performed the operation, died last week and that the test result confirmed that he died of Lassa fever, while the second doctor has died.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Mrs. Ruth Namo, confirmed that the two gynecologists died of Lassa fever.\n\nNMA\u2019s warnings\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has advised the country to prepare for possibly fresh and deadlier Lassa fever outbreaks.\n\nIts president, Prof. Innocent Ujah, at the opening of the December National Executive Council (NEC) meeting (Caliphate City 2021) recently in Sokoto, expressed concerns over emerging and re-emerging infections.\n\nHe stressed the need to continually put together effective outbreak prevention and control measures that were culturally appropriate, relevant and feasible for communities to check unnecessary loss of life and minimise disruptions to essential services.\n\nThe obstetrician and gynaecologist canvassed uninterrupted community engagement, social mobilisation and communication for effective prevention and control of these emerging diseases.\n\nUjah said \u201cthis is on the premise that every outbreak is unique and community understanding of diseases and their spread are complex, context-dependent and culturally mediated; hence the need for effective coordination.\u201d\n\nThe NMA boss said Nigeria \u201chas the opportunity of applying the World Health Organisation (WHO) outbreak communication principles geared at preventing exposure, stopping transmission and providing relevant public health information for an overarching goal before, during and after epidemics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will help in building and maintaining public trust in the prevention and control of outbreaks,\u201d he said.\n\nUjah said Nigerian medical doctors and other frontline health workers \u201chave been at risk of contracting these infectious diseases, adding that many had been infected and survived, while some lost their lives in the course of discharging their duties.\u201d\n\nOmicron\n\nSadly, Nigeria is witnessing resurgence in Lassa fever infections amidst the fourth wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the NCDC also announced the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria on December 20, 2021.\n\nIt stated that the country has recorded a 500 per cent increase in the number of confirmed cases within the past two weeks.\n\nThe director-general of the Centre, IfedayoAdefila, in a statement, noted that the rise in infections had been linked to both the Delta and Omicron variants of the rampaging virus.\n\nHowever, the latest statistics by the NCDC showed that Nigeria\u2019s infection toll had increased to 233,353, while the fatality toll stands at 2,991.\n\nAs of Wednesday, December 15, the number of active cases increased from 12,547 to 16,569 cases, while the number of discharged cases now stands at 212,040. The data also shows that Nigeria has so far tested 3,751,696 samples.\n\nCommunity transmission\n\nLikewise, the NCDC confirmed the community transmission of the Covid-19 Omicron variant even as it disclosed that \u201cNigeria has not recorded any death from the variant.\u201d\n\nMaking the disclosure during a webinar on the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, Dr. Adetifa said additional 39 cases of the Omicron variant had been discovered bringing the total to 45. He added that the Omicron had pushed up the number of cases of coronavirus in the country, and that \u201cthe variant is gradually becoming dominant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe six earlier detected Omicron cases were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa. It is important for Nigerians to maintain physical distance and avoid contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.\n\n\u201cWe are counting on you to celebrate responsibly and take responsibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from Covid-19.\u201d\n\nLassa fever\n\nA consultant virologist at University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, FunshoIdrisu, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend shed more light on the disease.\n\nHe said, \u201cLassa fever is a severe and often-fatal hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Since it was originally discovered in 1969 in the village of Lassa in Borno state, there have been countless outbreaks of various magnitude and severity across West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe Lassa virus is a member of the Arenaviridae virus family. Humans contract the virus primarily through contact with the contaminated excreta of Mastomysnatalensis rodents commonly known as the multi-mammate rats, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus.\n\n\u201cThe rodents live in bushes, but because of dry season, they run to houses for protection and live with humans and deposit excreta on floors, tables, beds and foods.\n\n\u201cThe foods that can be contaminated by the rodents include garri, yam, rice and beans, among others. So, people should cover their foods properly, avoid taking soaked garri that was not covered. While feeding on the foods, the rodents defecate and urinate on them, which is not good for human consumption. So, people should not eat leftover foods without properly warming them.\n\n\u201cThe virus is transmitted to humans through cuts and scratches. In some regions, mastomys rodents are consumed as food, but it is better for people to avoid contact with rodents.\n\n\u201cIn the early stages, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed as influenza, typhoid or malaria, and as a result many patients fail to receive appropriate medical treatment. Making a correct diagnosis of Lassa fever is made difficult by the wide spectrum of clinical effects that manifest, ranging from asymptomatic to multi-organ system failure and death. The onset of the illness is typically indolent, with no specific symptoms to distinguish it from other febrile illnesses.\u201d\n\nWhat we eat\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a public health consultant, Dr. Uche Okolie, urged Nigerians to be wary of buying snacks wrapped in newspapers or other unhygienic means.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is also important to bring to the attention of Nigerians that we should be wary of smoked meat slices (suya), bean cake (popularly called akara in local parlance), roasted corn and other food items or snacks that are usually sold by wrapping them in old newspapers or other paper materials where rodents might have excreted on them.\n\n\u201cThat paper-wrapped food item may not be washed or rinsed before consumption so it becomes unhealthy to eat. It is therefore not hygienic to keep food items in used papers. These papers may not, by mere visual inspection, reveal rodents\u2019 urine or excreta, so difficulty may arise in discerning which ones are contaminated or not. One never can tell if these papers have come in contact with excreta from rats. When an individual then consumes food items wrapped in these contaminated papers, such a one may be at high risk of contracting Lassa fever. It is, therefore, advisable to play safe by taking your container to receive the food items at the point of sales or requesting them to be sold in a safe and healthy wrapper.\u201d\n\nHe also warned Nigerians against the consumption of cassava flakes (garri) to avoid contracting Lassa fever. He said the rats that caused the disease were mostly in contact with the most popular Nigerian staple food, garri.\n\n\u201cWhen garri is soaked in ordinary water and consumed, one is exposed to the risk of contracting Lassa fever. But if the water is boiled to make eba, it could go a long way to kill the bacteria caused by pests or rodents in garri.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s view\n\nAlso, a virologist, Dr. Chris Osakwe, of Doctors without Borders in an interview with Blueprint Weekend queried Nigeria\u2019s poor handling of the disease over the years.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe rash of deaths recorded across the country in the wake of the ongoing Lassa fever outbreak is evidence that not much has changed over the years in the management and control of the disease in Nigeria. If any lessons have been learnt at all from previous experiences, they are obviously not being put to proper use to contain the high incidence of the deadly disease. Instead of witnessing a decline in yearly infection rates, Lassa fever cases appear to have become more widespread in the country.\n\n\u201cMore cases are still being recorded on a daily basis. For a disease that is not so strange to the country\u2019s health authorities, there should be better ways of handling it to reasonably bring down the casualty figures. In particular, health care workers, as professionals, should take their self-protection more seriously to reduce the soaring number of casualties among them.\n\n\u201cDespite the annual harvest of deaths, there has not been a well-coordinated, determined and focused effort to reduce the casualty rate and, possibly, eradicate the disease. For a disease that is both curable, if early medical intervention is sought, and preventable through observance of adequate personal hygiene, this is not good enough. Indeed, the figures are alarming and it is getting to a stage where the government can ill afford to continue to ignore them.\u201d\n\nPreventive measures\n\nOn how not to contract the disease, an environmental health scientist Mustapha Haruna, said hygiene is critical in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cThere are many things Nigeria can do to halt the spread of the deadly Lassa fever. The fever has caused devastation in the lives of Nigerians for 51 years, with the virus not prompting changes in the way and manner Africa\u2019s largest economy responds to outbreaks and other health emergencies. Many years down the line, the virus has continued to stage a comeback, with outbreaks already reported in different states of the country.\n\n\u201cIn prevention of Lassa fever, it is critical to maintain a high level of hygiene around the home, which could help to keep rats at bay.\n\n\u201cApart from keeping the home clean, it is also important for the environment to be kept clean and refuse dumpsites to be far away from residences. This falls under the purview of the local government which, in the past, had sanitary inspectors that moved from house-to-house to enforce compliance with accepted standards of cleanliness. Those whose duty it is to clean the drains should be made to do their job to reduce the breeding ground for rodents,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth workers\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Osakwe advised health care practitioners to always observe safety precautions whenever attending to patients. He also advised the general public to store food items, especially grains, garri and powdered food in air-tight containers.\n\n\u201cThe general public should endeavour to quickly report any case of high grade fever not responding to anti-malarial treatment to the nearest hospital, so that quick diagnosis and treatment can be instituted. Early presentation has a good prognosis,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to relevant governments and stakeholders to be serious with the welfare of health personnel. He noted that health personnel risk their lives under a very poor remuneration.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine that the hazard allowance for a doctor is just N5, 000, while those who are not exposed to any risk are being paid allowances running into millions of Naira?\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said joining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by corrupt politicians would not save them against prosecution by anti-graft agencies.\n\nThe president said this in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) monitored in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people really to even be corrupt.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the defectors would not be allowed to go scot-free, the president said: \u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused.\n\n\u201cBut luckily I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels. Behave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarrelling and a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nUrges democracy in APC\n\nOn his party, he said there was need to follow democratic process in selecting the person who would succeed him, stressing that he is not a kingmaker who would determine the next president.\n\nHe said any governor that tries to impose a candidate on the people in the forthcoming elections would face problems.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituents, they will know their positions, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after Abuja. So those who want to be elected at any level let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nParty wrangling\n\nCommenting on the forthcoming APC national convention and the internal wrangling within the party, he said there was the need to address all issues to be able to retain power.\n\n\u201cWe have time frame; we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off, they are still are still off, they can see it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also said he does not expect Nigerians to appreciate him when he leaves office, saying he has done his best.\n\n\u201cYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as president. So, I have gone through the system. And really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the South-east now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing? We closed the border with Benin; we closed the border with Niger.\n\n\u201cBut we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armouries; police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also expressed optimism that the insecurity in the country can be resolved before he leaves office, stressing that security forces were working hard on it just as more equipment and ammunition were being procured.\n\n\u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it because members of the security, the armed forces and others, they are all security, it depends on one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo no matter, when people are selfish, is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the North-east and South-south and how much progress we have made and acquiring some helicopters, aircraft, their maintenance, their ammunition, armoured cars, you know to counter effectively, the bandits, they cost money and they cost time for training and adaptation,\u201d he said.\n\nLong hours tiring\n\nThe president also admitted that the current long hours he spends working is telling on him because of his age, saying he looks forward to the end of his tenure in 17 months to join his colleagues in retirement.\n\nAsked how he felt clocking 79 recently, the President said: \u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see you, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time.\n\n\u201cAnd about my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day flight in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered, virtually every week, so, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government Thursday said it has no plan to disengage civil servants because of the nation\u2019s economic downturn.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed stated this while featuring on the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA)\u2019s \u2018Good Morning Nigeria\u2019 programme monitored by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nThe minister said President Muhammadu Buhari has always remained an advocate of workers\u2019 welfare and would never mandate a mass disengagement of the nation\u2019s public workforce.\n\nShe, however, said the government would reduce overheads by ensuring merger of its agencies.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came against the backdrop of media reports (not in Blueprint) that government was planning to sack workers over cash crunch.\n\nDebunking the reports, the minister said: \u201cMr President doesn\u2019t want to disengage staff. That is what he has directed from the beginning of his administration. He also directed that we pay salaries. The federal government has never failed in paying salaries and he said we must always pay pensions.\n\n\u201cSo, he has been consistent in those directives and we have followed those directives to the letter.\u201d\n\nHinting on plans to cut down on expenditures in various agencies and ministries, she said this remained the only way to ensure reduced cost of governance.\n\n\u201cWell, we do hope that at the end of the exercise, some agencies will be merged and it will cut down operational costs.\n\n\u201cAnd also we will be able to come up with incentive packages to retrain people and redeploy them in some areas where they are useful. For example, we still have a very high need for teachers so we can retrain people and send them to teach but also incentive packages to exit. Again, that is also money. If you want people to exit you have to pay them.\n\n\u201cThat is an incentive package so that they can go. That is why it is taking a lot of time because it is not easy to decide on this. Everything centres on resources.\n\n\u201cWe need resources and if we had a lot of money, we would just give very beautiful incentive packages and people would exit and go and start their businesses and we would reduce the size of the personnel cost,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nFG\u2019s N10bn to Nigerians\n\nIn a related development, the federal government said it pays two million households N5, 000 monthly, the cost of which comes to N10 billion.\n\nSimilarly, the government said over 10 million Nigerian pupils benefit from its school feeding programme since the government\u2019s initiative commenced.\n\nNational Coordinator National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) Dr Umar Bindr said this at the NSIP annual strategic review meeting Thursday in Abuja.\n\nBindir said the households were captured under its Conditional Cash Transfer programme.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have more than 10 million applicants nationwide. We have successfully managed to onboard two million, and we are consistently paying these households N5, 000 per month. The households have an average number of five to seven people.\n\n\u201cWe are feeding an average of 10 million children nationwide. By the end of 2021, there were only two states that were not on boarded, Kwara and Bayelsa. But I\u2019m happy to report that they are now aligned, so we are nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn challenges confronting the programme, Bindir said: \u201cThe first challenge is that there are people who will try to scuttle the programme. There are reports whereby we see schools that don\u2019t exist actually reported. We drop them from the list.\n\n\u201cThere are situations where the number of pupils in schools is being inflated. There are areas where the cooking is not taking place and then we are paying cooks.\n\n\u201cThere are areas where the aggregators for the food are aggregating the wrong food and they are short-changing the children.\u201d",

          "title": "VIDEO: Sylvester Oromoni\u2019s Death Not Caused By Poison, Torture \u2013 Police",
          "text": "Police authorities in Lagos State on Friday said the 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lekki, Sylvester Oromoni, died a natural death.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, disclosed this while briefing reporters at the Command Headquarters in Ikeja on the investigations conducted into the death of the boy.\n\nHe stated that the final results of the post-mortem and toxicology examination conducted in Lagos and Delta indicated the cause of the death was natural.\n\n[READ ALSO] Oromoni: Lagos Govt Clears Five Dowen Students, Staff, Orders Release Of Suspects\n\nAccording to the police commissioner, the police position was the submission of Dr S. Soyemi, the consultant pathologist who led a team of pathologists to carry out the autopsy.\n\nThe findings, he said, confirmed that there was no evidence to establish a case of torture, bullying and forceful application of poisonous substances against the students and staff of the school arrested by the police.\n\nOdumosu stressed that all the suspects denied the allegations of torture, bullying, and administering of poisonous substances to the deceased.\n\nHe added that the allegation that the deceased was forced to join a cult group was also not established, as the students interviewed denied the claim.\n\nThe briefing held two days after the Lagos State government cleared the students and employees of the school accused of complicity in the death of Sylvester.\n\nThis followed the legal advice of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) in Lagos, Ms Adetutu Oshinusi, that the interim and final autopsy reports issued in Lagos and Delta were in agreement as to the cause of death.\n\nSepticaemia, lobar pneumonia with acute pyelonephritis, pyomyositis of the right ankle and acute bacteria pneumonia, all due to severe sepsis led to the death of Sylvester.\n\nRead the full text of the police commissioner\u2019s briefing below:\n\nSYLVESTER OROMONI JNR: UPDATE ON INVESTIGATION\n\nGentlemen of the Press, I am compelled by necessity of duty and in the interest of justice, transparency and openness, to invite you here this afternoon to give an update on investigation carried out into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, the 12- year-old student of Dowen College, Lekki.\n\nThe case has attracted comments and reactions from different quarters, individuals and parents insinuating a cover-up. The comments, reactions and insinuations have necessitated the need to do this press conference.\n\nGentlemen of the press, following a formal complaint received on 2nd December 2021 via a petition dated 1/12/2021 written by V.O. Grant & Co, and signed by A.E. Efole et al, the DPO Maroko was immediately directed to carry out preliminary investigation into the incident notwithstanding that the incident was not reported at any police station.\n\nSame day the petition was received, DPO Maroko commenced preliminary investigation by visiting the Dowen College, Maroko on a fact-finding mission. However, due to the seriousness of the incident and the dare need to carry out diligent investigation, the State CID was directed by me to take over investigation of the case with immediate effect.\n\nIn compliance with this directive, the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti took over the case on 3rd December 2021 and continued investigation in earnest. In the course of investigation, eight suspects were arrested. The suspects included three House Masters of the College and five students who were said to have been mentioned by the deceased before his death.\n\nThe suspects were; Students i. Ansel Temile \u2018m\u2019 aged 14 ii. Michael Kashamu \u2018m\u2019 aged 15 iii. Kenneth Inyang \u2018m\u2019 aged 15 iv. Favour Benjamin \u2018m\u2019 aged 16 v. Edward Begue \u2018m\u2019 aged 16 House masters vi. Valentine Igbokwe \u2018m aged 45 vii. Ahmed Bariyu \u2018m\u2019 aged 52 viii. Adesanya Olusegun \u2018m aged 42\n\nA remand warrant dated 7th December 2021 was obtained at the Yaba Magistrate Court to enable the police detain the suspects for 21 days in the first instance while investigation continued. On 9th December 2021, all the parties including the deceased\u2019s family, the school management, and witnesses were interviewed by me at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja.\n\nDuring the open interview, it was unanimously agreed that another autopsy should be carried out where pathologists from all parties would be present. Investigation was extended to Delta State and Abuja.\n\nGentlemen of the press, I will like to state here that investigation revealed that same case was reported at the Area Command Warri, Delta State on 1st December 2021. It has also been established that a post-mortem examination was initially carried out on 2nd December 2021 by a Consultant Pathologist, Dr. Clement Vhriterhire of the Central Hospital, Warri, Delta State.\n\nThe result of the first autopsy dated 10th December 2021 attributed cause of death to \u2018acute lung injury due to ?? chemical intoxication in a background of blunt force trauma\u2019. However, toxicology screening was recommended and carried out. While waiting for the result of the toxicology, another autopsy was ordered by the Coroner Magistrate in Lagos because of the status of jurisdiction.\n\nThe corpse was, therefore, moved with armed police escorts from Delta State to Lagos State by TOS Funeral and the autopsy conducted at the expense of the Lagos State Government. The second autopsy was carried out at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on 14th December 2021 in the presence of representatives of all the parties involved in the case.\n\nThe second autopsy was carried out by Dr. S.S Soyemi, the Consultant Pathologist and Chief Examiner, Department of Pathology and Forensic Sciences, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos. The autopsy was witnessed by the following:\n\nDr Uwon Eze, a consultant Pathologist from UCH represented Timile\u2019s family Dr. Badmus Kabiru, Consultant Pathologist from LUTH represented Dowen College\n\niii. Dr. Nwigwe Chikodili Isabella, Consultant Pathologist from Military Hospital Yaba represented Edward Brown, student of Dowen College\n\nDr. Clemet Vhriterhire, Consultant Pathologist who performed the first autopsy represented the family of the deceased Dr. Musa Stephen Itopa, Consultant Pathologist from UPTH represented Michael Kasamu, student of Dowen College Dr. F.E. Emiogun, Consultant Pathologist in LASUTH\n\nvii. Dr. O.O. KilaUvie-Emegbo, Consultant Pathologist in LASUTH\n\nviii. Dr. O.O. Onayemi, senior Registrar in LASUTH\n\nDr. M.Salisu, senior Registrar on autopsy posting in LASUTH Dr. A.C. Chima, Registrar from ABU on autopsy posting in LASUTH Dr. F. Emetomah, Registrar\n\nxii. CSP Rasak Oseni, Homicide Section, represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command.\n\nXiii. DSP Olusegun Bamidele, Homicide Section, also represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command\n\nXiv. Sgt. Shola Adeniyi, Homicide Section, represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command.\n\nBefore the expiration of the 21 days remand order, the families of the students applied for their bail at the Magistrate Court 1 Yaba. The application was approved hence the students who were earlier remanded at Boys Home, Oregun were granted bail.\n\nThe House Masters were also granted bail after the expiration of the 21 days remand order. The result of the second autopsy carried out in Lagos was released on 21st December 2021. The result attributed the cause of death to \u2018Septicaemia, lobar pneumonia with acute pyelonephritis and pyomyositis of the right ankle\u2019.\n\nOn 30th December 2021, the toxicology screening results of the first autopsy carried out in Warri was released. The result issued and signed by Dr Clement Vhriterhire, same doctor who carried out the initial autopsy attributed the cause of death to \u2018acute bacterial pneumonia due to severe sepsis\u2019\n\nAt the end of diligent investigation carried out so far, there is no evidence to establish a case of torture, bullying and forceful application of poisonous substances against the suspects. All the suspects denied the allegations of torture, bullying and administering of poisonous substances to the deceased.\n\nAllegation that the deceased was being forced to join a cult group was also not established as other students interviewed denied this. Final results of the post-mortem and toxicology examination conducted both at Warri and Lagos agreed that the deceased died a natural death. For purpose of clarification, it is pertinent to convey to members of the public in simple terms, the commentary/submission of Dr. SS Soyemi, the consultant pathologist who led a team of pathologists to carry out the autopsy.\n\nHe declared and I quote: \u2018Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, a 12-year old student of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos, reportedly died on November 30, 2021, at a private hospital in Warri, Delta State. It was alleged that the deceased was physically assaulted and poisoned in the school prior to death.\n\n\u2018The first autopsy was done in Warri on December 2, 2021. Following an order for a second autopsy, the body of the deceased was brought to Lagos for a second autopsy. Our findings at the second autopsy include marked pallor of organs, pneumonia (infection of the lungs), infections of the liver and kidneys, as well as the heart.\n\n\u2018These infections emanated from the ankle infection described earlier in the report. Microscopic sections also confirmed these findings. Death was caused by Septicaemia following infections of the lungs and kidneys arising from the ankle wound. No evidence of blunt force trauma in this body. The findings in the oesophagus and stomach are not compatible with chemical intoxication. Death, in this case, is natural.\u2019\n\nDespite this and following legal procedure, the case file was duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. Legal advice, however, indicated that \u2018there is no prima facie case of murder, involuntary manslaughter and or malicious administering of poison with intent to harm\u2019 against the students and the House Masters, hence they cannot be prosecuted. Hence, they were all released on bail. The final result of the autopsy and DPP advice were officially released by the state government earlier in the week.\n\nGentlemen of the Press, in spite of the transparent investigation, carried out by the police and the non-establishment of prima facie case against the suspects, some members of the Ijaw Youths Council, Lagos led by one Comrade Henry Oyobolo protested in front of Bowen College for over two hours yesterday 6th January 2022.\n\nThe protesters, including masquerades, carried placards and were drumming, thereby causing panic and apprehension. The protesters who conducted themselves in a manner capable of causing breach of peace also caused temporary traffic jam. But for the professional way the police managed the protest, it would have led to violence.\n\nMuch as we commiserate with the bereaved family on the death of their lovely and promising child, it is advised that the protesters and other individuals or groups who are still aggrieved should go to the law court to seek redress instead of taking the law into their own hands.\n\nThus, members of the public who may have any misgivings about the outcome of the police investigation, medical enquiry and legal advice with this case are advised to follow due process in law rather than resorting to self-help.\n\nThe police will not fold their arms and allow any act or omission that could threaten the peace being enjoyed in the state. Thanks and God bless you all.",

          "text": "The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is killing people across the globe and should not be dismissed as mild, the World Health Organization insisted Thursday.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the record numbers of people catching the new variant \u2014 which is rapid out-competing the previously-dominant Delta variant in many countries \u2014 meant hospitals were being overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWhile Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild,\u201d Tedros told a press conference.\n\n\u201cJust like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world.\u201d\n\nJust under 9.5 million new Covid-19 cases were reported to the WHO last week \u2014 a record, up 71 percent on the week before.\n\nBut even this was an underestimate, Tedros said, as it did not reflect the backlog of testing around the Christmas-New Year holidays, positive self-tests not registered, and overburdened surveillance systems missing cases.\n\nVaccination targets slipping away\n\nTedros used his first speech of 2022 to slam the way rich nations hogged available vaccine doses last year, saying it had created the perfect breeding ground for the emergence of virus variants.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the world to share out vaccine doses more fairly in 2022, to end the \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d of Covid-19.\n\nTedros wanted every country to have 10 percent of their population vaccinated by the end of September 2021 and 40 percent by the end of December.\n\nNinety-two of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states missed the target set for the end of 2021 \u2014 indeed 36 of them had not even jabbed the first 10 percent, largely due to being unable to access doses.\n\nTedros wants 70 percent jabbed in every country by mid-2022.\n\nOn the current pace of vaccine roll-out, 109 countries will miss that target.\n\n\u201cVaccine inequity is a killer of people and jobs and it undermines a global economic recovery,\u201d said Tedros.\n\n\u201cBooster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected.\u201d\n\nOmicron is not the end\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that Omicron would be the last variant of concern before the pandemic is over.\n\nIn facing the more transmissible Omicron variant, Van Kerkhove urged people to step up the measures they were already taking to protect themselves against the virus.\n\n[READ ALSO] COVID-19: Election Rallies Cancelled As India Sees Omicron Surge\n\n\u201cDo everything that we have been advising better, more comprehensively, more purposefully,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need people to hang in there and really fight.\u201d\n\nVan Kerkhove added that she was stunned by how sloppily some people were wearing facemasks.\n\n\u201cIt needs to cover your nose and mouth\u2026 wearing a mask below your chin is useless,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking ahead to this year, Bruce Aylward, the WHO\u2019s frontman on accessing coronavirus tools, added that there was \u201cno need to finish 2022 in a pandemic\u201d.\n\nBut WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that without vaccine equity, \u201cwe will be sitting here at the end of 2022 having somewhat the same conversation, which, in itself, would be a great tragedy\u201d.",

          "title": "NLC Rejects FG\u2019s Plan To Increase Tax On Carbonated Drinks",
          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is rejecting plans by the Federal Government to increase taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\n\nNLC\u2019s position is contained in a statement signed by its President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, which was circulated to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe government had announced the increased taxes as a way of discouraging over-consumption of sugar, checking obesity, and also generating more money to fund the 2022 budget.\n\nBut the union believes implementing increased taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks, which is one of the provisions in the 2021 Finance Act, will impose more hardship on the citizens.\n\nThe NLC, therefore, asked the National Assembly to urgently amend the sections of the Finance Act which re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nOn the 31st of December 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari signed into law the Finance Act. Some of the provisions of the Finance Act includes the imposition of excise duties on locally produced non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sugary drinks.\n\nThe reason offered by government for this decision was to discourage the consumption of sugar by Nigerians as it has led to upsurge in obesity and diabetes. In a letter dated 27th November 2021, the Nigeria Labour Congress wrote to the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly pleading that government should suspend the implementation of the excise duties on non-alcoholic, carbonated and sugary drinks.\n\nThe Congress provided a number of very cogent reasons why government should not go ahead with the decision to impose fresh taxes on soft drinks. One of the reasons we advanced was that the re-introduction of excise duties on non-alcoholic, carbonated and sugary drinks will impose immense hardship on ordinary Nigerians who easily keep hunger at bay with a bottle of soft drink and maybe a loaf of bread.\n\nOur concern is the mass hunger that would result from the slightest increase in the retail price of soft drinks owing to imposition of excise duties as it would be priced beyond the reach of many Nigerians. Congress was also alerted by the complaint of manufacturers of soft drinks in Nigeria that the re-introduction of excise duties would lead to very sharp decline in sales, forced reduction in production capacity, and a certain roll back in investments with the certainty of job losses and possibly shut down of manufacturing plants.\n\nNigerians would recall that this was also the complaint of tyre manufacturing companies such as Dunlop and Michelin which was overlooked by government until the two companies relocated to neighbouring Ghana. A similar situation is playing out with the soft drinks manufacturing sub-sector. Government should pay attention.\n\nWith 38% of the entire manufacturing output in Nigeria and 22.5% share representation of the entire manufacturing sector in Nigeria, the food and beverage industry is the largest industrial sub sector in our country. The food and beverage sub-sector has generated to the coffers of government N202 billion as VAT in the past five years, N7.3 billion as Corporate Social Responsibility and has created 1.5 million decent jobs both directly and indirectly.\n\nThere is thus no gainsaying the fact that the industry is a golden goose that must be kept alive. The health reason proffered by government as reason for the reintroduction of the excise duties seems altruistic. Yet, we are amiss why the government did not place the excise duties on sugar itself as a commodity rather than on carbonated drinks.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that an additional increase in the retail price of carbonated drinks would put more Nigerians at risk of serious health challenges as many people would resort to consuming sub-standard and unhygienic drinks as substitutes for carbonated drinks.\n\nThe appeal to rescind the re-introduction of excise duties on non-alcoholic drinks becomes even more compelling when the projected immediate revenue expected from the policy is weighed against the potential long-term loss to both manufacturers and government. The beverage sub-sector will lose 40% of its current sales revenue.\n\nThis translates to a loss of N1.9 trillion. While the government will only make total projected receipts of N81 billion from the proposed reintroduction of the excise duties. Government also stands to will lose N197 billion in VAT, Company Income Tax and Tertiary Education Tax as a consequence of expected downturn in overall industry performance should the excise duties be effected as being planned.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, we ask the National Assembly to quickly amend the sections of the Finance Act that re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks. We also ask government to extend COVID-19 palliatives and support incentives to the Food and Beverages industry to cushion the shock and haemorrhage that the industry is trying to recover from.\n\nFinally, we demand that Government should engage Employers in the subsector and Organized Labour in sincere discussions on other options that can deliver a mutually satisfying win-win solution to this issue. We hope that the current situation will not be allowed to degenerate into a breakdown in industrial relations in the sector and generally in the country.\n\nComrade Ayuba Wabba, mni\n\nPresident\n\nJanuary 2022",
          "summary": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is rejecting plans by the Federal Government to increase taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\nThe NLC, therefore, asked the National Assembly to urgently amend the sections of the Finance Act which re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\nSome of the provisions of the Finance Act includes the imposition of excise duties on locally produced non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sugary drinks.\nA similar situation is playing out with the soft drinks manufacturing sub-sector.\nThe truth of the matter is that an additional increase in the retail price of carbonated drinks would put more Nigerians at risk of serious health challenges as many people would resort to consuming sub-standard and unhygienic drinks as substitutes for carbonated drinks.",

Egbon Lekan Balogun is the most senior in our line and so he is the next in line to the throne.\n\n\u201cFor those asking, my \u2018body and mouth language\u2019 is that Egbon Lekan is my senior and he is next in line to the Olubadan stool.\n\n\u201cI do not have the powers to make anybody Olubadan. In 2017, we instituted a case to challenge the needless reform that Abiola Ajimobi as governor wanted to do. Almost all of us as High Chiefs and members of the Olubadan-in-Council agreed to the filing of a suit to challenge him and we gave the task to Michael Lana.\n\nLana later called me to say some of the High Chiefs told him to remove their names from the suit, leaving only my Egbon Balogun and myself.\n\nTwo weeks after we started the case, Egbon Balogun said he was no longer interested in the case. I asked Lana if I could do it alone and he told he \u2018yes\u2019 and we continued.\n\n\u201cBy the time, there had been a new government headed by Seyi Makinde who said he did not want the distraction of the suit and called for out-of court settlement which we agreed to and did.\n\n\u201cAfter the terms of settlement were agreed to, the court gave a consent judgment based on the terms. But they said they were not happy and instituted two fresh cases which are still in court till today.\n\n\u201cSo, I need people to understand that I am not causing any trouble. The cases that are in court today in respect of the Obaship tussle were instituted by Egbo Balogun and his colleagues who are still calling themselves Obas.\n\n\u201cIt is they that the people should talk to. Let them go and withdraw the cases they instituted. I don\u2019t like the unwarranted tension this matter is generating.\n\nLadoja is the second most senior chief in the Civil Line that is to produce the next Olubadan of Ibadan, following the death of Oba Saliu Adetunji.",

          "text": "Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, once turned down the role of Othello because he did not want to be typecast as a black actor.\n\nIt underlined the dilemma faced by a man who broke down many of Hollywood\u2019s racial barriers.\n\nAs the first black winner of the Academy Awards\u2019 Best Actor statuette, he was always aware of being the standard-bearer for greater racial integration.\n\nBut often he felt he had become something of a racial token, and this denied him the opportunity of taking on more varied roles.\n\nHe died on Friday, aged 94, the Bahamian foreign minister announced.\n\nSidney Poitier was born on 20 February 1927 in Miami, Florida.\n\nHis parents were Bahamian farmers who had travelled to the US to sell tomatoes. His premature birth meant he gained US citizenship as well as Bahamian.\n\nRelatives believed his father\u2019s family originated in Haiti and that his ancestors were runaway slaves.\n\nHe was brought up on Cat Island in the Bahamas before the family moved to the capital, Nassau.\n\nAged 15 he went to live with his brother in Miami before moving to New York, where he worked as a dishwasher.\n\nIt was in the US that he experienced racism for the first time.\n\n\u201cI lived in a country where I couldn\u2019t get a job, except those put aside for my colour or my caste.\u201d\n\nAfter a spell in the US Army he joined the American Negro Theatre, which had been set up as a community project in Harlem in 1940.\n\nDifficult\n\nUnfortunately Poitier was tone-deaf and was unable to sing, something audiences felt was a prerequisite of black actors at that time.\n\nInstead he decided his future lay as a serious stage actor and he was offered a leading role in a production of Aristophanes\u2019 comedy Lysistrata in 1946.\n\nIt was a sign of the times that the production featured only black actors.\n\nIn 1949 he took the difficult decision to move away from stage productions and into films.\n\nIt was a sound decision. His performance in the 1950 film No Way Out, in which he played a newly-qualified doctor confronted by a racist patient, brought him to the attention of the studios.\n\nHis breakthrough came in The Blackboard Jungle in 1955, in the role of a disruptive pupil in an inner-city school.\n\nThe film was immensely popular, not least because it was one of the first to have a soundtrack featuring rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, including Bill Haley\u2019s classic Rock Around the Clock.\n\nBrotherhood\n\nThe Defiant Ones, in 1958, saw Poitier nominated for best actor at the Academy Awards, and he won a Bafta for the same film.\n\nFive years later he was awarded an Oscar for Lilies of the Field, the first black winner of the Best Actor trophy.\n\nWith the growing civil rights movement in the US, it was inevitable Poitier would find himself lauded as an example of black achievement. It was a role he gladly accepted.\n\n\u201cI was a pretty good actor and I believed in brotherhood. I hated racism and segregation. And I was a symbol against those things.\u201d\n\nHowever, he was concerned that his Oscar may have been indicative of Hollywood\u2019s need for a token black actor, rather than something he achieved on merit.\n\nThen 1967 saw him at his commercial peak with three films, making him Hollywood\u2019s most bankable star that year.\n\nHe played a newly-qualified teacher in a tough London school in To Sir, With Love, based on the autobiographical novel by E R Braithwaite.\n\nStranded\n\nHis character\u2019s experience of being an immigrant in London mirrored that of many West Indians who came to Britain during the 1950s and \u201960s.\n\n\u201cActing isn\u2019t a game of \u2018pretend\u2019,\u201d he once said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exercise in being real.\u201d\n\nPoitier was nominated for Bafta and Golden Globe awards for Norman Jewison\u2019s film In the Heat of the Night.\n\nHe played a Philadelphia detective who found himself stranded in a red-necked Mississippi town on the night a businessman is murdered.\n\nHis developing relationship with the bigoted local sheriff, played by Rod Steiger, gave Poitier his strongest role and the film won five Oscars, including best picture.\n\nPoitier\u2019s response to Steiger\u2019s question \u201cWhat do they call you, boy?\u201d produced one of cinema\u2019s most famous lines: \u201cThey call me Mr Tibbs.\u201d\n\nGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner featured Poitier as the boyfriend of a white, middle-class girl who takes him to meet her parents.\n\nCampaign\n\nPlayed by Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn, her parents were torn between their liberal values and their reaction to a prospective black son-in-law.\n\nAt the time filming began, interracial marriage was still illegal in 17 US states. These laws were only revoked by the Supreme Court months before the film was released.\n\nBut Poitier faced criticism from some black civil-rights activists who complained his characters were just too good to be true.\n\nIt helped to persuade him to move away from acting roles. He involved himself in the campaign for Bahamian independence, achieved in 1973, and began a new career as a director.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, Poitier had formed his own production company with other stars, including Paul Newman and Barbra Streisand.\n\nSuccesses behind the camera included Stir Crazy, with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, and the thrillers Shoot to Kill and Little Nikita.\n\nPoitier became the first black actor to receive a life achievement award from the American Film Institute in 1992.\n\nFive years later, he was appointed the Bahamas\u2019 ambassador to Japan and he received a knighthood in 1974.\n\nAs a Bahamian citizen this was a substantive rather than an honorary award, although he did not use it in the US.\n\nPoitier married Juanita Hardy in 1950, but the union ended in 1965. In 1976 he married the Canadian actress, Joanna Shimkus, and had six daughters from his two marriages. His daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier is also an actress.\n\nIn 2016 He was awarded a Fellowship by Bafta, a recognition of his outstanding contribution to cinema. Poor health prevented him travelling to London to receive the award so he appeared via a video link.\n\nPoitier\u2019s noted ability to play intelligent leading roles helped to break down racial taboos in American cinema and wider society, although he played down his importance as a role model.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m remembered for having done a few good things,\u201d he once said, \u201cand if my presence here has sparked some good energies, that\u2019s plenty.\u201d",

          "title": "Kazakh President Gives Shoot-to-Kill Order to Quell Protests",
          "text": "Security forces appeared to have reclaimed the streets of Kazakhstan\u2019s main city on Friday after days of violence, and the Russian-backed president said he had ordered his troops to shoot to kill to put down a countrywide uprising.\n\nA day after Moscow sent paratroopers to help crush the insurrection, police were patrolling the debris-strewn streets of Almaty, although some gunfire could still be heard.\n\nDozens have died and public buildings across Kazakhstan have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence in its 30 years ofindependence.\n\nPresident Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said foreign-trained terrorists were responsible for the unrest.\n\n\u201cThe militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them,\u201d he said in a televised address.\n\n\u201cWhoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning.\u201d\n\nMoscow said more than 70 planes were ferrying Russian troops into Kazakhstan, and that these were now helping control Almaty\u2019s main airport, recaptured on Thursday from protesters.\n\nDemonstrations that began as a response to a fuel price hike have swelled into a broad movement against the government and ex-leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, the longest-serving ruler of any former Soviet state.\n\nHe turned over the presidency to Tokayev three years ago but his family is widely believed to have retained influence in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital that bears his name.\n\nSCARED\n\nThe protesters in Almaty appear mainly to come from the city\u2019s poor outskirts or surrounding towns and villages. The violence has come as a shock to urban Kazakhs, used to comparingtheir country favourably to more repressive and volatile ex-Soviet Central Asian neighbours.\n\n\u201cAt night when we hear explosions, I am scared,\u201d a woman named Kuralai told Reuters. \u201cIt hurts to know that young people are dying. This has clearly been planned \u2026 probably our government has relaxed somewhat.\u201d\n\nIn a state where scant political opposition is tolerated, no high-profile leaders of the protest movement have emerged to issue any formal demands.\n\nOne man who attended the first night of demonstrations and did not want to be identified said most of those who initially turned up were there to \u201cexpress solidarity spontaneously\u201d, before 100-200 \u201caggressive youths\u201d started hurling rocks at police.\n\nHe said he had expected some opposition politicians to formulate demands, but in vain.\n\nMukhtar Ablyazov, an exiled former banker and cabinet minister turned opponent of the government, said the West must counter Russia\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cIf not, then Kazakhstan will turn into Belarus and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will methodically impose his programme \u2013 the recreation of a structure like the Soviet Union,\u201d Ablyazov told Reuters from Paris.\n\nThe interior ministry said 26 \u201carmed criminals\u201d had been \u201cliquidated\u201d, while 18 police and members of the national guard had been killed, figures that appeared not to have been updated since Thursday. State television reported more than 3,700 arrests.\n\nOn Friday, fresh gunfire could be heard near the main square in Almaty, where troops had fought protesters throughout Thursday. Armoured personnel carriers and troops occupied the square.\n\nA few hundred metres away, a dead body lay in a wrecked civilian car. In another part of the city, an ammunition shop had been ransacked.\n\nUnrest has been reported in other cities, but the internet has been shut off since Wednesday, making it difficult to determine the extent of the violence.\n\nRUSSIAN INFLUENCE\n\nMoscow\u2019s swift deployment demonstrated Putin\u2019s readiness to use force to maintain influence in the former Soviet Union, at a time when he has also alarmed the West by massing troops near Ukraine, whose Crimean peninsula Russia seized in 2014.\n\nThe mission falls under the umbrella of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, comprising Russia and five ex-Soviet allies. Moscow said its force would number about 2,500.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow was \u201cdoing as allies should\u201d.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Washington was watching Russia\u2019s troops for any \u201cactions that may lay the predicate for the seizure of Kazakh institutions\u201d.\n\nTokayev\u2019s administration said the Russians had not been engaged in combat or the \u201celimination of militants\u201d.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s other major neighbour, China, has backed Tokayev. State television said President Xi Jinping had told him Beijing opposed any use of force to destabilise Kazakhstan.\n\nNazarbayev, who was the last Soviet-era Communist Party boss still ruling an ex-Soviet state when he passed the presidency to Tokayev in 2019, has not been seen or heard since the protests began.\n\nTokayev removing Nazarbayev and his nephew from security posts on Wednesday.\n\nThe apparent return of calm to Almaty helped Kazakhstan\u2019s bonds to recoup some of the ground they had lost on the turmoil.\n\nKazakhstan is a major oil producer and the world\u2019s top miner of uranium, and the unrest has affected global commodity prices.\n\nOil output at its top field, Tengiz, was reduced on Thursday, the field\u2019s operator Chevron (CVX.N) said, as some contractors disrupted train lines in support of the protests. read more\n\nKazakhstan also accounts for close to a fifth of global bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d, the power-intensive process of recording cryptocurrency transactions, and Kazakhstan\u2019s internet shutdown has curtailed the computing power of bitcoin\u2019s global network.",
