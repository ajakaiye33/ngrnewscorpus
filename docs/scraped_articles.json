          "text": "\u2026urges NASS to override Buhari or expunge direct primaries\n\nBy Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nDELTA State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu has urged the National Assembly to remove the contentious direct primaries from the new electoral reforms in the proposed law or override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the Bill to enable Nigerians to benefit from the new electoral reforms.\n\nAniagwu who spoke on African Independent Television, AIT, a live programme monitored by our Correspondent on Tuesday evening, told Nigerians to prevail on the National Assembly on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nHe said Nigerians should not dissipate energy debating on the propriety or otherwise of the President\u2019s refusal to assent to the Bill but channel the energy to call on the National Assembly to either override the President\u2019s veto or amend the Bill quickly and send it back to the President for his assent.\n\nAccording to Aniagwu, beyond the issue of funds mentioned by the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, we also have the challenge of data.\n\nAniagwu said: \u201cFrom the way we operate at the moment, it is possible for somebody to vote in Ekiti state and also move to Osun to vote in the direct primaries because the data is not there as it should.\n\n\u201cSo if indeed we need to have direct primaries which am not against, we need to first of all clean up the system. We need to enact the law to ensure that it addresses the issues of manipulations\u201d.\n\nWhile recalling that the President refused to assent to the amendment in 2018 on the guise that it was too close to the 2019 general election, he told the National Assembly to remove the grey arrears and send them back to the President to enable the country to have an electoral law that could address certain issues particularly the online transmission of results which is more important to Nigerians.\n\nHear him: \u201cI believe that once this is done we will begin to make some progress but if we continue to debate as to the propriety or otherwise of the President\u2019s refusal to give assent to the Bill, we will be doing so at the country\u2019s peril.\n\n\u201cWe need to get this done so that we can have an electoral act that is grounded in transparency\u201d, adding that; \u201cNigerians should not go low with those who don\u2019t want the country to have a credible electoral process\u201d.\n\nHe commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC for the introduction of the Bimodal Voters Verification and Accreditation System (BVAS) which, according to him, had reduced thuggery, violence, ballot box snatching among other rigging practices.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe law is very clear if the President decides to veto a bill sent to him by the National Assembly after 30days NASS is free to recall that Bill and override his veto.\n\n\u201cBut because we know that this National Assembly does not have the guts and the ball to even attempt to override the President\u2019s veto, the best thing we can do is to urge the National Assembly to take back the Bill and expunge the aspect of direct primaries that is the problem at the moment so that the President can assent to that Bill that will enable us to have electronic transmission of results.\n\n\u201cOnce we are able to do that we can still come back perhaps after this administration has left to begin to think of how we can indeed define the electoral process such that we could have direct primaries\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nOrganised Labour has pleaded with the Federal Government to find solutions to crisis in the research institutes and end the over 11-week industrial unrest in the sector.\n\nSpecifically, it wants the Minister of Labour and Employment, the Conciliator-in-Chief of the Federation, Senator Chris Ngige, to do the needful by engaging the unions, currently on strike, with a view to getting the dispute resolved amicably.\n\nUnder the aegis of the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions, NASU, Labour also decried the poor funding and neglect of public libraries by state governments.\n\nSpeaking to Vanguard, President of NASU, Dr. Makolo Hassan, lamented that \u201cthe research institutes\u2019 sector is not immune to the industrial relations crisis in the public sector. As we speak, it is now about 11 weeks since the Federal Government foisted a strike on the workers of the sector, under the Joint Research and Allied Institutions Sector Unions, JORAISU.\n\n\u201cThe strike started after two different statutory notices of 15 days each were served on the Federal Government, without any reaction or communication on same to the unions.\n\n\u201cThe issues in dispute are woven around the Federal Government\u2019s reluctance or refusal to honour and implement the Collective Bargaining Agreement it freely entered with JORAISU.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore appealing to the Federal Government, particularly the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development; Minister of Science and Technology; Minister of Environment and other Supervisory Ministries of Research Institutes and other Agencies, whose staff are affected as well as the Minister of Labour and Employment, the Conciliator-in-Chief of the Federation, to do the needful by engaging the Unions currently on strike with a view to getting the dispute resolved amicably.\u201d\n\nDr Hassan also berated state governments for poor funding and total neglect of public libraries, saying \u201cLibraries are portals to the world\u2019s knowledge. It is because of the importance of libraries that wealthy individuals invest in private libraries. Public libraries offer services and products that level the intellectual playing fields.\n\nThat is, they allow people of any income level or background to access high-quality information, to use computers or borrow books they need, which they cannot afford to buy or are not easily available to purchase. Moreover, public libraries provide a conducive environment for reading.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, State governments have neglected public libraries in the states through lack of adequate funding. Structures housing State Library Boards and reading rooms are in a terrible state of dilapidation. Welfare of staff of State libraries have been relegated to the background as salaries are left unpaid for months; some of the staff are yet to enjoy the new National Minimum Wage of N30,000.00 a month, while some libraries do not have a single vehicle, etc.\n\n\u201cWe call on state governments to wake up to their responsibilities by improving the funding of their libraries, including looking into the welfare of the staff. The Federal Government should also prevail on the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, to complete the National Library of Nigeria permanent site.\u201d currently under construction.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Onyekachi Nwebonyi, Wednesday stated that Ndigbo must connect to the politics at the Centre to be able to realize their aspiration of producing the next Nigerian President of Igbo extraction.\n\nNwebonyi who is the Commissioner for Abakaliki Capital City Development Authority added that \u201cas Igbo, we should see a reason to connect to the party at the centre because as a minority in Nigeria we cannot afford to play opposition politics.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner stated this at Mbeke in Ishieke community of Ebonyi Local Government Area of the State while dolling out empowerment items to indigent youths, widows and other less privileged members of the community.\n\nThe Ebonyi Commissioner who further added that Governor David Umahi was suitably qualified to run for the position of the President added that the Governor would bring about infrastructural development of the country if given the opportunity.\n\nNwebonyi who is also a Chieftain of the All Progressive Congress, APC awarded university scholarships to 50 students from Mbeke, Ishieke Community, gave out motorcycles to indigent youths and a Toyota Corolla to the Chairman of APC in Ebonyi LGA of the State.\n\nWhile presenting cheques and empowerment items to the beneficiaries, Nwebonyi urged them to make judicious use of the items given to them to enhance their economic status.\n\nHe advised the beneficiaries of the scholarship grants to shun illicit activities that could derail their academic programmes and admonished them to study hard to make good academic grades.\n\n\u201cI want to advise beneficiaries to make judicious use of every opportunity that I have provided for them. The students that I have given scholarships should study hard to bring hope to their families while those that I have given motorcycles should make good use of them.\n\n\u201cI can recall that somebody that I gave one motorcycle last year now has two showing that the empowerment is yielding good result,\u201d Nwebonyi said.\n\nNwebonyi further noted that he was spurred to embark on the empowerment programme in order to reduce the poverty level and the rate of criminality in the community.\n\n\u201cBefore now, there is a high level of criminality in this area occasioned by poverty. But, I discovered that there is a gap between the leaders and the led particularly the youths who are idle.\n\n\u201cSo, as a leader, I felt that we should make provisions for other people\u2019s children; we just can\u2019t be providing for our own children because our children are not safe if the other children are not properly engaged.\n\n\u201cThat is the essence of what I do annually. Since 2016 I became the state chairman of a party and now as Commissioner, with what I have given today; I have given a total of 484 motorcycles, I have built houses for 37 families and a Toyota Corolla car.\n\n\u201cI have produced more than 20 graduates under our scholarship scheme with 30 students still pursuing various academic degree programmes in different Nigerian universities. This is a way of appreciating God and also in keeping with the philosophy of our master, Gov Umahi,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Anselem Iziuogo and Miss Nkiruka Ogbaga on behalf of the beneficiaries thanked the benefactor for the gesture saying that the scholarship grant has assisted students from the area in their academic programme.\n\nVanguard gathered that some of the beneficiaries received N100,000 while others got N50,000 as scholarships grants.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Elusive nation Nigeria: Christmas celebration by Shiite in Zaria commendable",
          "text": "By Afe Babalola\n\nTHE amalgamation of the hundreds of scattered ethno-political groups across the geographical plane now known as Nigeria has always come at a cost \u2013 the separation of the people across ethnic and religious divides. Consequently, people from a particular geo-political or religious affiliation tend to express nepotic bias towards other members of the group and, therefore, the concept of one Nigeria has usually been relegated to the realm of fantasy.\n\nIt has been observed, however, that the only notable exception, that is where Nigerians tend to be unanimous, is when the country participates in regional or international football competitions. In such times, the Igbo man would easily welcome his Hausa neighbour to share moments of sporting bliss.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:Christmas: Reps\u2019 minority caucus not happy Nigerians can\u2019t afford basic needs of life\n\nNigeria\u2019s inherent ethno-cultural divides climaxed into the civil war which further drove the nation apart. Though the impact of the civil war is still being felt, particularly in unspoken hostilities among peoples from different tribes, there is largely peaceful co-existence. This, perhaps, has accounted for seemingly rare moments of immense show of camaraderie between people with differing religious, political and ethnic affiliations.\n\nRecently, during the celebration of Christmas at a church in Zaria, Kaduna State, members of the renowned Shiite group attended and fellowshipped with Christians, and also presented gifts as a sign of love and solidarity. Commenting on the rationale behind the unprecedented visit by the group, the leader of the team reportedly noted that:\n\n\u201cWe decided to attend this church service today because today is Christmas Day, a day that the birth of Jesus Christ is being celebrated over the globe and we feel that we also have our concern to share with them the feelings of the day Jesus was born.\n\n\u201cThe coming of Jesus to this world is a blessing to everybody, so we wish that we should come and celebrate this glorious day with them. As they (Christians) attach importance to this day so also we attach so much importance to the day and that is why we came today to clear all the unnecessary imaginary boundaries that have been created between Muslims and Christians. This is important now that the country is facing multiple security challenges that require all hands to be on deck in other to overcome them\u201d.\n\nIt is indeed true that there have been imaginary boundaries between Muslims and Christians, much so that adherents of both religions do not usually find a common ground. This, therefore, accounts for the nationwide celebration of such rare occasions when a person defies ethnic or religious divides to save or rescue members of the other tribe or religion, even at a risk to his own life.\n\nSuch was the case Imam Abubakar Abdullahi, an 83-year-old Muslim cleric who saved hundreds of Christians who fled attacks from Muslim herdsmen who had launched coordinated attacks on Christian farmers in 10 villages in the Barkin Ladi Area of Plateau State on June 23, 2018.\n\nAccording to a CNN report, the imam gave refuge to his Christian neighbours, sheltering 262 Christians in his mosque and his home, then stood outside the doors confronting the Muslim attackers, pleading with them to spare the lives of the Christians inside, even offering to exchange his own life for theirs.\n\nIn appreciation of this brazen act of bravery, the US government, therefore, honoured the cleric with the 2019 International Religious Freedom Award.\n\nSimilarly, it was reported that a Fulani Muslim rescued two Christian missionaries who were dumped in the bush by kidnappers after two months in captivity. After rescuing the missionaries, he reportedly took care of them for two days before taking them to their church leaders in Gusau, Zamfara State.\n\nThere is hope for the nation\n\nThe inherent challenges in nation-building from multiple ethnic groups is one which most African nations such as Nigeria face today. Admittedly, Nigeria is a complex, multi-lingual, and heterogenous society with behaviour and relationships of individuals and groups being determined by cultural affiliations and social institutions. According to sociologists, different people are predisposed to conceptualise political and economic resources and the access to them in divergent ways through their own coded lenses. Despite these ethno-social and religious divides, Nigerians have, over time, demonstrated the capability to be united, at least in matters which involve the overall welfare of the citizenry such as security.\n\nThere is no doubt that the nation is plagued by a myriad of security challenges which has affected virtually every region. The news media is constantly awash with reports of kidnappings of Christians and Muslims, Northerners and Southerners. If there is one thing that Nigerians agree on, it is the spate of insecurity.\n\nHaving recognised this, it is important, among others, for government to put in place mechanism for legislative and constitutional reviews or overhaul to improve on the policy and institutional means of dealing with security concerns that has plagued the country.\n\nThe federal, state and local governments must bring about programmes relating to cultural and political orientation that seek to enthrone the fundamentals of sustainable democracy. Democracy must be maintained in the face of growing security threats. While most Nigerians are unanimous as to the concern of insecurity, it yet remains for the political stakeholders to make comprehensive contributions in order to tackle the problem and boost the confidence of the dying masses in government\u2019s resolve to end insecurity.\n\nAs already demonstrated, the capacity of Nigerians to live in unity is one which is not unrealistic. However, for sustenance of this state of affairs, there must be proportional representation which allows for the effective representation of the minorities at the local, state and national levels. There must be a demonstrable commitment to fair and equitable development, as well as the recognition and acceptance of the fact that each group, whether in the majority or minority, is entitled to a measure of self-determination within the national framework.\n\nIt has been remarked that a national policy which ensures that no group shall be denied its rights and entitlements, must be formulated.\n\nIt must be noted that the denial of a certain group of the dividend of its resources always leads to frustration and inability to identify with the nation state \u2013 the people of the Niger Delta as case in point. There must be a framework to support dialogue among all groups.\n\nThough government has, in times past, made attempts to manage the ethnic diversity in the nation, such as prohibition of ethnic political parties, adoption of the federal character principle, federalism, among others, there is clearly more to be done in order to create an atmosphere of unity for Nigerians; where everyone is made to feel relevant.\n\nWhile the idea of living in a unified Nigeria is, in reality, not a fa\u00e7ade, it is yet possible given a conducive environment to foster same.\n\nBut until then, the status quo remains and Nigerians may continue to experience the isolated events of brotherliness.",

The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain had on Monday said the operatives threatened to blow off his head if he resisted arrest.\n\nNwosu was arrested during an outing service in honour of his late mother, Jemamah Nwosu, at St. Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe incident led to a verbal altercation between the Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, and the Imo State Government.\n\nNwosu, who is Okorocha\u2019s son-in-law, said that at the Tactical Squad Office, Abuja where he was taken to, he was informed that someone alleged in a petition he was an arms supplier to militants.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey accused me of sponsoring insecurity in Imo state. I want to thank the IGP who intervened and ordered my release,\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to IGP to look into the activities of the police personnel in Imo State because what happened was because it is Uche Nwosu, what about those that are not Uche Nwosu. I am not talking about me what about other Imo youths who have nobody to speak for them.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the IGP to look into this. The IGP is a good person because, without him, something else would have happened to me.\n\n\u201cI was taken to the Tactical Squad Office, Abuja where I was told that someone wrote a petition against me alleging that I supply arms to militants.\u201d\n\nThe former AA governorship candidate said the whole drama was done to humiliate and malign his image.\n\nFurther narrating his experience, he said: \u201cOver 15 masked security operatives jumped into the church. While some rushed to the altar, some came to where I was sitting and ordered me to move or move me. They started shooting and disrupted the sermon that was ongoing. I demanded to know what was going on but they said they had an instruction to bring me.\n\n\u201cThey manhandled me and bundled me into one of the vehicles they came in. One of them ordered me to lie down and one of them placed his leg on my head.\n\n\u201cWhen they drove off, they started making calls in the Hausa Language, and unknown to them, I understand the Hausa Language. They were telling one Shaba who is the chief security officer that they have got me.\n\n\u201cAt Umuaka, they stopped and ordered that I should get down. At that point, I thought they were to assassinate me. They bundled me into another vehicle and they drove off.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Owerri, three other vehicles drove straight to the government house and the one carrying me drove towards Okigwe Road and I began to ask them where they were taking me to but they never responded to me. They drove towards Okigwe and stopped.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I thought they wanted to assassinate me. They asked me to remove my clothes, handcuffed me, snapped me, made a video, and sent it to the CSO.\n\n\u201cWe continued until we got to Enugu airport where we boarded a charted jet to Abuja. We moved to Force Headquarters and we did an interview. They accused me of sponsoring insecurity in Imo State.\u201d\n\nHe however said that what happened cannot deter him from being who he is or cause him to run away from Imo State.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid and can never be afraid to enter my state. So what happened cannot stop me from entering my state, I am now more courageous because God has delivered me from their hands. If I want to die it is better to die in my state than outside the state. So I am not afraid,\u201d Nwosu added.\n\nLike Nwosu, Okorocha called for an investigation of the Sunday incident, which he said was neither ordered by the state police command nor the Force Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe however believes that the arrest would pave the way for the unmasking of unknown gunmen who have killed many persons in the state.\n\nOkorocha spoke on Politics Today, a Channels Television live programme monitored by The Nation.\n\nLamenting the manner in which Nwosu was arrested, the former governor raised the alarm that Imo State was fast sliding into Banana Republic where people now live in fear.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Imo state is really unfortunate and the state is becoming a banana republic and everybody appears to be living in fear. What happened to Uche Nwosu is an aberration and should never happen under our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nOkorocha insisted that those that perpetrated the act were from the Imo State Government House.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s something that has to be unraveled in Imo State and that is unknown gunmen in the state and it appears these men are now getting to be known. And I task the IGP to tell the world the truth on this matter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left for the police and Imo Government Government to unmask who ordered the arrest, paid for a private jet, and directed that Uche be humiliated but the truth will come out \u201d\n\nHowever, the state government yesterday maintained that it has no hand in Nwosu\u2019s ordeal.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba described his allegation as spurious and baseless.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Imo State Government has been drawn to a spurious and baseless allegation by Uche Nwosu who was recently arrested by the police, for a yet to be disclosed crime, that the state government was behind his arrest. This is a malicious concoction, that can only be made up by a drowning man,\u201d Emelumba said in a statement.\n\nHe emphasised that the administration of Hope Uzodimma did not believe in tyranny or lawlessness.\n\n\u201cIt should be emphasized that the government of Senator Hope Uzodimma does not believe in tyranny or lawless behavior as was in the case when Uche Nwosu was the de facto deputy governor of the state,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said that the arrest of Nwosu was another vindication that it had no hand in the attacks and kidnappings in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThis is another vindication that IPOB and Eastern Security Network (ESN) are not responsible for the numerous attacks, abductions/kidnappings in Imo State contrary to false accusations and propaganda by Hope Uzodinma and his co-travelers,\u201d IPOB said in a statement by its Spokesman, Emma Powerful.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State has however apologised to the Anglican Church over the invasion of its parish by security operatives.\n\nCAN Chairman in the state, Rev. Eches Divine-Eches, tendered the apology on Monday while addressing reporters in Owerri.\n\nCondemning the action of the policemen, Divine-Eches asked security agencies to ensure they carried out their duty in a professional manner.",

I see it as an industry concert because it\u2019s not just us, it\u2019s a blend of all. So, I just feel like it\u2019s the industry concert not just P-Square because we did the concert with legends, people that were not even born when we started, It was an emotional rollercoaster for many.

          "title": "2021: Succession game ahead of next general elections",
          "text": "The succession games in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) shaped the polity in the outgoing year. High-profile defections, intra-party crises and the bid to amend the Electoral Act, 2021 accounted for the drama. Deputy Political Editor RAYMOND MORDI lists some of the main political events that made the headlines during the year\n\nTo a large extent, many of the events witnessed within the polity during the year 2021 have been shaped by the politics of the 2023 general elections. The era of President Muhammadu Buhari is gradually coming to an end and politics during the year was defined by the succession game within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and beyond. From defections, regional bipartisan collaboration, to landmark electoral reform bills at the National Assembly, the reasons behind many of the events or issues that shaped politics within the year is discernible to many Nigerians.\n\nYear of defections:\n\nWith the next general elections just around the corner, there has been a realignment of forces, as some politicians try to reposition themselves for the contest. The topsy-turvy nature of Nigerian politics makes it easy for politicians across the political divide to move from one political party to another without qualms and legal encumbrances. The ruling party was a beneficiary of such defections during the year, particularly from the main opposition party, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP); as there have been some high-profile defections into the party. For instance, on January 28, seven lawmakers in Ogun State elected on the platform of the APM returned to the APC. They are Modupe Mujota who represents Abeokuta North State Constituency, Musefiu Lamidi of Ado-Odo/Ota II and Amosun Yusuf of Ewekoro State Constituency. The others are Ajayi Bolanle (Egbado South), Ganiyu Oyedeji (Ifo II), Ajibola Sikiratu (Ipokia/Idiroko) and Ademola Adeniran (Sagamu II).\n\nThe following are some of the high-profile defections in February: Senator Iyiola Omisore, a former deputy governor in Osun State defected from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the APC; Gbenga Daniel, a former governor of Ogun State and campaign manager for the PDP presidential candidate in the last general elections, Atiku Abubakar, from the opposition for the APC; Abiola Peters Makinde who represents Ondo East/West at the House of Representatives, from the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for APC;\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBlessing Onuh who represents Oturkpo/Ohimini Federal Constituency of Benue, from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the APC; Yakubu Abdullahi who represents Bauchi Federal Constituency, from the PDP to the APC; and Jemili Akingbade (former Minority Whip), Adegoke Adeyanju, and Wahab Haruna, the three lawmakers elected on the platform of the ADC in the Ogun State House of Assembly, to the APC.\n\nMarch was not an exception. During the month, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole left the PDP and pitched tent with the APC; a lawmaker representing the Egbado North/Imeko Afon Federal Constituency of Ogun State, Jimoh Aremu also defected from the ADC to the APC; while former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Azubike Ihejirika (rtd) formally joined the APC towards the end of the month. He was received into the party by Yobe State Governor and Chairman APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nIndeed, there were defections all through the year. For example, on May 20, Cross River State\u2019s Governor Ben Ayade officially joined the APC from the PDP. On Tuesday, June 29, Zamfara State\u2019s Governor Bello Matawalle also formally defected from the PDP to the APC. He was received into the party at a rally in Gasau, the state capital, attended by 11 APC governors, ministers, senators and members of the House of Representatives. Similarly, on August 27, Stella Oduah, a former Minister of Aviation, joined the APC, while former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode met President Buhari at the State House, Abuja on September 16, after he rejoined the ruling party. The former minister had been a fierce critic of the party.\n\nNarrow escape for Akeredolu:\n\nThe Supreme Court on July 28 upheld the election of Ondo State\u2019s Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. The court, in a split decision of four-to-three, dismissed the appeal brought by the candidate of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede on the October 10, 2020 governorship election. The majority judgment, which was read by Justice Emmanuel Agim, said it found no reason to set aside the concurrent judgments of the Court of Appeal and the Ondo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal which had dismissed Jegede\u2019s petition for lack of merit.\n\nBut, Justice Mary Odili, in a dissenting minority verdict, upheld Jegede\u2019s appeal that the nomination of Akeredolu, which was signed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, was not valid under Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution. The PDP candidate had challenged the APC primary election which produced Akeredolu, saying it violated Section 87 of the Electoral Act and Article 20 of the APC constitution and other relevant election guidelines.\n\nSome observers described it as a narrow escape for Governor Akeredolu, as four judges upheld his victory against the dissenting judgment of three other justices. They said the judgment is a warning to the APC to quickly sort out its leadership challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Akeredolu was sworn in for his second term in office, alongside his deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa at a ceremony held at the International Culture and Events Centre, Akure, the state capital. At the oath-taking ceremony, which took place on February 24, Akeredolu has promised to set the state on the path of inclusive and renewed growth. He also listed his achievements during his first term in office and promised not to depart from his \u2018redemptive and restorative\u2019 blueprint.\n\nPDP battles for relevance:\n\nThe year was a crucial one for members of the PDP. They had been seeking to rebuild the party to regain power during the next general elections. As part of the efforts to reposition the platform ahead of the election, members of the party\u2019s House of Representatives Caucus in early August had demanded the resignation of former National Chairman Uche Secondus.\n\nIn demanding Secondus\u2019s resignation, the House of Representatives Caucus observed that Secondus was not effective as leader of the opposition. At the end of the day, the development deepened the crisis that hit the PDP after the resignation of seven national officers on August 4.\n\nEventually, the party held a national convention on Saturday, October 31 where Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led NWC was elected to pilot the affairs of the party from this month. After the successful conduct of the convention, stakeholders said is an indication that the party has been returned to its founding fathers and that the former ruling PDP is more organized than the APC. Dr. Ayu has also assured that the party is back to rescue and rebuild Nigeria. Ayu spoke in Abuja recently when he and other members of the new NWC were being sworn in. He said that the newly inaugurated leadership will strengthen internal democratic processes.\n\nThe PDP has been trying to capitalize on the perceived incompetence of the ruling party; the opposition party says it is on a rescue mission to bring sanity back to the country.\n\nCrisis management in APC:\n\nThe Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC has been doing everything possible to prevent the crisis in various chapters from escalating. The committee was saddled with the task of bringing peace to the APC and organising a national convention that would produce another elected executive for the party within six months.\n\nToday, over 18 months after, the party\u2019s national convention has been postponed three times and there are a lot of challenges before the APC as it prepares for the long-awaited event, which is now scheduled to hold in February 2022. The Buni-led caretaker committee emerged in June 2020 after the dissolution of the Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee, following its dismissal last year through a court judgment.\n\nBuhari\u2019s changing attitude:\n\nPresident Buhari is known as a man who does not usually sack anyone working for him; many of the ministers and numerous aides who got appointments at the outset of his first term are still with him. But, on September 1, he relieved two ministers of their appointments. They are the Ministers of Agriculture, Mohammed Sabo Nanono and his Power counterpart, Saleh Mamman. Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity), Femi Adesina, who made the announcement, also indicated that the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abubakar had been redeployed to the Ministry of Agriculture, while the Minister of State for Works, Abubakar Aliyu is to take over as Minister of Power.\n\nWar over VAT:\n\nA controversy broke out in August between the Federal Government and some state governments over who should collect value-added tax (VAT); the goods and services tax levied on the price of a product or service at each stage of production, distribution or sale.\n\nThis came on the heels of an August 10 ruling of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, following Governor Nyesom Wike\u2019s resolve to approach the court to determine who should collect the tax between federal and state governments. Before the judgment, the right authority to collect VAT was hardly an issue, possibly because it was a sustained source of revenue that contributed significantly to government revenue at all levels.\n\nHowever, since the court ruled that the Rivers State Government, and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), should collect VAT, which implied that every state would collect VAT, the political landscape was inundated with arguments for and against the ruling. The FIRS has filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal in Abuja, and the court ordered that the parties should maintain the status quo. The Rivers State Government, which already enacted its VAT law, has also approached the Supreme Court to set aside the Appeal Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Government, which has also enacted its VAT law, has asked to be joined in the appeal. Meanwhile, the discourse has since shifted from an economic issue to the murky waters of politics before it was reduced to the usual inter-ethnic conflict between the North and South.\n\nDeteriorating insecurity:\n\nLike the years before it, 2021 is another year of failed promises, as far as security is concerned. The ruling APC has not been able to find a solution to the insecurity in various parts of the country. Insecurity continues to ravage many parts of the country; from a jihadist insurgency in the Northeast to attacks by criminal gangs carrying out mass kidnappings in the Northwest and separatists targeting security forces in the Southeast. President Buhari has been in the eye of the storm, as many observers continue to criticize his inability to stem the level of insecurity in the country under his watch. Despite repeated claims by the Buhari-led Federal Government about Boko Haram being \u2018defeated\u2019, \u2018technically defeated\u2019 or \u2018decimated\u2019 but revelations by some state governors prove otherwise.\n\nRevival of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum:\n\nThe impending general elections also spurred bipartisan regional collaboration among the 17 governors of southern states, with the revival of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum. A meeting of the governors was held in Asaba in May, to address some of the issues that may mar the next general elections, such as the open grazing of cattle. The southern governors, among other things, demanded the zoning of the presidential ticket of major political parties to the South. Follow up meetings were held in Lagos in July and Enugu in September.\n\nIt has been observed that resolving the political contradictions in the country sits at the bedrock of the nation\u2019s challenges. They also demanded a restructuring of the polity or devolution of powers, and possibly for the return of the country to the 1963 Republican Constitution. Aside from governors, other stakeholders appear to be in sync with the recent move for power-shift, the bid to transfer the responsibility of collecting the VAT and the opposition to open grazing.\n\nOnochie in eye of storm:\n\nThe nomination of President Buhari\u2019s Special Assistant on Social Media, Mrs. Lauretta Onochie to serve as an INEC commissioner caused quite a stir within the political circle. Members of the opposition and civil society activists launched an intensive campaign to prevail on the Senate to reject her nomination because it would be undemocratic for partisan individuals like Onochie to be made electoral umpires. Onochie is a card-carrying member of the ruling party. On July 13, the Senate eventually rejected the nomination, based on a report by its committee on INEC.\n\nThe committee, chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya, however, insisted that she was disqualified based on Federal Character principles. Senator Gaya said Onochie\u2019s nomination was rejected because there was a serving INEC commissioner representing Delta State. The insinuation was that Onochie would be nominated again when the tenure of Mrs. May Agbamuche-Mbu from Delta State as a National Commissioner representing the Southsouth expires. But, on December 14, President Buhari re-nominated Mrs Agbamuche-Mbu for a fresh term. This must-have dashed the hopes of Mrs Onochie of being re-nominated.\n\nAnambra governorship poll:\n\nAfter resolving the challenge posed by the deteriorating insecurity in the Southeast, the November 10 governorship election in Anambra State was eventually held, with a turnout of 10 per cent of registered voters. Charles Chukwuma Soludo of the APGA who polled 112,229 votes was declared the winner of the contest. His closest challenger was Valentine Ozigbo of the PDP who got 53,807 votes, while Andy Uba of the APC came third, with 43, 285 votes.\n\nBut, last week Monday (December 20), the Federal High Court in Abuja nullified Senator Uba\u2019s participation in the election. In the judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo held that Uba was never a candidate in the election because he emerged through an illegally conducted primary. Justice Ekwo said the plaintiff, George Moghalu succeeded in proving that the APC did not conduct a valid primary. The judge, therefore, ordered INEC to delete Uba from its record as a candidate in the election and ordered the APC to refund to Moghalu, the sum of N22.5 million, which is the amount he paid for expression of interest and nomination forms since the party failed to conduct a valid primary.\n\nDrama over #EndSARS report:\n\nThe release of the Lagos State #EndSARS panel\u2019s report on Monday, November 15, 2021, after one year of taking testimonies, receiving evidence and awarding compensations, generated controversy between those who welcomed with relief the outcome of the judicial inquiry into the October 20, 2020 shooting at the Lekki tollgate and those who contended that the report was fabricated to embarrass the government.\n\nThe eight-man panel of inquiry headed by retired Justice Doris Okuwobi had submitted a 309-page report in which it indicted soldiers and the police and affirmed that security agents killed peaceful protesters. Describing the Lekki tollgate incident as a massacre, the panel declared that at least nine persons were killed by security agents. It listed 48 names as casualties out of which 22 protesters sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and the police.\n\nBut, the Lagos State government, in a white paper on the report, rejected some of its conclusions, saying there were fundamental inconsistencies. For instance, the state\u2019s Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) said the panel\u2019s findings were contrary to the evidence provided and that the panel\u2019s report \u201ccreated doubts and gaps and did not explain how they arrived at that conclusion, the names, who shot them and when they were shot\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Government had also rejected the report. Information and Culture Minister, Lai Mohammed who made the government\u2019s position known during a press conference in Abuja described it as an equivalence of fake news because it was riddled with a lot of errors, inconsistencies and discrepancies. The minister contended that the report was \u201csocial media tales by the moonlight\u2019\u2019 and sheer waste of taxpayers money.\n\nAnother failed bid to amend Electoral Act:\n\nOne of the major bills that were passed by Senator Ahmed Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila-led 9th National Assembly this year was the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. After the delay and re-drafting of the bill, the document that was harmonized by both chambers of the National Assembly and passed in October was widely perceived as a historic opportunity to introduce unique electoral reforms to the polity. It was presented to President Buhari for assent on November 19.\n\nSome of the landmark provisions of the bill seek to resolve issues regarding the use of modern technologies in the electoral process. In the bill, the National Assembly made provision for the use of electronic voting and transmission of results from polling units, at the discretion of the electoral umpire, INEC. The lawmakers also mandated all political parties to use the direct primary as the only mode of election to select candidates to fly their flags at various levels.\n\nAfter keeping Nigerians in suspense within the 30-day window he has to sign or veto the bill, President Buhari declined assent, stating that the parties should be allowed to decide on their mode of primary. Reasons adduced by the president include the high cost of monitoring the primaries of various parties by INEC; marginalisation of small parties; possible litigation; security challenges of monitoring direct primaries, violation of rights of citizens; and possible manipulation of the primaries.\n\nThis is not the first time President Buhari would refuse to sign amendments to the Electoral Act. The Eighth National Assembly under the leadership of Senator Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara also made efforts to amend the Electoral Act before the last general elections. But, Buhari declined to assent to the bill three consecutive times, even after it was reworked to accommodate his recommendations.",

          "title": "Amaechi misleading Nigerians on money left behind by Jonathan \u2013Chidoka",
          "text": "Former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka, has rebuffed allegation by Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, that the money left behind by former president, Goodluck Jonathan, could not last the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for three weeks.\n\nAmaechi stated this when he featured on television\u2019s programme, \u2018Hard Copy\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs former chairman of the governors\u2019 forum, I was told by the security in a meeting chaired by the former president, including the former minister of finance, that at every point in time, the government must leave money behind in case Nigeria goes to war that would last for six months. By the time we came, they didn\u2019t leave money behind that could last us for three weeks. And I was speaking at that time as the chairman of the governors\u2019 forum,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nHowever, Chidoka, in a statement titled \u2018Gov. Amaechi\u2019s Statement on 2015 Foreign Reserve: Setting the Records Straight,\u2019 accused Amaechi of deliberately feeding Nigerians with lies to curry public favour for the Buhari administration even as he said the Jonathan administration handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) and a diversified economy to the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Federal Executive Council that handed over to the current administration, I am disturbed that this urban myth of \u2018empty treasury\u2019 is still the subject of conversation by a senior government member.\n\n\u201cAlso, I am confused about what the Honourable Minister means when he says, \u201cBy the time we came in,\u201d as he was not appointed minister until six months after the May 29 Handover. Since he was not a minister on the handover date, it may be pertinent to present him with the facts again.\n\n\u201cOn May 29, 2015, President Buhari inherited a foreign reserve of $28.6 billion, according to official data still present on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as $5.6 billion Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas Limited dividends. Also, a 2015 budget of over N4 trillion was handed over to the incoming administration by the outgoing Jonathan government.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Jonathan administration left a total of $2.2 billion in the Excess Crude Account on May 29, 2015. (As verified by the Ministry of Finance both by the immediate past minister and the incumbent).\n\n\u201cTo further create context, I would like the Minister of Transport to note the country\u2019s economic indices after 1849 days of President Jonathan\u2019s Presidency from May 06 2010, the date he took over from President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua to the Handover date of May 29, 2015.\n\n\u201cOn May 29, 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari inherited an economy that, by the testimony of the World Investment Report, prepared by the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), was the number one destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. In the five years of President Jonathan, Direct Foreign Investment stood at about 35.25 Billion Dollars. You can compare this to the 11.55 Billion Dollars Direct Foreign Investment received from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Jonathan administration handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) and a diversified economy. On May 29, 2015, President Jonathan left behind an economy with a stable currency, where the Naira exchanged for N199 to $1, and Nigeria had a single-digit inflation rate. Today, after 2,406 days of the current administration, headline inflation rate hovers above 15 per cent.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cUnder President Jonathan, the unemployment rate stood at 7.5 per cent (better than European Union) today. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, six and half years after Governor Amaechi\u2019s government came in, unemployment is 33 per cent.\n\n\u201cBefore the government came in, Nigeria\u2019s poverty rate was 32 per cent as of May 2015. We need not compare it against 71 per cent today after 78 months of President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cOur External debt as of May 2015 stood at $7.3 billion, the Gini coefficient (degree of inequality) was not different from China\u2019s as of 2015. In 343 weeks and four days of the current administration, our external debt has ballooned to $37.9 billion as of September 2021. It is important to point out that over 48 per cent are bilateral and commercial loans.\n\nWith the facts above, I am sure that the Minister of Transport will rethink his fixation on the past and focus on the clear and present danger of an economy on the path to Argentina \u2013 sovereign debt default.\n\n\u201cIn the face of declining revenues, available public data revealed that external debt servicing gulped $1.82 billion between January and September 2021; this is 43.9 per cent higher than the $1.27 billion spent in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the same period of January to September 2021, Domestic debt servicing rose to N1.74 trillion from N1.53 trillion recorded in the same period of 2020.\n\nThese issues should worry the Honourable Minister, coupled with unlocking the asphyxiating gridlock that Apapa port has created in the economy.\n\n\u201c2,406 days after, a clear 557 days (One year five months) more than President Jonathan governed Nigeria; this administration\u2019s economic policies and heightened insecurity have left the country comatose.\n\n\u201cMinister Amaechi and the APC government should stop this perennial blame game and focus on redeeming its tattered image by signing the electoral bill passed by a legislature it controls.\u201d",

          "text": "From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nFormer president, Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, knocked leader of the Ijaw nation, Chief Edwin Clark, over his recent claim that oil in the Niger Delta belongs to the region.\n\nHe said Clark\u2019s ownership claim amounted to having two sovereign entities within a state, which is impossible.\n\nThe leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum and chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress (INC), had in a letter titled, \u201cMy Disappointment Over Unprovoked Outburst Against The People of Niger Delta Region\u201d accused Obasanjo of resenting the people of the region.\n\nHis comments came after Obasanjo allegedly attacked Ebipamowei Wodu, national secretary of INC over resource control at a recent peace meeting.\n\nClark said section 140 of the 1963 constitution provided that a natural resource found in a region is to be controlled by the people of the area.\n\nHowever, Obasanjo said the provision did not imply that resources found in any region belongs to the people there.\n\n\u201cMy dear chief, where in this constitutional provision is it said or implied that minerals located in any part of Nigeria belongs to that location? For emphasis and to further buttress the point, the provision is even in the Exclusive List \u2013 exclusively reserved to the Federal Government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former president said it was wrong and unconstitutional for Clark and the people of Niger Delta to lay claim to crude oil or any mineral resources, saying, \u201cno territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\u201d\n\nHe expressed disappointment over Clark\u2019s deployment of \u201coffensive and uncouth\u201d languages which according to him are unbecoming of a leader of Clark\u2019s status to describe him.\n\nThe former president declared that Nigeria and Niger Delta demand in Clark, a statesman and not a tribesman, just as he cautioned the Ijaw nation leader against deploying \u201coffensive and uncouth languages\u201d to describe his personality.\n\n\u201cSome of the languages you (Clark) have deployed to describe me in your letter are offensive, uncouth and totally and completely rejected them. I am not inconsistent, hypocritical, unstatesman and nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cYou use your own yardstick to judge others. I fear God and I respect those who respect themselves and I hope it is about time you change from a tribesman to a statesman of character. That is what Nigeria and indeed the Region you profess to love demand of you at this stage.\n\n\u201cI believe one lesson that we all must appreciate that we have all learned in the last sixty-one years of our independence is that we all need to be civil to ourselves and occasionally put ourselves in the position of others.\n\n\u201cBad language does not show prudence, wisdom and maturity. I hope you will think and adjust. Negotiation achieves better results than dictation. I believe that we should be reformists rather than being pedantic with leave-it or take-it attitude\u201d, Obasanjo stated in the letter.\n\nThe letter read further: \u201cFor me, personally. I have never shown any anger or distraught with Nigeria Delta Region nor with any part or Region of Nigeria Rather, I have always picked points on leadership performance or policies and I will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cMy records before, during and after the civil war in Nigeria Delta Region was without blemish and it was all goodwill to all the people of Nigeria and especially the people of the Niger Delta Region which was my theatre of operation during the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cI have always stood for equity and justice in our Federation and, for me tribe has to be suppressed for the state to emerge. And until the state emerges, Nigeria will not make the desired progress as tribesmen will always sacrifice state for tribe. This has always been my position and it will remain my position until breathe my last\u201d.\n\nOn allegation of double standard over resource control in the country, Obasanjo said: \u201cYou (Clark) cannot have two sovereign entities within a state which is what your position of Niger Delta ownership claim of the crude oil found in that location amounts to.\n\n\u201cThe territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Nigerian Constitution and international law. If there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today, including the Niger Delta, it is the Nigerian military backed by any other machinery that can be procured or established at the Federal level that will respond to any such threat. In principle and practice, the position taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position.\n\n\u201cMay I also recall the adjunct position I proposed that equity and justice demand that those domiciled in these locations are entitled to more of the material benefits accruing from the crude oil or other minerals. At the end of the day, it may transpire that our linguistic differences on this matter are no more than semantics. And we stand on the same logic with respect to the criminal mining of gold deposits in Zamfara State today or any other State in Nigeria or any other part of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "title": "Bayelsa spill: Experts insist wellhead leak impossible without interference",
          "text": "Experts involved in the killing of the Santa Barbara Wellhead in Nembe, Bayelsa State, have insisted that it was impossible for a wing valve installed on a wellhead to become detached so abruptly, noting that the type of action could only have been achieved if the facility was tampered with by unauthorised persons.\n\nThe wing valve is a piece of flow-control equipment used in oil and gas operations and is part of a Christmas tree used to shut in flow from an oil well.\n\nThe professionals argued that only deliberate interference with the equipment could have enabled a disruption to its normal functions.\n\nThe spillage which has now been stopped, the engineers stated, could only have occurred because the device was tampered with.\n\nThey spoke to further amplify pronouncements made by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) and the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), two critical federal agencies which earlier linked the leak to sabotage, offering further clarification on the possible cause of the spillage.\n\nDuring a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the Santa Barbara River, Nembe, both organisations on the on-site assessment of the wellhead, had agreed that the wing valve would have been tampered with by yet unknown persons, leading to the leak that enabled the blowout to occur with such intensity.\n\nRepresentative of the NURPC, Adetoyinbo Adeyemi, said the physical examination of the failed wellhead, from an engineering point of view, indicated that the pressure from the equipment was not of a sufficient level to cause a blowout leading to the type of consequence.\n\nHe said the wind valve is designed to withstand extremely high pressure and could not have failed if it had not been tampered with, explaining that the fact that the facility was not even producing, the internal well pressure would have been quite low at the time.\n\n\u201cWe are here to establish the cause of the incident that happened at the Santa Barbara Well 1. From the findings, you can see there\u2019s no spill anymore. Where the spill came out from is from the wing valve.\n\n\u201cThe wing valve has been replaced now. That means, the wing valve, the way it was, is not designed to fail like that because there are bolts surrounding it, well designed to keep the pressure in place.\n\n\u201cSo, if it had not been taken off, there is no way it could have moved from there. When it was reported initially, there was no valve in that place, and none was found. So, to us, it is an act of sabotage,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, before the well\u2019s assembly was designed, it was done to take care of any pressure from the well, insisting that the fact that the well had not been producing for a long time, meant there was no pressure to take off the valve.\n\nNOSDRA\u2019s Ismail Baba-Ahmed traced the leak to the same cause, stressing that from his expertise in fluid mechanics, his own physical examination at the site and his interactions with the wellhead experts who plugged the leak, only vandalism could have led to the blowout.\n\nHe explained that he had ascertained that the threading on the wellhead casing where the valve was removed, was not worn out, a situation that suggested the detachment of the valve was not caused by pressure.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAnother NOSDRA representative, Olubunmi Akindele, also corroborated his colleague\u2019s position, although the Bayelsa State Government representatives had disputed the outcome of the investigation and had refused to append their signatures to the official JIV report.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf this thing wasn\u2019t worn out and it was a sudden thing, then it\u2019s a surge. In addition, if it had not been building for some time, it cannot come off suddenly. That corroborates what my colleague has said.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of Kenyon International, the company which undertook the sealing of the leak, Victor Ekpenyong, in his comments, insisted that wing valves are designed to be sturdier than the pressure they are meant to withstand.\n\n\u201cIn seismic studies, before a well is designed or drilled, there\u2019s a lot of parameters that are put into consideration. One of them is the reservoir pressure. So, when the reservoir pressure is determined, the pressure that is going into the design for the well must be able to withstand the reservoir pressure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you have a reservoir pressure of 5,000 PSI and you design an equipment of 2,000 PSI. In fact, you design a higher PSI. There\u2019s no way you drill a well and the pressure will remove the Chrismas tree designed based on the seismic report.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not correct to say the pressure from the reservoir pulled out the Chrismas tree. This well was not drilled by Aiteo, it was drilled by Shell. Shell is an international company with high reputation worldwide. Aiteo inherited the well from Shell.\n\n\u201cEverything that has to do with this well was well designed and taken care of. There\u2019s no chance that the pressure can pull out the valve. In industry best practices, a well needs first line and second line maintenance. Aiteo has a procedure which I have seen,\u201d he said.\n\nEkpenyong further explained that the stud the community alleged was tampered with in the process of fixing the leak was the anti-theft device and not the knot of the valve that was vandalised.\n\nGlobal Group Director/Coordinator, Asset Protection/Security Services and Community Matters, Aiteo, Andrew Oru, also reiterated that beyond emotions and sentiments, the facility had spilled about 16,000 barrels as against a loss two million barrels that has been vaunted by certain individuals.\n\n\u201cTotal barrels recovered is 16,000. Nobody in Aiteo said two million barrels had been recovered from this place and this place is not even capable of producing two million barrels in 20 years. That\u2019s not the position, not the science. Let\u2019s forget emotions and sentiments\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Aiteo engineer, Glory Odita, disclosed the well had been in existence for about 20 years, saying wing valves do not detach on their own.\n\nThe leak which was reported on November 5 was plugged on December 8.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, gave reasons President Muhammadu Buhari withheld assent from Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement, said the Presidency took the decision in the best interest of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles. This is quite correct because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians. The President\u2019s Office has decided, therefore, to issue an official statement to make its position clear. Nigeria\u2019s strength, as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living, owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true. Rather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over. And who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course. And who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAt a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money. Inevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history. Then again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear them again in 2023.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the president will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this bill. It is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, All Progressives Congress (APC) is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\n\u201cTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games. Tell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is.\u201d",

          "title": "Obasanjo to Clark: Oil Belongs to Nigeria, Not Niger Delta",
          "text": "\u201cAll those who purchase crude oil from Nigeria enter into contractual relationship with Nigeria not with the Niger Delta. The territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, told elder statesman and leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, that oil, like the mineral resources in other parts of the country, belonged to all Nigerians. Obasanjo was responding to Clark, who recently asserted that the former president showed neither solidarity nor respect for the people of the Niger Delta in the face of the terrible environmental, social, and economic devastations they endured to produce the oil on which the Nigerian economy pivots.\n\nClark had in a protest letter alleged that for openly rebuking those advocating resource control for the Niger Delta at a public forum in Abuja, Obasanjo showed open hatred for the region.\n\nBut Obasanjo, while replying the nonagenarian, argued that until he could be legally and constitutionally persuaded otherwise, he maintained his position on the resource control question. He argued that there could not be two sovereign entities within a country, claiming the existence of dual sovereignties was what he understood from Clark\u2019s position on resource ownership.\n\nThe former president said all those, who purchased crude oil from Nigeria entered into contractual relationship with the country, and not the Niger Delta, affirming that the territory of Nigeria remains indivisible, inclusive of the resources found therein.\n\n\u201cAll those who purchase crude oil from Nigeria enter into contractual relationship with Nigeria not with the Niger Delta.\n\nThe territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Nigerian constitution and international law,\u201d he declared.\n\nObasanjo explained, \u201cIf there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today, including the Niger Delta, it is the Nigerian military, backed by any other machinery, that can be procured or established at the federal level that will respond to any such threat.\n\n\u201cIn principle and practice, the position I have taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position.\u201d\n\nThe ex-president noted that his position had always been that equity and justice demanded that those domiciled in the locations, where the resources were found, were entitled to more of the material benefits accruing from the crude oil or other minerals.\n\nHe added that he, along with Clark, stood on the same logic with respect to the \u201ccriminal\u201d mining of gold deposits in Zamfara State or any other state in Nigeria.\n\nTaking on the elder statesman based on the 1963 Constitution, Obasanjo noted that nowhere in that constitution was it said or implied that minerals located in any part of Nigeria belonged to that location.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis and to further buttress the point, the provision is even in the exclusive list \u2013 exclusively reserved for the federal government,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nWhile empathising with Clark\u2019s \u201cfrustrations\u201d with the state of the nation, Obasanjo advised that everyone must be guarded and measured in the expression of such frustrations \u201clest we throw away the baby with the dirty birth water.\u201d\n\nTo support his position, the former military general explained that if any mineral was found under the ground at his Ota farm, the federal government would ask the state government to revoke his certificate of occupancy for overriding public interest.\n\nHe pointed out that although he could lay claim for development already carried out on the farmland, the federal government would issue a licence to any company that had been allocated the right to mine the mineral.\n\n\u201cIt would not matter what I grow on my farm and what development I have carried out. Compensation I could get based on assessed development that I had carried out on the farmland,\u201d he stressed.\n\nHe opined that the constitution that affected the Niger Delta also affected Zamfara State, where gold was found, insisting that if anybody at the federal level has neglected the constitution, it is quite another matter.\n\nObasanjo stated in the response to Clark, \u201cThe gold in Ilesha, Osun State, and the lead in Ebonyi State, all come under the same law and constitution. There is no part of Nigeria, whose interest is not dear to my heart.\n\n\u201cAnd stating in your letter that it is only the interest of the north I continuously hold dear to my heart is that type of buka gossip that, knowing you as I do since 1975, I am not surprised that you echoed.\n\n\u201cI have always stood for equity and justice in our federation and, for me, tribe has to be suppressed for the state to emerge. And until the state emerges, Nigeria will not make the desired progress, as tribesmen will always sacrifice state for tribe. This has always been my position and it will remain my position until I breathe my last.\u201d\n\nHe described some portions of the open letter written by Clark as concoctions and outright distortions and lies, which might be due to loss of memory on the Ijaw leader\u2019s part or misrepresentation.\n\nObasanjo stated that on resumption of office as president of Nigeria in 1999, the first meeting he held out of Abuja was on the Niger Delta. He maintained that without being prompted, he decided the 13 per cent derivation that the new constitution granted to oil-producing areas.\n\nHe added that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) bill was his initiative for contributions to be made by state governments, oil companies and the federal government, although the states, according to him, lobbied the National Assembly to exclude them.\n\nObasanjo described the language used to describe him in Clark\u2019s letter as offensive and uncouth, saying he totally rejects them.\n\n\u201cI am not inconsistent, hypocritical, \u2018unstatesman\u2019 nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey. You use your own yardstick to judge others,\u201d he said, stressing that bad language does not show prudence, wisdom and maturity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Bayelsa Spill: Abrupt Wellhead Leak Impossible Without Interference, Experts Insist",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nExperts involved in the liquidation of the Santa Barbara Wellhead in Nembe, Bayelsa State, have argued that only deliberate interference with the equipment could have caused a disruption to its normal functions.\n\nThe spillage at the wellhead, which has now been stopped, the engineers stated, could only have emanated from tampering with the device.\n\nSpecifically, they concluded that it was impossible for a wing valve installed on a wellhead to become detached so abruptly, saying such can only happen if the facility has been altered by unauthorised persons.\n\nThe wing valve is a piece of flow-control equipment used in oil and gas operations and is part of a Christmas tree used to shut in flow from an oil well.\n\nThe professionals corroborated pronouncements by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) and the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), two critical federal agencies, which earlier linked the leak to sabotage.\n\nDuring a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the Santa Barbara River, Nembe, both organisations, based on their on-site assessment of the wellhead, had agreed that unknown persons would have been tampered with the wing valve, leading to the leak that caused the blowout.\n\nThe representative of the NURPC, Mr. Adetoyinbo Adeyemi, stated that the physical examination of the failed wellhead, from an engineering point of view, indicated that the pressure from the equipment was not of a sufficient level to cause a blowout. He explained that the wind valve was designed to withstand extremely high pressure and could not have failed if it had not been tampered. He said the fact that the facility was not even producing meant the internal well pressure would have been quite low at the time.\n\nAdeyemi stated, \u201cWe are here to establish the cause of the incident that happened at the Santa Barbara well 1. From the findings, you can see that there\u2019s no spill anymore. Where the spill came out from is from the wing valve.\n\n\u201cThe wing valve has been replaced now. That means that the wing valve, the way it was, is not designed to fail like that because there are bolts surrounding it, well designed to keep the pressure in place.\n\n\u201cSo, if it had not been taken off, there is no way it could have moved from there. When it was reported initially, there was no valve in that place, and none was found. So, to us, it is an act of sabotage.\u201d\n\nHe said the valve was designed to take care of any pressure from the well, insisting that the fact that the well had not been producing for a long time meant there was no pressure to take off the valve.\n\n\u201cThey are called the barriers to ensure that such an environment where it has been installed is not affected,\u201d the NURPC representative said. He added, So, if you are trying to compare an apple with an orange, it\u2019s going to be a wrong thing.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that if you can go back and read, you will find out the valve is not designed to fail except somebody goes there to mess it up.\u201d\n\nNOSDRA\u2019s Ismail Baba-Ahmed traced the leak to the same cause, stressing that from his expertise in fluid mechanics, his own physical examination at the site, and his interactions with the wellhead experts who plugged the leak, only vandalism could have led to the blowout. Baba-Ahmed explained that he had ascertained that the threading on the wellhead casing where the valve was removed was not worn out, a situation that suggested that the detachment of the valve was not caused by pressure.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe engineer that killed the well, I asked specifically that after killing the well, before fixing the valve, what were the circumstances of the thread? This is because if those valves were pulled out under pressure, the threads would be worn out and he answered emphatically that the threads were intact.\n\n\u201cThe most likely cause that could remove those valves was external influences. If those valves were removed under internal pressure, the thread would wear out because it will pull out.\u201d\n\nAnother NOSDRA representative, Olubunmi Akindele, also corroborated his colleague\u2019s position.\n\nAkindele stated, \u201cIf this thing wasn\u2019t worn out and it was a sudden thing, then it\u2019s a surge. In addition, if it had not been building for some time, it cannot come off suddenly. That corroborates what my colleague has said.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of Kenyon International, the company that undertook the sealing of the leak, Victor Ekpenyong, in his comments, insisted that wing valves were designed to be sturdier than the pressure they are meant to withstand.\n\nEkpenyong said, \u201cIn seismic studies, before a well is designed or drilled, there are a lot of parameters that are put into consideration. One of them is the reservoir pressure. So, when the reservoir pressure is determined, the pressure that is going into the design for the well must be able to withstand the reservoir pressure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you have a reservoir pressure of 5,000 PSI and you design an equipment of 2000 PSI. In fact, you design a higher PSI. There\u2019s no way you drill a well and the pressure will remove the Xmas tree designed based on the seismic report.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not correct to say that the pressure from the reservoir pulled out the Xmas tree. This well was not drilled by Aiteo, it was drilled by Shell. Shell is an international company with high reputation worldwide. Aiteo inherited the well from Shell.\n\n\u201cEverything that has to do with this well was well designed and taken care of. There\u2019s no chance that the pressure can pull out the valve. In industry best practices, a well needs first line and second line maintenance. Aiteo has a procedure, which I have seen.\u201d\n\nEkpenyong further explained that the stud the community alleged was tampered with in the process of fixing the leak was the anti-theft device.\n\nGlobal Group Director/Coordinator, Asset Protection/Security Services and Community Matters, Aiteo, Andrew Oru, also reiterated that beyond emotions and sentiments, the facility had spilled about 16,000 barrels, as against a loss of two million barrels that had been promoted by certain individuals.\n\nOru said, \u201cTotal barrels recovered is 16, 000. Nobody in Aiteo said two million barrels had been recovered from this place and this place is not even capable of producing two million barrels in 20 years. That\u2019s not the position, not the science. Let\u2019s forget emotions and sentiments.\u201d\n\nAnother Aiteo engineer, Glory Odita, disclosed that the well had been in existence for about 20 years, saying that wing valves do not detach on their own.\n\nAccording to him, the reservoir pressure determines the pressure valve, which he estimated to be about 6,500 PSI, adding that that kind of pressure was not possible with a well that was not in production and had been shut-in as well.\n\nThe leak, which was reported on November 5, was plugged on December 8.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nThe former President of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday said that he never hated the Niger Delta Region contrary to the accusation of Chief Edwin Clark against him sequel to Obasanjo\u2019s position on oil in the Niger Delta Region.\n\nHowever, Obasanjo in a reply to the accusation of Clark, insisted that the oil found in the Niger Delta region belonged to Nigeria constitutionally, saying pointing out the position of the constitution on an issue, should not be translated to hatred\n\nObasanjo made the assertion in a six page letter he wrote in response to accusation against him by Niger Delta elder, Chief Edwin Clark in an open letter about a week ago following his comments on the issue at a forum.\n\nClark, had accused Obasanjo of holding a deep seated disdain for the people of the oil producing region based on the former President\u2019s assertion that oil found in the Niger Delta belong to Nigeria and not the region.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Ebipamowei Woduat, had at a forum convened by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa in Abuja that Nigeria should allow Niger Delta to derive full benefits from the oil found in the region and which Obasanjo disagree with..\n\nNot pleased with the position of Obasanjo on the INC, Clark who is the leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of INC, in his open letter, said Obasanjo\u2019s comments that the oil found in the Niger Delta does not belong to the people of the region represents his continuous arrogant stance and negative disposition against Niger Delta.\n\nHowever, in his open released Tuesday, Obasanjo insisted that he had never hated Niger Delta while reiterating his stance that oil found in the region belonged to the Nigerian federation.\n\nObasanjo said, \u201cFor me personally, I have never shown any anger or distraught with Nigeria nor with any part or region of Nigeria. I will rather pick points on leadership or policies and I will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nThe former president said that his records before and after the civil war in Niger Delta Region was without blemish and it was all goodness and goodwill to all the people of Nigeria and Niger Delta.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut if you take my holding a constitutional position on federalism and reiterating the position of our past constitution \u2013 1963 Constitution as I understand it as anger or grievance against the Niger Delta or Nigeria Delta people that will be a very wrong position to take because until I can be legally and constitutional persuaded, otherwise i will continue to hold my ground.\u201d\n\nAccording to Obasanjo, the 1963 Constitution did not confer ownership of oil and other mineral resources on any of the then regions.\n\nHe insisted that just as the Niger Delta\u2019s oil belong to the Nigerian federation, the minerals in other parts of the country also belonged to the country.\n\n\u201cThe gold in Ilesha, Osun State and the lead in Ebonyi State all come under the same law and constitution. There is no part of Nigeria whose interest is not dear to my heart. And stating in your letter that it\u2019s only that interest of the North that I continually hold dear to my heart is the type of Bukah gossip that knowing you as I do since 1975, I am not suprised that you echoed.\n\n\u201cSome of the languages you have deployed to describe me in your letter are offensive, uncouth and I totally and completely rejected them.\n\n\u201cI am not inconsistent, hypocritical, un-statesman, and nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey. You use you own yardstick to judge others. I fear God and I respect those who respect themselves and I hope it is about time you change from a tribesman to a statesman,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I begged them that it was my upkeep money for my stay but they went physical on me, slapped me and asked me to use the N117,000 for myself.\n\nMy first crime for being kidnapped by the Nigerian police was being Igbo. Immediately they asked me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Igbo, they said we want to divide the country and now that Nnamdi Kanu has escaped, that we are hanging around to break the country. https://t.co/sdSmHKco12 \u2014 Solomon Buchi (@Solomon_Buchi) December 29, 2021\n\n\u201cBy the way, they stopped at a junction, and one took off his police uniform and went to withdraw the money using a POS!

After everything, they drove us back to town (Utako where I stay\u2026)\n\n\u201cThey looked for a dark place, unlocked the handcuffs and gave us our phones and cards. They took my new AirPods and valuables. Phew. This wasn\u2019t the plan at all. I felt so invaded and highly abused.\u201d",

          "text": "A life coach and motivational speaker, Solomon Buchi, has narrated how men of the Federal Capital Territory Police Command extorted N500,000 from him.\n\nIn a Twitter post on Tuesday night, the relationship coach said he and his younger brother were assaulted and treated like criminals by the policemen.\n\nHe added that they were labelled as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nBuchi said, \u201cI and my kid brother were kidnapped by the police in Abuja around Wuse 2 couple hours ago, after eating. They swiftly double-crossed our bolt ride, brought out guns and asked us to follow them into their car which wasn\u2019t a police vehicle.\n\n\u201cOn getting in, they asked where we\u2019re from, I stated that we\u2019re Igbos from Imo State, they immediately said that we\u2019re members of IPOB, they squeezed us into their car; they were five policemen.\n\n\u201cLong story short, they took our ATMs and withdrew N500,000 out of N617,000 that I had in my account. They withdrew my kid brother\u2019s N50,000. I begged them that it was my upkeep money for my stay but they went physical on me, slapped me and asked me to use the N117,000 for myself.\n\nMy first crime for being kidnapped by the Nigerian police was being Igbo. Immediately they asked me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Igbo, they said we want to divide the country and now that Nnamdi Kanu has escaped, that we are hanging around to break the country. https://t.co/sdSmHKco12 \u2014 Solomon Buchi (@Solomon_Buchi) December 29, 2021\n\n\u201cBy the way, they stopped at a junction, and one took off his police uniform and went to withdraw the money using a POS! They also wanted to transfer our crypto. Man, I can\u2019t even talk. I\u2019m traumatised. After everything, they drove us back to town (Utako where I stay\u2026)\n\n\u201cThey looked for a dark place, unlocked the handcuffs and gave us our phones and cards. They took my new AirPods and valuables. Phew. This wasn\u2019t the plan at all. I felt so invaded and highly abused.\u201d",

          "text": "A civic organisation, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, otherwise known as Intersociety, has narrated in its latest report how operatives of the Nigerian Army invaded Egudene-Ekpofu community in the Nkanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State, killing two residents.\n\nAccording to the report sent to SaharaReporters on Wednesday, the group revealed that the soldiers during an operation on December 24, 2021, invaded some churches in the community and disrupted their Christmas Eve services.\n\nIt was also reported that inter-communal movements were disrupted, forcing several residents to flee their homes into the forests or to neighbouring friendly villages.\n\nIntersociety alleged that soldiers attached to the 82 Division also killed two defenceless citizens including a 13-year old boy, Master Arum from Ohuakpaka Quarters who was shot and killed when his parents\u2019 bedroom and its doors were broken into.\n\nThe other victim was a middle-age man whose corpse was dumped at Obodo Nnemede Nwannaji near Onokolo Ode in the community.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers of the Nigerian Army had between forbidden hours of 24th and 25th Night of December 2021 invaded Egudene-Ekpofu in Nkanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State and raided popular squares and quarters and several family houses during which Christmas Eve Church services and intra and inter communal movements were disrupted, forcing several citizens of the community to flee their homes into the forests or across their neighbouring friendly villages.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers also during the operation attacked and raided houses and destroyed properties including doors, windows, electronics, etc; disrupted sleep, assaulted married and unmarried women and woke children from their sleep and traumatised them.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers of the Nigerian Army under Enugu 82 Division also killed two defenceless citizens including a 13-year old boy (Master Arum from Ohuakpaka Quarters) who was shot and killed when his parents\u2019 bedroom and its doors were broken into and as he was running helplessly for his dear life, the soldiers opened fire on him at close range and killed him instantly. The soldiers also shot and killed a yet-to-be middle-age man whose corpse was dumped at Obodo Nnemede Nwannaji near Onokolo Ode in the Community.\n\n\u201cAs if the above dastardly acts were not enough, the soldiers also sighted a palm wine tapper on a palm tree and opened fire. He is presently admitted at the Enugu Specialist Hospital. Not done, the soldiers accosted another up-wine (palm) tapper and dispossessed him of his 5 gallons of up-wine valued at N25,000. His name is Chigozie Obushi.\n\n\u201cThrough the use of threatened and terrified locals as \u201cinformants\u201d who were forced to show them the dwelling houses of the community\u2019s young men of productive age bracket (20-50 years), the soldiers attacked and invaded several houses that same late night of 24th/25th December 2021 and abducted scores from their sleep. Also not spared were the late night Christmas returnees and those returning from Christmas Eve Church services as well as those attending Christmas morning Church services.\u201d\n\nIntersociety added that contrary to a statement by the Nigerian Army Director of Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu that soldiers arrested a wanted notorious ESN commander in the community, \u201cthe man being detained is an unarmed 40-year-old mason who was abducted from his rest and sleep following his sick-rest arising from work related stress and pains.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy a detailed investigation carried out by the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law and contrary to the Nigerian Army claims, the so called \u201cESN Commander\u201d, identified by the Army as \u201cGodwin Nnamdi\u201d, is a 40 year-old mason and struggling father of two children. His true name is Godwin Nnaji (not Godwin Nnamdi).\n\n\u201cHis other identities are; he hails from Umuode Ega Kindred of Egudene in Ajame Amaeze Autonomous community, Ekpofu in Nkanu East, Enugu State. He struggles to feed himself, his wife and two children. Abducted and falsely labelled Nnaji is married to Mrs. Blessing Nnaji (nee Nnaji) from Ogonogo-Eji Ndiagu Akpugo Autonomous Community in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\n\u201cHe was abducted from his rest and sleep following his sick-rest arising from work related stress and pains. He had taken some pain relief tablets and was sleeping when soldiers stormed his family house at about 12:21am on the Christmas Eve/early morning of 25th December 2021 and abducted him. Present in the family\u2019s dwelling house during his abduction were his mother-Madam Theresa Nnaji and two of his siblings including his blind younger brother, Onyema Nnaji who was also rough-handled and assaulted.\n\n\u201cNnaji was fallaciously labelled \u201cESN Commander\u201d because a bangle with \u2018rising sun\u2019 insignia was found on him. The soldiers later took him alongside other abductees to the 82 Division Headquarters in Enugu through Inyaba River into Oruku town and drove to their 82 Division Headquarters through Emene. After his abduction, Nnaji was bundled alongside others to Onokolo Market Square in the Community where he was mercilessly beaten and stripped half naked.\n\n\u201cHe has been located to be detained at \u2018Galaxy Detention Camp\u2019 of the 82 Division in Enugu and one of his younger brothers who went to see him was denied access by the lady Army officer in charge who said she is under superior instructions not to allow him to be visited or seen by anybody. Therefore, the claims by the Nigerian Army highlighted above are circumstantially fallacious and trademark of the Nigerian security forces particularly the Nigerian Army with which they have framed, abducted and killed hundreds of defenceless and unarmed citizens of Southeast and South-south Nigeria especially between October 2020 and December 2021.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact and uttermost immediacy and inexcusability, Citizen Godwin Nnaji must be freed unconditionally; likewise others abducted and being held captive by the soldiers of the 82 Division in Enugu. The Nigerian Army must also let the affected communities particularly Egudene-Ekpofu be and discontinue all forms of siege and associated brutalisation and riotous brigandage in the area.\u201d",

          "title": "'Illegal' Ikoyi weddings, COVID electric bulbs... how fake news shaped events in 2021",
          "text": "As fake news and misinformation continue to take major stage worldwide, 2021 was no exception. It has been a year fully packed with viral distorted images, tweets, articles and statements. While many persons shared such messages without a doubt, others took a step back and questioned the claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs soon as such misleading content pierces through the walls of social media, it enjoys wide circulation and begins to look like facts. Most of these misleading claims have been subjected to verification by TheCable\u2019s fact-check desk.\n\nIn this article, we highlight some prominent fake news that hit the waves in the year.\n\nDID COURT NULLIFY WEDDINGS DONE AT IKOYI REGISTRY?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the month, the fake news about the nullification of weddings sealed at the Ikoyi registry became the biggest news item across all platforms.\n\nSome media reports inaccurately claimed that a federal high court sitting in Lagos, on December 8, granted an order nullifying all weddings conducted by the registry since 2004 and ordered the shutdown of the marriage registry.\n\nThe news was also shared by several social media users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what did the court actually say?\n\nAccording to a document obtained by TheCable, a federal high court sitting in Lagos, on December 8, did not grant an order nullifying all weddings conducted by the Ikoyi registry. It is also untrue that the court ordered the shutdown of the federal marriage registry.\n\nHowever, D.E. Osiagor, the presiding judge, submitted that the local government councils are statutorily responsible for issuing marriage certificates in Nigeria and restrained the ministry of interior from \u201cfurther contracting marriages within the plaintiff\u2019s local government council areas except marriages conducted in the marriage registries of Ikoyi, Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nLAI MOHAMMED ON TWITTER FUNDING #ENDSARS PROTEST\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to the Twitter ban in Nigeria on June 5, Lai Mohammed, minister of information, accused Twitter of \u201cdouble standards\u201d after the microblogging site deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe minister further claimed that the social media platform funded #EndSARS protesters during the demonstrations against police brutality in 2020.\n\nJack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO at the time, was among the popular figures who backed Nigerians during the protest and retweeted the call for donation by a feminist coalition group.\n\nTheCable\u2019s fact-check, however, showed that there was no evidence to substantiate that Twitter or its former CEO actually funded the protest as claimed by the minister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFANI-KAYODE AND THE NON-EXISTENT MILITARY ATTACK\n\nOn September 7, Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation, published a post on his verified Facebook page alongside some pictures where he claimed that the Nigerian Army had killed \u201cbloodlusting murderous terrorists\u201d in the northern part of the country.\n\nTheCable analysed the pictures shared by the former aviation minister and findings revealed that they were old pictures of other events, some of which did not happen in Nigeria.\n\nDSS VS IGBOHO SAGA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn July 1, the Department of State Services (DSS) said it recovered illegal arms, cash and charms from the home of Sunday Adeyemo, a youth leader better known as Sunday Igboho, during a raid by operatives of the agency in Ibadan, Oyo state capital.\n\nAttached to the information were pictures of the arms \u2014 including seven AK-47 rifles \u2014 charms and other items taken from Igboho\u2019s house.\n\nHowever, some social media users claimed that the pictures posted by the DSS were old images uploaded on Facebook in 2013.\n\nTheCable\u2019s fact-check revealed that the pictures had not appeared online before the DSS shared them. Hence, they were not old pictures being recirculated.\n\nCOVID VACCINE AND THE ELECTRIC BULBS\n\nSome videos were circulated on the internet where some individuals who allegedly received the COVID vaccine claimed that when a LED bulb is placed against the spot where the vaccine is injected, it lights up.\n\nThe claim stated that the COVID vaccine contains ingredients that make a bulb produce electricity.\n\nA fact-check by TheCable showed that the COVID vaccine does not contain any implant and therefore cannot light up electrical bulbs.\n\nFAKE VIDEO OF BOKO HARAM CONVERTING RESIDENTS\n\nIn May, an alleged video of Boko Haram insurgents \u201cforcefully\u201d converting residents of Niger to Islam was circulated on social media. In the viral video, many residents especially women could be seen gathered in what appeared to be a remote location.\n\nTheCable, however, found out that the video emanated from Kolia, a town in Ivory Coast.\n\nAbubakar Bello, governor of Niger, also debunked the video, describing it as misleading.\n\nKANO TO BAN WOMEN FROM DRIVING?\n\nIn July, a viral report claimed the Kano government was planning to draft a bill prohibiting women from driving vehicles in the state.\n\nThe report trended on social media and was widely shared.\n\nBut the state government refuted the claim, describing it as unsubstantiated and lacking in credibility.\n\nTHAT PHOTOSHOPPED FRONT PAGE ON UZODIMMA\n\nIn August, a purported front-page publication of THISDAY newspaper alleged that Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, had declared \u201cfree marriages\u201d between Fulani settlers and Imo ladies. The report credited to the newspaper was widely publicised on social media platforms and instant messengers.\n\nReacting to the claim, Eniola Bello, managing director of THISDAY, said the newspaper never published the story in question, adding that a digital copy of the newspaper was manipulated.",

          "title": "'Illegal' Ikoyi weddings, COVID electric bulbs... how fake news shaped events in 2021",
          "text": "As fake news and misinformation continue to take major stage worldwide, 2021 was no exception. It has been a year fully packed with viral distorted images, tweets, articles and statements. While many persons shared such messages without a doubt, others took a step back and questioned the claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs soon as such misleading content pierces through the walls of social media, it enjoys wide circulation and begins to look like facts. Most of these misleading claims have been subjected to verification by TheCable\u2019s fact-check desk.\n\nIn this article, we highlight some prominent fake news that hit the waves in the year.\n\nDID COURT NULLIFY WEDDINGS DONE AT IKOYI REGISTRY?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the month, the fake news about the nullification of weddings sealed at the Ikoyi registry became the biggest news item across all platforms.\n\nSome media reports inaccurately claimed that a federal high court sitting in Lagos, on December 8, granted an order nullifying all weddings conducted by the registry since 2004 and ordered the shutdown of the marriage registry.\n\nThe news was also shared by several social media users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what did the court actually say?\n\nAccording to a document obtained by TheCable, a federal high court sitting in Lagos, on December 8, did not grant an order nullifying all weddings conducted by the Ikoyi registry. It is also untrue that the court ordered the shutdown of the federal marriage registry.\n\nHowever, D.E. Osiagor, the presiding judge, submitted that the local government councils are statutorily responsible for issuing marriage certificates in Nigeria and restrained the ministry of interior from \u201cfurther contracting marriages within the plaintiff\u2019s local government council areas except marriages conducted in the marriage registries of Ikoyi, Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nLAI MOHAMMED ON TWITTER FUNDING #ENDSARS PROTEST\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to the Twitter ban in Nigeria on June 5, Lai Mohammed, minister of information, accused Twitter of \u201cdouble standards\u201d after the microblogging site deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe minister further claimed that the social media platform funded #EndSARS protesters during the demonstrations against police brutality in 2020.\n\nJack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO at the time, was among the popular figures who backed Nigerians during the protest and retweeted the call for donation by a feminist coalition group.\n\nTheCable\u2019s fact-check, however, showed that there was no evidence to substantiate that Twitter or its former CEO actually funded the protest as claimed by the minister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFANI-KAYODE AND THE NON-EXISTENT MILITARY ATTACK\n\nOn September 7, Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation, published a post on his verified Facebook page alongside some pictures where he claimed that the Nigerian Army had killed \u201cbloodlusting murderous terrorists\u201d in the northern part of the country.\n\nTheCable analysed the pictures shared by the former aviation minister and findings revealed that they were old pictures of other events, some of which did not happen in Nigeria.\n\nDSS VS IGBOHO SAGA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn July 1, the Department of State Services (DSS) said it recovered illegal arms, cash and charms from the home of Sunday Adeyemo, a youth leader better known as Sunday Igboho, during a raid by operatives of the agency in Ibadan, Oyo state capital.\n\nAttached to the information were pictures of the arms \u2014 including seven AK-47 rifles \u2014 charms and other items taken from Igboho\u2019s house.\n\nHowever, some social media users claimed that the pictures posted by the DSS were old images uploaded on Facebook in 2013.\n\nTheCable\u2019s fact-check revealed that the pictures had not appeared online before the DSS shared them. Hence, they were not old pictures being recirculated.\n\nCOVID VACCINE AND THE ELECTRIC BULBS\n\nSome videos were circulated on the internet where some individuals who allegedly received the COVID vaccine claimed that when a LED bulb is placed against the spot where the vaccine is injected, it lights up.\n\nThe claim stated that the COVID vaccine contains ingredients that make a bulb produce electricity.\n\nA fact-check by TheCable showed that the COVID vaccine does not contain any implant and therefore cannot light up electrical bulbs.\n\nFAKE VIDEO OF BOKO HARAM CONVERTING RESIDENTS\n\nIn May, an alleged video of Boko Haram insurgents \u201cforcefully\u201d converting residents of Niger to Islam was circulated on social media. In the viral video, many residents especially women could be seen gathered in what appeared to be a remote location.\n\nTheCable, however, found out that the video emanated from Kolia, a town in Ivory Coast.\n\nAbubakar Bello, governor of Niger, also debunked the video, describing it as misleading.\n\nKANO TO BAN WOMEN FROM DRIVING?\n\nIn July, a viral report claimed the Kano government was planning to draft a bill prohibiting women from driving vehicles in the state.\n\nThe report trended on social media and was widely shared.\n\nBut the state government refuted the claim, describing it as unsubstantiated and lacking in credibility.\n\nTHAT PHOTOSHOPPED FRONT PAGE ON UZODIMMA\n\nIn August, a purported front-page publication of THISDAY newspaper alleged that Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, had declared \u201cfree marriages\u201d between Fulani settlers and Imo ladies. The report credited to the newspaper was widely publicised on social media platforms and instant messengers.\n\nReacting to the claim, Eniola Bello, managing director of THISDAY, said the newspaper never published the story in question, adding that a digital copy of the newspaper was manipulated.",

          "text": "From the sack of Emeka Ihedioha as duly elected governor of Imo state to the removal of David Lyon as Bayelsa governor, the judiciary, in 2020, delivered unexpected decisions that would hold a major place in Nigeria\u2019s history for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn January 14, 2020, a seven-member panel of the supreme court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Ihedioha, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and issue a fresh one to Hope Uzodimma, who the court declared as the winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election.\n\nUzodimma had argued that INEC wrongfully excluded the results of 388 polling units where he reportedly garnered high votes.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the apex court, Ihedioha had filed an application asking the same court to review its decision and set it aside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the judgment delivered on March 3, 2020, six out of the seven-member panel of the apex court led by Ibrahim Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), dismissed Ihedioha\u2019s review application.\n\n\u201cThe finality of the supreme court is entrenched in the constitution. Inherent powers can only be evoked if there is a missing link and that is why sometimes the court could be called upon to dot the i and cross the t,\u201d said Olukayode Ariola, who read the majority judgement.\n\n\u201cThe finality of the supreme court in civil cases is final.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Chima Nweze, one of the judges, disagreed with the ruling.\n\nIn his dissenting judgment, Nweze asked the court to set aside the January 14 judgment that removed Ihedioha from office, describing it as a nullity and in bad faith.\n\nHe held that Uzodimma misled the court into an unjust conclusion with the unverified votes in 388 polling units.\n\n\u201cThis decision of the supreme court will continue to haunt our electoral jurisprudence for a long time to come,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my intimate reading of the January 14 judgment, the substance of Ihedioha\u2019s matter was lost to time frame. This court once set aside its own earlier judgment and therefore cannot use time frame to extinguish the right of any person.\n\n\u201cThis court has powers to overrule itself and can revisit any decision not in accordance with justice. This court has a duty of redeeming its image. I am of the view that this application should succeed.\n\n\u201cI hereby make an order setting aside the decision of this court made on January 14 and that the certificate of return issued to the appellant be returned to INEC. I also make an order restoring the respondents as winner of the March 9 governorship election.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one months after the supreme court ruling, it appears the dust is yet to settle in Imo, with accusations and counter accusations between Rochas Okorocha, immediate past governor of the state, and Uzodimma, his successor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings took a different turn on Sunday with the arrest of Uche Nwosu, candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) and son-in-law of Okorocha, who was picked up by security operatives in a church.\n\nPrior to the arrest, Okorocha and Uzodimma \u2014 both members of the APC \u2014 have been at loggerheads, leading to court issues and sealing off of properties linked to the former.\n\nAlthough the circumstances that led to Nwosu\u2019s arrest are relatively unclear, Okorocha has accused Uzodimma of ordering the raid.\n\nThe AA candidate, who was released hours after he was taken into custody, has also insisted that he wasn\u2019t invited prior to the arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, with the concerns raised on the verdict on the Imo governorship election, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to decline assent to the electoral bill, which recommends electronic transmission of election results, may need a proper review to improve Nigeria\u2019s voting system.",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "West African e-commerce platforms take local fashion makers global",
          "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved and wanted to wear African prints more here,\u201d says Bami Adenike, expressing her enduring fondness for African wear despite staying close to alluring luxury boutiques in Paris. Adenike, a 28-year-old Nigerian artist, moved to France in 2016 and has mostly bought clothes from French fashion retail stores since relocating due to the prohibitive costs of having custom-made African dresses shipped to Europe.\n\nBy late 2020, when Adenike wanted to update her closet, she discovered a number of online platforms offering to deliver African apparel to Europe, at affordable rates, and took a chance ordering through Fashtracker, a marketplace that connects more than 40 African designers with local and international consumers. Within two weeks, her prints were delivered to her door in Paris by DHL.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I was shocked the dresses were well fitted. I used to spend hours looking through Ankara images on Pinterest without any idea how to get them,\u201d she told TechCabal on a phone call. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become a norm for me to patronise brands from Nigeria and sometimes other West African countries.\u201d\n\nAfrican fashion has in recent times attracted significant media interest from the Global North, partly fueled by megastars\u2014such as Naomi Campbell, Alicia Keys, and Beyonc\u00e9\u2014who occasionally rock clothes designed on the continent. Last year, the latter, a 28-time Grammy award winner, was spotted wearing a patterned dress and wide-leg pants made by Tongoro, a Senegalese brand owned by designer Sarah Diouf.\n\nWhile entertainment celebrities have had a hand in propelling African designers to international fame, Africans in the diaspora like Adenike are the biggest consumers of clothes exported from the continent, with e-commerce platforms\u2014such as Nigeria-based Fashtracker and Ivorian site Afrikrea\u2014playing middlemen.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe African Union Commission defines the African Diaspora as \u201cpeoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union\u201d. Globally, this group is spread out across several continents. An estimated 36 million Africans live outside the country of their birth, with just over 50% resident within the continent. The sheer size of the African Diaspora means there\u2019s a large potential market for African fashion collections outside the continent.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal for this article, Fashtracker founder and CEO Wunmi Akinsola revealed the platform was originally built to serve markets in Africa. But that changed when the team realised more traction was coming from outside the continent than within. \u201cI was only running ads for Nigeria and neighbouring countries, and yet about half of my customers came from other parts of the world. So, it became obvious that there\u2019s a massive market out there,\u201d Akinsola said.\n\nMoulaye Tabour\u00e9, the founder of Afrikrea, grew up in Mali but has lived and worked in several countries. While in Paris, he discovered that the Africans he came across abroad were mostly interested in African fashion items but could not readily access them. That inspired the founding of his online marketplace in 2016 with the ambition to export African culture globally.\n\n\u201cA few months after we launched and had some designers, our close ones noticed we were wearing more African products and got more interested,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cAfrikrea led us to consume more from African businesses, not by solidarity or charity, but out of pure interest.\u201d\n\nThis year, Afrikrea\u2019s community of merchants has carried out almost \u20ac8 million worth of transactions, according to the company\u2019s data, with over 80% of its orders coming from outside the continent\u201440% from Europe and 30% from the US. It claims to record more than 500,000 site visits monthly.\n\nDespite facing stiff competition from several other similar platforms, Tabour\u00e9 believes product diversity has helped Afrikrea grow rapidly, considering the African Diaspora isn\u2019t a monolithic group. \u201cThe black diaspora is the largest in the world and also probably the most heterogeneous. So having a wide array of sellers, products, and experiences to cater to everyone has always been key to our success,\u201d he said.\n\nAfrikrea and its counterparts are increasingly attracting African designers and micro-businesses along the fashion and art value chains that wish to gain awareness among customers outside the continent. Within five years, Afrikrea grew its seller base from 500 to 10,000 across 47 African countries and currently allows them to showcase and sell African-inspired clothing and accessories to 170 countries around the world.\n\nEssentially, these platforms provide a gateway to reach global consumers demanding African fashion collections and handle all the resource-intensive components, including marketing, cross-border shipping, and payments, which would otherwise hinder local fashion designers and dealers from selling outside their national borders.\n\n\u201cAfter launching on Instagram and boosting our post, we started getting a lot of inquiries from people abroad about purchasing items. But there was no way to get things to them effectively,\u201d says John Pelumi Oyedokun, founder and creative director of Mode Vert Limited, a Nigerian company behind fashion label Jon Pelumi, which launched in 2019. Oyedokun then partnered with Fashtracker after Akinsola reached out to him. \u201cAfter signing up [on Fashtracker], we\u2019re able to sell our products to a growing customer base in Ghana, the US, and Canada.\u201d\n\nFor Olakunmi Oni, Lagos-based fashion designer and the founder of minimalist women\u2019s clothing line, 1964 Brand, selling online and shipping abroad was never a problem but admits that listing her brand products on Fashtracker \u201cshows our designs to a much wider audience.\u201d\n\nTypically, designers selling on e-commerce sites can create storefronts and receive payments from anywhere in the world. Once a purchase is made, the platform deducts a commission of 10-15% per sale. For the logistics side of things, Afrikrea, for instance, has a partnership with DHL that allows micro-retailers selling via its platform to ship to their customers for as low as $20 per package. The company also recently launched ANKA, a SaaS e-commerce solution for African fashion designers and merchants, offering a single dashboard to manage multiple sales channels, inventory, and payments.\n\nAnkara dresses are now popular among Africans and non-Africans in Europe and North America, thanks to e-commerce.

Africa\u2019s e-commerce opportunity is estimated to be $19.8 billion by Statista, and in terms of general e-commerce activities on the continent, McKinsey & Company estimates consumer spending to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025.\n\nThat presents an opportunity for local retailers to promote African fashion globally, especially with consumers increasingly switching to online shopping amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic. For designers, partnerships with e-commerce platforms transform their otherwise small tailor businesses into fashion brands with global patronage while opening up the $31 billion sub-Saharan Africa clothing market to the rest of the world.\n\nBut scaling globally isn\u2019t without its own challenges. Custom officers mostly within the continent still pose a major constraint to cross-border shipment, especially in the absence of an effective free trade agreement. \u201cInitiatives like the AfCFTA are there but yet to become concrete realities,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 said. He adds that African governments can do more by facilitating customs for people shipping outside of the continent, particularly to Europe. \u201cWe want to take African culture to you wherever you are. Our job is mainly to remain optimistic but pragmatic.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Web3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve come across the buzzword, non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet, chances are you have also seen the latest buzzword \u2014 Web3. Both words are generated by proponents of blockchain technology and crypto heads who believe it is the future of the Internet.\n\nAlthough some people like Elon Musk have said the word is a mere \u201cmarketing buzzword than reality right now,\u201d a deeper look at it suggests it could change not just the Internet but the world economy as we know it. But before I suggest that Musk could be wrong and sound like a crypto head myself, what exactly is Web3?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting web3 is real \u2013 seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now \u2013 just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2021\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is simply the Internet that belongs to everyone. A decentralised World Wide Web owned by no one but run based on everyone\u2019s decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what Web3 is and the rationale behind its formation, it is important to start from the beginning \u2014 the first and second generations of the web and how they\u2019re different from the imminent third generation.\n\nWeb1: The beginning\n\nWeb1 is the earliest version of what we call the Internet today. According to a 2014 paper by Nupur Choudhury, World Wide Web and Its Journey from Web 1.0 to Web 4.0, the Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1989. He envisioned the Web in three ways: a Web of documents (Web1), a Web of people (Web2) and a Web of data (Web3).\n\nIt is accurately referred to as \u201cread-only web\u201d as there were very few visuals besides text. Unlike today\u2019s Internet that allows users to interact with information online, users of Web1 were more passive and only read things online.\n\nThere was no comment section like you have on the Techpoint Africa website or Twitter or Facebook where you air your views or share your opinion about someone else\u2019s. To get an excellent example of what Web1 is like, visit Cameron\u2019s World, a web-collage of text and images from 1994 to 2009. Another great example will be what CNN used to look like in 2000.\n\nBerners-Lee is a British scientist who worked at Organisation Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN). He submitted the proposal for what is known as the Internet today as an effective communication system at CERN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim-Berners-Lee. Source: Britannica\n\nHowever, Berners-Lee realised that what he had proposed was far more powerful than just being a communication system within CERN but for the whole world. He and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, decided to connect information on the Web with hypertext and the Internet was formed.\n\nInterestingly, the first iteration of the Internet was very different from what we have now. To millennials or Gen Zs, Web1 was more or less looking at an offline doc.\n\nWeb2: Current dispensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nBy 2004 the era of Web1 was about to fade away and the second iteration of the Internet was on its way. It would mark the beginning of user-generated content on the web. The same way Web3 is causing a stir now on the Internet, the coming of Web2 also did the same thing. It was dubbed a movement and a new wave of social services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the words of Tim O\u2019 Riley, Co-Founder of the O\u2019Riley Media and the man who popularised the term Web2, \u201cWeb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.\n\n\u201cChief among those rules is this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better the more people use them.\u201d\n\nWeb2 was truly transformative; it birthed social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which have dominated online social interactions to date. Cloud computing, eCommerce, financial services and many of the things we enjoy on the Internet today were only possible with the creation of Web2.\n\nAlthough Web2 stirred as much excitement as Web3 is doing now, people calmed down when Web2 became an everyday thing.\n\nThis is Web3\n\nWeb3 underpins the idea behind the creation of cryptocurrencies which is simply decentralisation. The technologies behind cryptocurrency, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also be a crucial part of Web3.\n\nLike Web2, Web3 wants to make the Internet more inclusive but, in contrast, take control away from big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It aims to do this by decentralising the Internet.\n\nMat Dryhurst, a Berlin artist and a proponent of the Web3 revolution, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of companies that own all this stuff, and then there\u2019s us who use it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we don\u2019t have anything to show for it.\u201d\n\nBut how will Web3 give people control of the Internet? We\u2019re already seeing a glimpse of how Web3 will work with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anyone and every data on the Bitcoin network is not in a single place, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nWhat to prepare for with Web3\n\nWith Web3, user data on the Internet is not held by Google or Facebook; it\u2019s on a blockchain that belongs to everyone. According to Business Insider Africa, you\u2019ll only need a single account to do anything on the Internet. For example, the same account will be used for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Jumia, Bolt, and even Techpoint Africa.\n\nBasically, all of the applications and websites online will be decentralised. So, we\u2019ll log in to these applications the same way we use the Web3 wallet, Metamask, to log into blockchain platforms like decentralised finance.\n\nFor example, to buy or upload an NFT on OpenSea, an NFT market, you only need to connect your Metamask wallet, and it identifies you. The same Metamask wallet can be used to log in to other NFT marketplaces like Rarible and SuperRare. In fact, decentralised finance platforms (DeFi), decentralised exchanges (DEX) and virtually every Web3-enabled application will work with that same wallet.\n\nAnother huge part of Web3 will be artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI works with Web2, the third generation of the Internet will help AI understand the content on the web the same way humans do, making AI a lot smarter. In an example by CoinMarketCap, AI will not just understand words but the emotions behind the words with something called Semantic Web, a writing standard on the web that makes online content readable for AI and machines.\n\nIt is important to note that a large part of what Web3 is said to be capable of hasn\u2019t been seen or tested. However, many venture capitalists seem to believe strongly in the Web3 future.\n\nThis year alone, $27 billion has been raised by Web3-related startups, which is over 1,200% more than what the whole African startup ecosystem raised in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nGetting started with Web3 in 2022\n\nAlthough the idea of Web3 isn\u2019t fully formed, platforms that embody the concept already exist, and they\u2019re creating sources of collaboration and income for people. Such platforms include decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse.\n\nHowever, there are financial and educational barriers to entering these platforms as they\u2019re very new and complicated. So, the first step to getting started with Web3 will be learning, for instance, knowing how to get into the world of non-fungible tokens.\n\nWhile Web3 might be a new concept, there\u2019s quite enough content about it on the Internet, and a quick Google search could do a lot of wonders.\n\nWhen it comes to earning with Web3, on the other hand, a quick search on the Internet might not cut it. However, gaming seems like the least risky way to profit from the new Internet iteration.\n\nIn Africa, platforms like the Metaverse Magna have made it easy to profit from crypto gaming with their scholarship programme. It provides players with the assets they need to compete on crypto gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity, where they can earn up to $2,000 a month.\n\nA career in Web3 is also another path to profiting from it in 2022. Web3 and blockchain experts are in high demand as the field is still new. Dapp University is a great place to start learning about careers within Web3.\n\nWhile Web3 might be the shiny new future of the Internet, only time will tell if it will deliver on its many promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I will not do anything behind your back, as we will sit together to negotiate and make decisions that will benefit us all.\n\n\u201cI am a digital governor; I work with data. Even without delineation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), no ward in Oredo has less than 25 polling units.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cFor the purpose of appointment, Oredo is now 25 wards, not 12 anymore. It will affect everything else, including the number of Senior Special Assistants (SSAs) and Special Assistants (SAs). Leaders should meet today and finalise the list of political appointees and submit it to me. I will announce the names on the list by 7 pm and the inauguration will be done tomorrow in Government House by 12 noon.\u201d\n\nCharging on politics of inclusion, the governor noted that the target for the party\u2019s e-registration exercise is one million members, adding, \u201cAny party that doesn\u2019t include people to share in its ideology is already a failure as everyone is important to the party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Senator Representing Edo-South Senatorial District, Sen. Matthew Urghohide reiterated the need for the party to remain one united family, noting that politics is a game of numbers.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle that we are using, which is the PDP, is not the exclusive right of anybody.

          "text": "The presidency said yesterday that because of the huge financial burden associated with direct primaries, only the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) will benefit from such an arrangement\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, stated this while explaining why President Muhammadu Buhari rejected assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nIn a statement he issued yesterday, Shehu noted that the president\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the bill has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\n\nAccording to him, it is quite correct for only two parties to benefit from the process because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoting that the president\u2019s office decided to issue an official statement to make its position clear, Shehu explained that Nigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa, with one of its highest standards of living, owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\nHe said it is this act which the new bill seeks to amend, adding that the amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes.\n\nStating that after careful review, the president\u2019s office has found that the opposite is true, he said, \u201cRather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over.\n\n\u201cAnd who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course. And who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties. At a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cInevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThen again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear from them again in 2023.Until then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this country\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman noted that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties.\n\n\u201cBut it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\n\u201cTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games. Tell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari had written back to the National Assembly leadership, saying he was averse to the clause which mandates all political parties to adopt direct primaries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe cited the high cost of conducting direct primaries, the security challenge of monitoring the election, violation of citizens\u2019 rights and marginalisation of small political parties as reasons for rejecting the bill.\n\nThe Senators who threatened to override the president\u2019s veto if he fails to sign the bill caved in and opted for consultations with their counterparts in the House of Representatives, constituents before taking a stand in January next year.",

          "text": "Force Majeure declared by oil major, Shell in Nigeria and production disruptions in two other countries have caused supply hiccups in the international oil market prompting prices to extend gains on Tuesday.\n\nBrent crude traded near $80 a barrel despite the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, supported by supply outages and expectations that U.S. inventories fell last week.\n\nBrent crude rose by 55 cents, or 0.7 per cent to $79.15 a barrel after hitting a session high of $79.85. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 73 cents, or 1 per cent to $76.30, after rising to $76.92.\n\nBoth contracts reportedly traded at their highest in a month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSupport comes as well from high aggregated production disruptions in Ecuador, Libya and Nigeria and the expectation of another large drop in U.S. crude inventories,\u201d said UBS oil analyst, Giovanni Staunovo.\n\nLEADERSHIP reported that about 200,000 barrels of crude oil is currently stranded as oil major Shell Plc halted crude shipments from Nigeria\u2019s Forcados export terminal.\n\nThe action is considered another blow to Nigeria which has struggled to stem falling production.\n\nShell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria Ltd issued a notice of force majeure on Forcados shipments, effective from midday on December 21, and plans to issue a revised offtake program in due course.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore than 200,000 barrels a day of Nigerian crude normally pass through the terminal.\n\nThe shutdown comes just a month after Shell said it was restoring flows from the nearby Bonny facility. Force majeure is a clause that allows companies to skip contractual obligations following issues outside of their control.\n\nThe stoppage occurred during replacement of one of the two single point moorings at Forcados, with the positioning of a jack-up barge preventing tanker access, export operations and resumption of full production into the terminal, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said in a notice.\n\nThe presence of the jack-up offshore support vessel Seacor Strength at the Forcados moorings was confirmed by ship tracking data monitored by Bloomberg.\n\nNeither the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) nor Shell gave an indication of the likely duration of the stoppage. The force majeure suggests it will be long enough to affect four remaining cargoes that a port agent report seen by Bloomberg shows are due to be loaded this month.\n\nSince Shell announced the month-long force majeure at the Bonny site in October, only one ship has loaded a cargo from that terminal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresently, Nigeria, Libya and Ecuador have declared force majeures this month on part of their oil production because of maintenance issues and oilfield shutdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday that U.S. crude oil inventories are likely to have dropped for the fifth week in a row, while gasoline inventories were seen mostly unchanged last week.\n\nEngland will not face any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday, as the government awaits more evidence on whether the health service can cope with high infection rates.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to ease a shortage of COVID-19 tests as the Omicron variant threatens to overwhelm hospitals and stifle travel plans.\n\nInvestors are awaiting an OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, at which the alliance will decide whether to go ahead with a planned production increase of 400,000 barrels per day in February.\n\nAt its last meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plans to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nRussia is unlikely to hit its May target of pre-pandemic oil output levels due to a lack of spare production capacity but could do so later in the year, analysts and company sources said on Tuesday.\n\nMoney managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to December 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday.\n\nThe speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 4,634 contracts to 259,093 during the period.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s effort to meet its production quota recorded a 10 percentage points drop month on month to 239 per cent in November even as the country raised production slightly.\n\nOverall, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC)+ compliance with oil production cuts rose to 117 per cent in November from 116 per cent a month earlier, two sources from the group told Reuters, indicating production levels remain well below agreed targets.",

Their plan is to eliminate him so that the Yoruba Nation agenda will be silenced, but God has shown that he is above them.\u201d\n\nIgboho cannot be released through the judicial system, according to Koiki, because the Benin Republic judiciary is broken.\n\nHe bemoaned the diplomatic approach\u2019s failure, noting that the President of the Benin Republic, Talon, had refused to release Igboho.\n\n\u201cIf you think the legal route is what will set Igboho free, then we are wasting our time.\n\n\u201cBenin Republic judicial system is not working. Look at the way his case has been prolonged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with our lawyer in Benin, and he told me that only the president can set him free.\n\n\u201cNow, diplomacy cannot work. We have to fight for our rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve issued so many ultimata for Igboho\u2019s release, but nothing has happened,\u201d he added.\n\nIgboho had absconded from Nigeria to Benin Republic, following the invasion of his Ibadan residence by the Department of State Service, DSS.\n\nDSS had claimed it raided Igboho\u2019s residence over allegation of the agitator stockpiling arms and ammunition.\n\nHowever, the agitator was arrested at an airport in Cotonou, while trying to travel to Germany.\n\nIgboho\u2019s problem started with his decision to confront armed Fulani herders in the Southwest.\n\nFrom issuing an ultimatum to Fulani herders in the Southwest, Igboho delved into agitation for Yoruba Nation.",

He will begin the role in a part-time capacity at the start of next month.\n\n\u2018This flexibility is beneficial for both John and the Academy, as it allows him to continue to develop his own coaching skills alongside other commitments, while being used optimally within our development programme.\u2019\n\nTerry has delighted in his latest role, telling supporters that he is \u2018coming home\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to announce that I\u2019m coming home, and have taken up a consultancy role @ChelseaFC academy,\u2019 he tweeted. \u2018As well as delivering on field coaching sessions I will be involved in coaching discussions and mentoring our academy players.\u2019\n\nAcademy chief Neil Bath said: \u2018We are delighted to be welcoming John back to Cobham in a role that will involve coaching and mentoring the next generation of young players in our Academy.\n\n\u2018It goes without saying that John\u2019s experience in the game, both as a world-class player and more recently as an assistant coach in the Premier League, will be invaluable for everyone in the building.\n\n\u2018He will be a great mentor for our players and a fantastic asset to our coaching staff. We can\u2019t wait for him to get started.\u2019\n\nTerry can give Chelsea youngsters a first-hand insight into what is required to move from the youth setup to the first team squad, having made the same leap during his career after joining the club\u2019s academy as a 14-year-old.\n\nHe went onto make 717 appearances for the Blues, captaining them to five Premier League titles and a Champions League triumph in 2012.\n\nThe 41-year-old is hoping to follow his former England team-mates in carving out a career in management. It was reported earlier this week that Terry was interested in several Championship roles but was \u2018politely let down\u2019.\n\nIt is understood that a second tier club with a low budget does not appeal to the Blues legend, and he would rather take on a project with enough financial backing to allow him to develop his vision and identity.\n\nThe 41-year-old still lives within a stone\u2019s throw from Chelsea\u2019s Cobham training base and it is reported that his close ties with former team-mates Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini \u2013 who occupy roles at the club \u2013 and academy director Bath, has helped him make a return to his old club.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "Obasanjo to Clark: Adjust, bad language does not show wisdom, maturity",
          "text": "Contrary to claims by Chief Edwin Clark, former President Olusegun Obasanjo said he never at any time sabotaged the interests of the Niger Delta region.\n\nBesides, the former Nigerian leader said the natural resources found in every part of Nigeria belonged to the country and not a part of it.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s position came as a direct response to an open letter by Clark, leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF)and Chairman Board of Trustees Ijaw National Congress(INC).\n\nClark attacks OBJ\n\nChief Clark took on Obasanjo in Abuja over the latter\u2019s recent attack on National Secretary INC Ebipamowei Wodu at a peace and security parley convened by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa.\n\nAt the event, Obasanjo made utterances believed not be in the interest of the Niger Delta region on resource control.\n\nSpecifically, the former Nigerian leader said oil found in the Niger Delta region does not belong to the people of the Niger Delta.\n\nIn the letter entitled, \u2018My disappointment over your unprovoked outburst against the people of the Niger Delta region,\u2019 Clark said: \u201cThis is in spite of the environmental damages the region is suffering. Your Excellency did not deem it fit to empathise with the people of Nembe, Bayelsa State, in the recent pipeline explosion which has inflicted untold hardship on the people of the area and caused humungous damage to the area; the aquatic life is destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people can no longer engage in their major source of livelihood, fishing, can no longer be practiced. There is hunger; starvation is staring at the faces of people, including infants. The soot in Rivers State has assumed an alarming dimension with no hope of abating in the near future. The only thing people like Your Excellency, are thinking of, is how much a barrel of oil cost, how much revenue is continuously accruing to the country from the despoiled and ravaged Niger Delta region. A region where there is not even water to drink. To Your Excellency, the oil belongs to the country, while the sufferings belong to the people of the region.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised because your open hostility for the Niger Delta region was equally displayed when derivation went down as low as 0 per cent during your period as Military Head of State. Even the current 13 per cent, which happened reluctantly under your government later, came about after a sustained legal action to force you to implement what was provided for by the 1999 Constitution. The 2005 Political reform Conference recommended 18 per cent. But the South-South delegates to the conference led by me, were against it. As we demanded nothing less than 25 per cent for a start. When we saw the hostility against us, we staged a walk-out.\n\n\u201cThe 2014 National Conference recommended 18 per cent. Your Excellency\u2019s disdain and insincerity for the Niger Delta region has not in any way reduced. We still remember the fact that as President of the country, in 1999, you drafted the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) bill as one of your first Bills, but later refused to sign it into Law. You also decided not to pay the full entitlement to the Commission until you left office. You tried to kill the Brass Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), by bringing your proxy, Engr. Funso Kupolokun from retirement to be the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), to pursue the failed Olukola Liquefied Natural Gas project; as a result, Chevron withdrew its shares from the Brass LNG company,\u201d Clark, a former federal commissioner for information had written.\n\nObasanjo counters\n\nReplying the deluge of allegations however, Obasanjo, in yet another letter, said: \u201cI am not inconsistent, hypocritical, unstatesman, and nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey. You use your own yardstick to judge others. I fear God and I respect those who respect themselves and I hope it is about time you change from a tribesman to a statesman of character.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated December 28, 2021, the former president said: \u201cI believe one lesson that we all must appreciate that we have all learned in the last 61 years of our independence is that we all need to be civil to ourselves and occasionally put ourselves in the position of others.\n\n\u201cBad language does not show prudence, wisdom and maturity. I hope you will think and adjust. Negotiation achieves better results than dictation. I believe that we should be reformists rather than being pedantic with leave-it or take-it attitude. Together, I also believe Nigeria can be fixed and mended for the benefit of today and tomorrow on the basis of give and take.\n\n\u201cIf we all demand what we consider as our rights without yielding and with unbending stature, we will be wrong and record failure at the end of the day. Reform is a continuous exercise but relatively slow in achieving results. Revolution for sea-change may rarely happen and then we may continue to languish in frustration and regret with dire judgement of posterity.\u201d\n\nOn the allegations that he was anti-Niger Delta, Obasanjo faulted the claim.\n\nHe said: \u201cRather, I have always picked points on leadership performance or policies and I will continue to do so. Even when a particular part of Nigeria decided not to vote for me and their leaders told me that in clear terms, I showed understanding and not anger or distraught and disabused their minds on what I believed they got wrong.\n\n\u201cAnd in subsequent elections, they voted for me. My records before, during and after the civil war in Nigeria Delta Region was without blemish and it was all goodwill to all the people of Nigeria and especially the people of the Niger Delta Region which was my theatre of operation during the Nigerian Civil War.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those who purchase crude oil from Nigeria enter into a contractual relationship with Nigeria, not with the Niger Delta. The territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein.\n\n\u201cNo territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Nigerian Constitution and international law. If there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today including the Niger Delta it is the Nigerian military backed by any other machinery that can be procured or established at the Federal level that will respond to any such threat.\n\n\u201cIn principle and practice, the position I have taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position,\u201d Obasanjo further stated.",

          "text": "The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu, has given further insight into the President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr Shehu said the move is part of efforts to protect the democracy of the nation and the President will do whatever he can to protect it.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stands to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nRELATED:\n\n[Electoral Bill] Buhari\u2019s Decision Not The End, Says Adesina\n\nBuhari To Sign 2022 Budget On Friday\n\nPresident Buhari had last Tuesday declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill over the direct primaries clause.\n\nIn a letter sent to the National Assembly, the President cited several issues with the clause, including legal, economic security challenges.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nAnother of his aides, Mr Femi Adesina had reiterated the concerns of the President, stating that he had sourced the opinions of several stakeholders before arriving at the decision.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true,\u201d Mr Shehu reiterated in his statement on Tuesday.\n\nRead his full statement below.\n\nIn Amending The Electoral Act, The Nation First, Always First For Mr. President\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\n\nThis is quite correct because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians. The President\u2019s Office has decided, therefore, to issue an official statement to make its position clear.\n\nNigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\nIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true.\n\nRather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over.\n\nAnd who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course, and who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties. At a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money.\n\nInevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history. Then again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear them again in 2023.\n\nUntil then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill. It is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\nTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games. Tell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is.",

The sound that returns reveals whether there is, for example, oil locked in the rock beneath.\n\nShell had begun surveying the 6,000-sq-km area at the beginning of December after an earlier court judgement said it could go ahead. In that case, the judge said that those who wanted to prevent the survey had not provided enough evidence to show the environmental harm.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Justice Bloem said that experts had testified to the damage the testing could cause and Shell had not sufficiently challenged that.\n\nKatherine Robinson from the non-governmental organisation Natural Justice said the ruling was a \u201chuge victory\u201d, but added that the \u201cstruggle is not over\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis decision is just the interdict.

Two other candidates refused to accept the results, citing alleged problems at polling stations without providing evidence.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, the 73-year-old Darboe said he did not consider the court\u2019s decision a personal loss, since the petition was dismissed on a procedural technicality rather than on the merit of its claims.\n\n\u201cWe have not lost anything because the petition was not dismissed based on merit but a mere technicality,\u201d Darboe said.\n\n\u201cWe should be proud of ourselves for what we have done and will continue to do for the country.\u201d\n\nIt alleged that 56-year-old Barrow or members of his National People\u2019s Party had offered villagers cash or gifts for votes and infiltrated the electoral commission.\n\nIt also charged that foreign nationals had illegally cast ballots, and that voting and the vote count itself were marred by irregularities.\n\nDarboe did not indicate whether he or his party would continue to challenge the election results. Supreme Court decisions are final and cannot be appealed.\n\nThe December vote marked the first election in the West African country, a former British colony of two million people, since Yahya Jammeh fled into exile in January 2017 after his surprise defeat at the ballot box.\n\nHe ruled for 22 years, presiding over a regime accused of a litany of abuses, including death squads and torture.\n\nThe United States has given its approval to the December 4 vote.\n\nIt says that the US and other observers had noted \u201csome minor procedural irregularities\u201d but the election was otherwise \u201cfree and fair\u201d.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s observer mission said The Gambia had made \u201cdemocratic headway\u201d as shown by \u201cwide voter participation and citizen engagement\u201d.\n\nThe EU and the US are pushing for The Gambia to enact wide-ranging electoral reform.\n\nBarrow has promised to set term limits and for presidents to be elected by an absolute majority rather than through the current first-past-the-post system.",
