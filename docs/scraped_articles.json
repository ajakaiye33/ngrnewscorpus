          "text": "By Godwin Oritse\n\nIN a bid to free the port access roads of the perennial gridlock, Nigeria\u2019s foremost shipping and cargo logistics services provider, Hull Blyth, has opened a rail hub at Wasimi, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State, for use by importers and exporters.\n\nThe Wasimi Rail Hub, which is the first of its kind in Nigeria, will allow shippers receive import containers from Apapa port, and also send export/empty containers to the port by rail.\n\nThe Managing Director of Hull Blyth, Mr. Christian Holm, who disclosed this in Lagos ysterday, said the new rail hub willsave shippers the hassles and high cost of transporting their containers to/from the port by road.\n\n\u201cWe started this project because we are concerned about the pains shippers go through in moving their boxes in and out of the Apapa port in Lagos due to the congestion on the port access road.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to inform all shippers in the southwest and other parts of Nigeria that they no longerhave to go through the pains of trucking their containers to Apapa. Just send it to us at Wasimi and we will gladly move it to Apapa port by rail.\n\n\u201cImporters should also simply hand over their consignments to us at Apapa port and we will move it by rail to Wasimi from where it will be moved to final destination.\n\n\u201cIt is time shippers took advantage of the rail services revived by the Federal Government and relieved themselves of the stress and high cost associated with road haulage,\u201d Mr. Holm said.\n\nThe Hull Blyth Managing Director said that empty containers returned to the Wasimi Rail Hub will not attract demurrage, as it will be deemed to have been returned to the shipping company.\n\n\u201cThe rail hub brings several benefits to the trading community and the Nigerian economy. In addition to reducing the cost associated with trucking containers by half, it will also save importers and their agents the money they spend on payment of demurrage.\n\n\u201cThis is because we have agreed with shipping lines that containers delivered to the WasimiRail Hub from any part of the country will be deemed to returned to the shipping company and will not attract demurrage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said rail hub has commenced full operation, as the first train of both export and empty containers has been successfully delivered to APM Terminals at the Apapa port \u201cwithin only hours of transit from Wasimi\u201d.\n\nHolm said the Wasimi Rail Hub will save importers, exporters and agents as much as 50 per cent of logistics costs, since it is much cheaper to move goods by train.\n\nHe said the Wasimi Rail Hub is the precursor to a Dry Port, which is already under construction. When completed, the Dry Port, will have capacity to handle up to 7,000 TEUs and will be fully connected to Apapa port by rail.\n\nA beneficiary of the first train service, MsDedeYebovi of Quinet International expressed satisfaction with the ease of moving export from Ogun State by rail to Apapa port. She was particularly impressed that the service saved her company cost and provided faster transit when compared to road haulage.\n\nWith many years of experience and solid reputation as a multi-sector ship agent and cargo logistics services provider, Hull Blyth prides itself on the deliveryof operational excellence and as a reliable partner for supply chain management.",

          "text": "By Godwin Oritse\n\nTHE management of the Associated Port Marine Development Company (APMDC), has denied allegations of arbitrary charges and charging in foreign currency levelled against it by the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC).\n\nRecall that the council had shutdown the company\u2019s terminal over allegations of non-compliance with regulatory directives and other arbitrary charges.\n\nREAD ALSO:PDP crisis: Reps split over Secondus\n\nThe council further alleged that APMDC had been issued several notices to address infractions ranging from charging in foreign exchange to non-compliance with approved nomenclature of charges such as transport adjustment charges,\n\nnon-vessel-operating carriers, outright disregard of terms of mediation reached at NSC and unresolved complaints of over one and half years, among others.\n\nIn a statement, APMDC Group Head, Human Resources and Public Affairs, Mr Olise-Emeka Nwachukwu said its charges are not arbitrary but operate one of the most competitive tariffs in the market.\n\nAccording to Nwachukwu, the company said its charges structure is determined by high cost of delivering groupage containers from discharge ports or off docks to its bonded terminal/warehouse.\n\nHe further explained that Transport Adjustment Factor-TAF being a bill back costs, is one example of excessive costs of delivering groupage containers to her bonded warehouse/terminal.\n\nAccording to APMDC, \u201cAPMDC charges structure is determined by high cost of delivering groupage containers from discharge ports or off docks to its Bonded Terminal/Warehouse. Transport Adjustment Factor-TAF being a bill back costs, is one example of excessive costs of delivering our groupage containers to our bonded warehouse/terminal. APMDC is an experienced Nigerian-Global Shipping/Logistics player with over 16years of extensive trading knowledge in the Nigerian Maritime.\u201d\n\nHe said the company\u2019s record of integrity is impeccable adding that it has contributed a lot to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cApart from providing employment to Nigerians, the taxes our industry players pay to both Local, State and Federal Governments, our businesses units are also revenue channels for the Nigerian Economic through Billions to Trillions of Naira that are generated yearly via Customs import duties/taxes and levies hence we are major economic contributors, therefore, we should be applauded instead of being maligned. APMDC makes bold to say that, we are contributors to the over One Trillion-naira revenue generated declared recently by Customs for the first half of the year and cannot be tagged as economic saboteurs, \u201che said.\n\nHe the NSC\u2019s action is subjudise and the matter is currently pending at an appellate court.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that NSC shutting down the activities of APMDC, acted in flagrant disregard of the pending case at the Court of Appeal where these contending issues are before the honourable court, \u201che said.\n\nSpeaking on the company\u2019s charging in foreign currency, APMDC boss said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in 2015 grouped their operation among one of the services that can charge in foreign currency.\n\nHe further stated that the charges collected in foreign currency were not for local services .\n\n\u201cRegarding \u2018Trans-shipment Port Dues\u2019, other charges collection in FOREX, and NSC\u2019s allegations of APMDC committing financial infractions, there has never been any infraction, as the said charges collected were not for local services rendered. Trans-shipment operations and its associated costs do not occur at a \u201cDestination Port of Lagos but at a \u201cMid Transit Port\u201d in the course of the container journey between load and discharge ports.\n\n\u201cTrans-shipment port dues as its titled, simply defines and makes clear the nature of transaction for those who understand the international shipping business dynamics. Besides, CBN as the official financial/economic regulator of the country has exempted operators in the maritime and aviation sector where APMDC plays, to make payments/receive payments in foreign currencies. The same circular has been reaffirmed recently as still extant by CBN, hence APMDC has not committed any infractions as alleged, \u201cHe explained.\n\nAlso speaking, the Deputy Manager, Shipping of APMDC, Rachael Monye said Shippers Council\u2019s is uninterested about operators plights and industry inherent challenges that drive charges to customers.\n\nShe also accused the council of fees imposition without consideration or recourse to high costs of delivering the services.\n\nShe said, \u201cwe must put out there clearly that the major bane of contention to all operators, is that NSC tries to fix prices which negates healthy competitiveness amongst players, indeed an action that is non-compliant in itself and also against standard international commercial/business norms.\n\n\u201cTo the fact that, NSC imposes tariffs, fixes amounts to charge to customers, on operators without recourse to obvious industry challenges that drive our costs and charge structure leaves very bitter taste in the mouth of industry players and our concern is that this action will discourage investors and will also run businesses to a grind, \u201cshe stated.\n\nMonye, further called on the industry regulators to understand that the business of shipping especially the NVOCC is a multiparty and multilateral business involving multiple stakeholders hence must be fair and balanced in their regulatory functions, which we have never denied them. The customers themselves are our own creations, which underpins the more reason to resolve their issues within possible realms and regulators should be objective as well as fair in their judgement.\n\n\u201cThese businesses worth hundreds of millions to billions of Naira investment are in existence to ameliorate financial burdens for importers and create ease of doing business whilst offering mid-range cost effective supply chain solutions to the SMEs but at the same time, the need for returns on investments, sustainability and profitability of these platforms cannot be undermined or played down on a platter of regulations.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we are offering is critical and beneficial to both private and public sector businesses especially the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises-SMEs which is the fulcrums of growth in our country\u2019s economy. We believe that the roles we players are pivotal to the emergence, growth and sustainability of the SMEs hence we should be commended and encouraged as we bridge the gap between airfreight and full container imports option of the average businesses entities avoiding high airfreight, full Ocean freight rates, \u201cshe said.",

          "text": "The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has expressed delight at the many ways the administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State is promoting the spirit of \u2018one Nigeria\u2019 through the display of cultural identities of different ethnic groups in the country.\n\nThe Interior Minister, who spoke during a Gala Night organized in his honour by Gov. Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, said he was highly impressed that the cultural display, decorations and attires (cowry, etc.) worn by some Enugu dignitaries such as the immediate past President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, at the event, depicted the spirit of love and one Nigeria, stressing that such demonstrations are what the country needs to make steady progress.\n\nAregbesola was in Enugu for the inauguration of the new office of Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Enugu State Command, located at Kilometre 5, Enugu-Abakiliki Expressway, Emene, Enugu.\n\nWelcoming the Minister and his entourage, including the Comptroller-General of NIS, Muhammad Babandede, Gov. Ugwuanyi disclosed that he was glad that the office was finally inaugurated \u201cdespite all the challenges the Command encountered during the preparation for this event\u201d.\n\nThe Governor pointed out that the NIS office complex in Enugu was torched by arsonists during the nationwide #EndSARS protests, two days to its scheduled inauguration.\n\nGov. Ugwuanyi stated that his administration, acting on the recommendation of the state\u2019s Administrative Inquiry into the hijack of the #EndSARS protests by miscreants, gave financial support to facilitate the Command\u2019s relocation to the new office.\n\n\u201cI therefore congratulate you on today\u2019s successful commissioning of the new office of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Enugu State Command, in spite of the challenges.\n\n\u201cHonourable Minister, the Government and good people of Enugu State extend their compliments to you, on the far-reaching reforms that your leadership has engendered in the Federal Government Agencies under your watch.\n\n\u201cNigerian Immigration Service, one of the Paramilitary Services under the superintendence of the Ministry of Interior, has always availed the state quality services and advisories on migration trends especially those that have implication for the State\u2019s Internal Security, through the Enugu State Command of the Service. Enugu State Government is indeed pleased with this cooperation and synergy.\n\n\u201cFinally, it is my profound honour and great privilege to welcome you to the Coal City State and I invite you to enjoy its serene ambience and hospitable people while wishing you a memorable stay,\u201d the Governor said in an address at the event.\n\nOther Enugu dignitaries at the event include the Deputy Governor, Hon. Mrs. Cecilia Ezeilo; the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Edward Ubosi; former Governor of old Anambra State, Senator (Dr.) Jim Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo; State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon. Augustine Nnamani; former Minister of Power, Prof. Chinedu Nebo; former Minister of Aviation, Amb. Mrs. Fidelia Njeze, President, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Enugu State Chapter, Prof. Fred Eze and Chairman, Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council, HRH Igwe Amb.

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri; Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki; Okey Sampson, Umuahia; Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu; Obinna Odogwu, Awka, and Aloysius Attah, Onitsha\n\nThe every Monday sit-at-home called by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to press for the unconditional release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, by the Federal Government is eliciting mixed reactions across Igbo land, following its debut, last Monday, August 9. Kanu is facing trial for charges bordering on treason after his rendition from Kenya by Nigerian security agencies. But IPOB has vowed to continue to call for a sit-at-home every Monday until he is released.\n\nReports from our correspondents show that last Monday\u2019s exercise was characterized by loss of lives, destruction of property and disruption of lives, especially the National Examinations Council (NECO) exams in some parts of Igbo land. From Aba to Nnewi, Ohaozara to Enugu-Ezike, Onitsha to Enugu, sad tales continue to roll in as people lick their wounds.\n\nAs Igbo mull the experience, opinions are divided as to the possibility of sustaining the every Monday sit-at-home order. Reports from across the region show that many feel that IPOB should discard the order and come up with a more effective strategy. But if they must go on with the order, some think that they should limit it to the days that Kanu\u2019s case would come up in court while others feel that it should be moved to other days except Monday. We present a state-by-state situation of things as people count their losses after last Monday\u2019s exercise.\n\nENUGU\n\nIn various communities in Enugu-Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area, Enugu State, masked men wielding assorted weapons invaded schools, markets, and roadside stalls and left in their trail, tears, sorrows and blood.\n\nRiding on motorcycles, they stormed Community Secondary School, Umuida, and snatched bags containing the day\u2019s question paper and answer sheets from the supervisor, as candidates were getting ready to commence the NECO exams. Teachers and pupils scattered and ran for safety in different directions as soon the gunmen entered the exam hall. At Umuagama Secondary School, they robbed teachers and students of their phones and other valuables at gunpoint, tore the question papers and writing materials before setting the materials ablaze in the school premises.\n\nAt Imufu Secondary School, they unleashed violence on anyone in sight, beat up the Principal, Mrs Cecelia Idoko, and hit another teacher identified as Mr. Ogbonna with an axe, inflicting serious bodily injuries on him. At the time of this report, the teacher was still struggling for his life in an undisclosed hospital.\n\nTraders at Nkwo market, Aji community, lost their wares as the masked men destroyed goods and various food items. The attacks also continued in other communities in the area like Umuogbo-Agu, Okpo, Ogrute and Isiugwu. Though the exercise could be said to have received full compliance in Enugu State, right now some doubts exist as to its weekly continuation. Residents who spoke to Saturday Sun said it will not be in the interest of the region\u2019s economic and social wellbeing.\n\nChuka Ozor, a building material dealer believes that \u201cpeople will not obey this every Monday order thing; it will not work here again.\u201d His reason: \u201cWe are traders in this part of the country and every hour matters a lot to us. Look, my brother\u2019s son could not take the NECO exam last Monday in Anambra. Please, they need to think of a better way of making the Federal Government feel our grievances about Kanu than causing ourselves more hardship and pains.\u201d\n\nA dealer in toilet tissues in Enugu, would want Igbo leaders to meet with the authorities in Abuja and negotiate Kanu\u2019s release. A prominent Igbo man in Enugu who pleaded anonymity for fear of being physically attacked, warned: \u201cWhile I am in support of the struggle for our liberation, I refuse to accept some of their decisions and actions. Just look at that Monday sit-at-home, a day our children were to take a very important paper in the on-going NECO exams, Mathematics. Despite the pleas by our people and the reasonable views of Kanu\u2019s younger brother (Kanunta), they insisted on going ahead with the order and thereby causing their younger brothers and sisters a colossal damage. How do all these affect Aso Rock? Sit-at-home every Monday is a disaster and must not continue. I will suggest that our leaders dialogue with the Presidency to get freedom for Kanu.\u201d\n\nEBONYI\n\nUnconfirmed reports said about eight persons were killed by people suspected to be IPOB enforcers in the Ohaozara-Onicha axis of Ebonyi State during the August 9 sit-at-home. Cars, motorcycles and other property were also destroyed by the attackers. But Saturday Sun investigation shows that while residents of Ebonyi acknowledge the issue of the marginalization of Ndi Igbo, they think that resorting to sitting at home every Monday will amount to self-inflicted economic sabotage.\n\nNdubuisi Anyigor, a commercial bus driver advised the leadership of IPOB to be sensitive to the plight of ordinary people in the region. He noted that there was no wisdom in forcing people to stay at home and be killed by hunger.\n\nMrs. Eunice Ibeh, a petty trader in Abakaliki lamented the killings of Igbo people by their own brothers trying to enforce the sit-at-home orders. She feared that, going by the way Igbo youths are being killed by suspected IPOB sit-at-home enforcers, the zone may soon be devoid of able-bodied youths.\n\nIMO\n\nAt Aboh Mbaise, Imo State, two travellers were said to have burnt to death in a transport company\u2019s bus while two others were allegedly shot dead by gunmen along Nkwogu road, during last Monday\u2019s sit-at-home. Saturday Sun gathered that residents of Imo were not disposed to observing the order until reports of attacks in some other states filtered in.\n\nMany residents are civil servants; so, it was difficult to abide by the directives of IPOB the last time because of earlier warning issued to workers by government on the consequences of not showing up at work. Also, the traders regard Mondays as their peculiar day of sales. Some of them who spoke to our correspondent said they wished the directive were fixed for another day instead of Monday. However, ahead of next sit-at-home exercise, indications are that the people might decide to stay indoors or resist the order.\n\nANAMBRA\n\nIn Anambra, many residents said that they were not happy about the order, stating that it has not added any value to their economy. To them, the frequent lockdowns is like cutting one\u2019s nose to spite one\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nVice President (South East) of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Nnonyelu Onyibor, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t be dealing with ourselves believing that we are trying to get at people who don\u2019t like us. \u201cI agree but in a situation where a very small percentage of the people decide to bar people from going out to look for what to feed their children with, is condemnable. We know why we are agitating for Biafa but that is not enough reason to be destroying our own land. The Federal Government may decide not repair what they have destroyed.\u201d He called on the governors of the South East to get the youths actively involved in the discussions of issues affecting them as that, according to him, is the best way to stop their restiveness.\n\nA senior journalist, Achilleus Uchegbu believes that the most ideal thing for IPOB to do is not the destruction of life and property of Igbo people but to secure the services of the best lawyers to work to secure his release.\n\n\u201cIPOB advisers will do very well to help the group to rethink its strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is now very urgent. As it is, the fear of IPOB may not last for too long. Someday, those who fear that their businesses may be attacked by IPOB enforcers may develop a thick skin and decide to face their attackers. Market associations and trade groups may form their own vigilantes to stand up against any IPOB group that comes around to enforce orders. If the situation gets to that point, IPOB may be defeated by the people who will now see it as the enemy of their progress and survival.\u201d\n\nABIA\n\nA public servant, Boniface Igwe said inasmuch as he was not happy with the incarceration of the IPOB leader, he fears the order might be counter-productive. An industrialist who gave his name as Chief Udechukwu said the weekly sit-at-home may force many wealthy Igbo men and women to leave the zone for other places where their businesses can thrive. He, however, suggested that a sit-at-home could be imposed only on the day Kanu will be appearing in court.\n\nA trader, Ifeanyi Madu, said most traders in Aba would prefer to go to market on Mondays and remain at home for the rest of the week because Mondays, according to him, are when customers from outside Igbo land, including neighbouring Cameroun, come to buy goods.\n\nAn importer, Chief Onyebuchi Ikpa, said many of them took loans from banks, noting that the banks would not consider the sit-at-home days when computing days due for repayment.\n\nSome tricycle operators who spoke to Saturday Sun said that they took delivery of them on hire purchase arrangement and would need to recoup their losses. One of them, Eke Igu said they must make remittances for the \u201cGhost Mondays\u201d whether they worked or not. He advised that the sit-at-home order should be streamlined otherwise \u201ceven the enemies of the Igbo would be laughing at us, that we have turned the heat on ourselves.\u201d\n\nFamily of the IPOB leader begs for suspension of sit-at-home order\n\nEmmanuel Kanu, the younger brother to IPOB leader called for the suspension of the sit-at-home order, arguing that doing so will help to give the people a sense of belonging in the march for the actualization of the ideals of the struggle. But IPOB\u2019s spokesman, Emmanuel Powerful said no price was too much for the Igbo to pay in securing their freedom and release of IPOB leader, Kanu. He noted that Biafran children lost education throughout the 30 month of the civil war.",
          "summary": "As Igbo mull the experience, opinions are divided as to the possibility of sustaining the every Monday sit-at-home order.\nShe feared that, going by the way Igbo youths are being killed by suspected IPOB sit-at-home enforcers, the zone may soon be devoid of able-bodied youths.\nHowever, ahead of next sit-at-home exercise, indications are that the people might decide to stay indoors or resist the order.\nAn importer, Chief Onyebuchi Ikpa, said many of them took loans from banks, noting that the banks would not consider the sit-at-home days when computing days due for repayment.\nBut IPOB\u2019s spokesman, Emmanuel Powerful said no price was too much for the Igbo to pay in securing their freedom and release of IPOB leader, Kanu.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nEncomiums from past Nigerian leaders, including other notable Nigerians from all walks of life, poured in torrents on Thursday for former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida whose 80th birthday comes up on August 17th.\n\nThe event was the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Legacy Dialogue 2021 organised by the Ibrahim and Maryam Babangida Library and Museum.\n\nThe former leaders were former Military Heads of State, Generals Yakubu Gowon and Abdulsalami Abubakar respectively; former Interim Head of State, Chief Ernest Shonekan; former President Goodluck Jonathan and ex-Vice President Mohammed Nnamdi Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the physical event in Abuja were General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd); former Senate President, Senator David Mark; former Governor of Imo State and Senator Representing Imo West, Senator Rochas Okorocha; President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ambassador George Obiozor; Elder Statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu.\n\nAlso in attendance were former Minister of Information and National Orientation, Professor Jerry Gana; former Governor of Niger State, Mu\u2019azu Babangida Aliyu; former Minister of Education, Professor Tunde Adeniran; Emeritus Chairman, Daar Communications Plc, High Chief Raymond Aleogho Dokpesi; former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Sinatu Ojikutu, amongst others.\n\nIn his remarks, Gowon expressed delight that Aisha, daughter of Babangida, was able to organise the event to celebrate the 80th birthday of her father, an event which he said, dealt with various aspects of the activities of Babangida.\n\nGowon disclosed that he knew Babangida when he visited Bida Secondary School where Babangida was the head boy, to talk to the students to try to encourage them to join the army.\n\nGowon added that Babangida and others, about ten of them, later joined the army and did exceptionally well during his training programmes.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, when he became an officer, he served very loyally, he served with greater passion and did very well during the civil war, leading his men to fight in order to keep Nigeria one,\u201d Gowon said.\n\nGowon recalled that his younger brother who returned from the frontline, told him about his commander, Babangida, a very courageous soldier, a great leader who led from the front and did exceptionally well.\n\nHe said he was so impressed by the particular young officer that his late younger brother, Captain Isaiah Gowon, told him about to the extent that he sought for Babangida as his aide de camp.\n\nGowon expressed delight in the positions Babangida attained, saying that becoming his aide de camp seemed like an omen for Babangida as he became a General, Commander-in-Chief and Head of State, taking over Gowon\u2019s previous post.\n\nHe hailed Babangida\u2019s exploits in various areas of life, particularly in politics, as a president, in foreign affairs and particularly with his Option A4.\n\n\u201cSo, one can say that Ibrahim has done exceptionally well throughout his life. And as president, he happily gave the country quite a lot of good ideas for Nigeria to make progress, for Nigeria to continue in the oneness that is required of a state.\n\n\u201cI would like to say, really, Ibrahim Babangida, we are all very proud of you. You have done very well in your life and you have succeeded in the\u2026 Certainly, somebody that should be remembered, something should be created in memory of you,\u201d Gowon added.\n\nAlso speaking, Shonekan thanked God for the life of Babangida, noting that it has been a long journey.\n\nHe prayed God to continue to keep General Babangida in good health and bless his family, while also praying God to bless the country.\n\nOn his part, Abubakar hailed Babangida, disclosing that right from childhood, Babangida had showed qualities of leadership as he was made a monitor in his class right from the elementary school and head boy in the secondary school.\n\nAbubakar stated that after secondary school, Babangida joined the military and as an officer and gentleman, Babangida also displayed his leadership qualities.\n\n\u201cLeadership is about caring and it is about managing resources, people and personnel under you. He exhibited these leadership qualities even before he became an officer,\u201d Abubakar stated.\n\nAbubakar wished Babangida whom he said is his brother, his friend, commander-in-chief, head boy and prefect all the best as he celebrates his 80th birthday.\n\n\u201cI wish you continuous good health, Allah\u2019s guidance and all the best. Many happier returns.\n\n\u201cI am really happy to be associated with you. Since 79 years ago, we have been together and I hope we will have many more years to live together in good health. Congratulations and many happier returns,\u201d Abubakar stated.\n\nJonathan who was described as the youngest of the former leaders, received applause from the audience.\n\nIn his remarks, Jonathan said it was a pleasure for him and quite interesting, listening to different comments and testimonies since morning about the life, times and legacies of General Babangida.\n\nJonathan stated that Babangida has lived a very eventful life as a decorated military officer whom he said, was a patriot and a political leader.\n\n\u201cIn his military career, he was a key factor in uniting this country. He fought the civil war, he sustained injuries, and injury during wartime depends on the part of your body that you received the bullets. He could have died in the process. From there, he became the Head of State.\n\n\u201cSo, you would see clearly that he has paid his dues in terms of the unity of this country, keeping this country together.\n\n\u201cAs a military president, one thing about Babangida is that he recruited some of our best brains as members of his cabinet and I have been listening to some of them, some of their comments and we know that as at that time, even now, Babangida\u2019s team were among the best and he did very well,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nJonathan also hailed Babangida for the way he handled the nation\u2019s economy, foreign relations and internal security, passing a verdict that Babangida did very well.\n\nHe also stated that Babangida is a good and solid political leader who left office 28 years ago, but till today, anybody who is aspiring to hold a very high office, political office in the country, must go to Minna Hilltop.\n\nEulogizing Babangida, Sambo said clocking 80 years was indeed a milestone in the life of a man, especially under the significant marks of the great nation, Nigeria.\n\nSambo stated that since Nigeria\u2019s independence in 1960, IBB, as he is fondly called, remained one of the very few Nigerians who have had the privilege to serve his fatherland.\n\n\u201cHe did this with patriotism and sacrifice. While he served as Nigeria\u2019s president for eight years, his influence transcended the African continent and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe legacy of General Babangida are too numerous to be mentioned in a fora like this today. Nevertheless, the outstanding legacies of His Excellency, includes laying the foundation for the development and stability of Nigeria,\u201d Sambo said.\n\nSambo added that in the eight years Babangida led Nigeria, the country witnessed unprecedented infrastructural development, including the creation of 11 states and 136 local government areas.\n\nFocusing on the perception of Babangida amongst Nigerians, Mark who was Military Governor of Niger State and Minister of Communications during the Babangida regime, said there were prons and cons, noting that Babangida had supporters and those who have made up their minds that they would never believe in Babangida.\n\n\u201cAnd there are those who feel, like somebody said, they can be blindfolded, they will follow him to anywhere he decides to go,\u201d Mark said.\n\nWhile saying that the misconceptions were not surprising, Mark added that from general observation, one thing that was established at the event was that Babangida had a human heart, a feeling, a personal touch that he brought into governance.\n\n\u201cThe way he sympathise with people is unique and truly, it is very, very unique.\n\n\u201cFor people like me, I mean, he was like a protector, a mentor in the Armed Forces. And for so many of us, that is exactly what he is.\n\n\u201cSo, I think I am not surprised that there are people who, regardless of what he says or does, will believe him and there are those who will be against him,\u201d Mark also said.\n\nAlso, speaking, Oyinlola a former Governor of Osun State, in his tribute, praised Babangida for his uncommon humanity and generosity. He also said the former president was trusting.\n\nHe recalled an incident when he was going to write a promotional exam in Jos but missed the flight to his destination.\n\n\u201cThere was a mixed up in the departure time. When I got to the airport and learnt that the flight had gone, I gave up hope. However, I reported to General Babangida who was my commander. He sent for his driver and gave him a pass to drive me in his staff car to Jos. I was shocked. He told me the car was all mine and wished me safe journey. That was how I got to Jos and took my promotional exam,\u201d Oyinlola said.\n\nOyinlola recalled another incident when he was serving at the Division 2 in Enugu.\n\nHe said Babangida visited Enugu as military president then and, during a reception ceremony at Okpara Square, beckoned on him.\n\nAccording to him, when he walked to where Babangida sat, the president whispered to him to go get him pepper fruits.\n\n\u201cI drove to the market with my orderly to look for pepper fruits. We found them and bought. On return, we washed them and out in a bowl. I took the bowl containing pepper fruits to the President. On presentation, he took one and put in his mouth and ate. Immediately, I took one and put in my mouth. This was a President who took fruit I brought without hesitation. I had to also eat to show the fruit was safe.\n\n\u201cGeneral Babangida told me there was no need for me eating the pepper fruit, saying that if he was afraid I would poison him, he wouldn\u2019t have sent me.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the occasion, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, dismissed negative attributes by some Nigerians to Babangida\u2019s reputation over the years.\n\nHe specifically absolved Babangida of the blame of the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election and the alleged missing $12 billion oil windfall while he held sway as military head of state.\n\nIn a surprised appearance towards the end of the event, Gen Babangida, clothed in agbada, expressed gratitude to Dokpesi, who chaired the occasion and to the former leaders and other Nigerians who participated in the programme.\n\n\u201cI want to convey my gratitude to all of you who have found time to be here today,\u201d said the elated former military president.",

When they started, they were very hard on me and push me to a limit you never expected human to still be resilient but I give God the glory because I remain there as a believer believing that the God I serve will always be there for me.\n\nIdris pointed out that after the first two days, he was later fed with bread and water as the only food under a very hash and humiliating condition, stressing that he never wished anybody to go through such treatment.\n\n\u201cI was asking them if what they were doing is welcome in the eyes of Allah, gradually, instead of breaking me, I started breaking them. After then they started giving me bread, water, they untied me and use the only trampoline they had to cover me during rain while they stayed under the rain. They began to show concern, I kept talking to them and in the long run, they said I should go and reunite with my family, \u201d he said.\n\nHe stated further that at a point, the kidnappers became remorseful and they began to shed tears when he was leaving them adding that, \u201cI held onto the leader and told him that I forgive them for all the humiliations they have taken me through.

          "text": "*Wants party\u2019s governorship candidate, running mate in last election sworn in\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe filing of a suit, yesterday, in Abuja, by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking the sack of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni and his deputy, Idi Gubana, could mean more trouble for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as momentum gathers ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe party\u2019s woes took a worrisome dimension in July, when a minority judgement of the Supreme Court held that Buni violated the 1999 Constitution by performing the duties of a sitting Governor and Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee \u2013 both executive positions.\n\nThe judgement has since July 28 continued to tear the party further apart alongside pro-Buni and anti-Buni tendencies, with the Minister of State for Niger Delta and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Festus Keyamo, warning about future disasters if Buni was not immediately removed as chairman of APC.\n\nKeyamo and others, like Senators Babafemi Ojudu and Ita Enang, had raised concerns about future elections, particularly, in a situation, where the convention to elect new leaders of the APC was conducted under the Yobe State governor.\n\nAlthough the pro-Buni group within the party has continued to maintain that the Supreme Court judgement did not fault the chairman\u2019s position as governor and, hence, passed a vote of confidence on his committee to proceed with its planned congresses and national convention.\n\nWhile the crisis rocking the party had been mainly internal, a new dimension was introduced yesterday with the filing of a suit by the PDP leadership, this time seeking the removal of Buni as governor of Yobe State, over alleged breach of constitutional provisions barring a sitting governor from holding two executive offices at the same time.\n\nApart from Buni, PDP, citing section 187(1) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, also sought the removal of Gubana from office as deputy governor.\n\nPDP, in the suit dated and filed August 12, specifically alleged that Buni violated Section 183 of the constitution, when as a governor he accepted to serve as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) of APC had last year appointed Buni and others to manage the affairs of the party for a period of six months, which has been extended twice. Buni\u2019s appointment was sequel to the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of APC. This was after Oshiomhole was suspended from his ward in the build-up to the Edo 2020 governorship poll.\n\nBoth the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had held that Oshiomhole, having been suspended by his ward, could not continue to preside over the activities of APC.\n\nAlthough Oshiomhole did not challenge the dissolution of the NWC then, some aggrieved party members had approached the court seeking to stop the Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nWhile the party would be battling on the one hand to legitimise the Buni-led committee, the Yobe State governor, on the other hand, would be battling to save his office as governor.\n\nOutside Buni and Gubana, other defendants in the suit filed by Umar Damagum and Baba Aji included the APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIn the suit filed on their behalf by their lawyer, Chief Emeka Etiaba, SAN, the plaintiffs insisted that Buni ceased to be a governor from the moment he accepted to act as APC caretaker committee chairman.\n\nAmong the issues raised for determination by the court were, \u201cWhether the 1st Defendant did not breach the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Regublic of Nigeria 1999 as amended) when as the governor of Yobe State he accepted the 3rd Defendant\u2019s appointment as its Caretaker Committee Chairman and proceeded to occupy the office?\n\n\u201cWhether the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Charmin of the 3rd Defendant, has not ceased to hold the office of the govermor of Yobe State, having regards to the provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)?\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court Eyitayo Olayinka Jegede and Anor And Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Appeal No: SC 448/2021 delivered on July 28, 2021 whether the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has not ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe \u2018State?\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the clear provisions of Section 187 (1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeran 1999 (a amended) and the state of the law whether the 2nd Defendant can lawfully occupy the office of the governor or deputy governor of \u2018Yobe State upon the cessation of the 1st Defendant\u2019s occupation of the Yobe State governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs submitted that if the questions were answered in the affirmative, the court should declare \u201cthat the 1st Defendant breached the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) when as the governor of Yobe State, he accepted 3rd Defendant\u2019s appointment as the Caretaker \u2018Committee Chairman and proceeded to occupy the office\n\n\u201cA Declaration that the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe State having regard to the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended).\n\n\u201cA Declaration that having regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court on Eyitayo Olayinka Jegede and Anor And Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Appeal No SC 449/2021 delivered on the 28 day of July 2021, the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker \u2018Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe State\n\n\u201cA Declaration that the actions of the Ist Defendant as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant while he remains the governor of Yobe State are wrongful null and void,\n\n\u201cA Declaration that having regard to the clear provisions of Section 187 {1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the state of law, the 2nd Defendant cannot lawfully occupy the office of the governor or deputy governor of Yobe State upon cessation af the 1st Defendant\u2019s occupation of the office of the governor of Yobe State\n\n\u201cAn Order directing the Chief Judge of Yobe State or any other relevant judge in his absence to immediately swear in the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs as governor and Deputy governor of Yobe State, the offices having become vacant.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Iwuanyawu: June 12 annulment not his sole decision, he didn\u2019t kill Dele Giwa\n\n*Akilu: Vasta was killed because he wasn\u2019t innocent of foiled \u201986 coup\n\n*Abubakar: He\u2019s needlessly misunderstood\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nSome elder statesmen and eminent Nigerians, many of whom played key roles in the administration of former Military President Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, have come out to address some of the age-long thoughts about his leadership, with a view to owning their own narrative.\n\nThose who took the pain to explain away some of the issues that have stigmatised Babangida included a former Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar; a member of the defunct Armed Forces Ruling Council, Gen. Haliru Akilu, and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT), Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu.\n\nThey addressed issues as the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the mindless killing of a renowned journalist, Dele Giwa, and the killing of Mamman Vasta in the wake of the foiled 1996 coup.\n\nThey all spoke at the maiden edition of IBB legacy dialogue, which is one of the products of the IBB and Maryam Babangida Presidential Library. The colloquium was designed as part of events to mark Babangida\u2019s 80th birthday coming up next Tuesday, August 17.\n\nGenerally, the speakers called on leaders across the country to emulate the inclusive leadership qualities of the former military president in managing Nigeria\u2019s multi-ethnic polity and raised concern over the retrogression of intellectualism in governance.\n\nThey also expressed concern about poor handling of Nigeria\u2019s multi-ethnic nature, and set the agenda for the future. They said future leaders of the country should have a broad network of friends across the country in order to ascertain the true situation of things across Nigeria.\n\nReflecting on his relationship with Babangida, Iwuanyanwu, who echoed the need for inclusive government, however, defended IBB over June 12 annulment and described the news that he killed Dele Giwa as fake.\n\nIwuanyanwu stated, \u201cI am not worried about the stories about IBB. A leader must be swift to respond to false comments about him. That story on Dele Giwa is fake news. not properly responded to.\n\n\u201cOn the cancellation of the June 12 election, none of the council members protested or resigned, because of the cancellation of the result. Maybe after this, the narrative will improve.\u201d\n\nIwuanyanwu, who said IBB impressed him as a friend and leader in many dimensions, hailed his inclusive leadership abilities in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria.\n\nWhile appreciating his leadership qualities, Iwuanyanwu said, \u201cWhen you assume leadership of a multi-ethnic country, you must carry everybody along.\u201d\n\nHe urged secessionist groups to desist from stoking the embers of war, noting that having experienced war just like Babangida, it was not a tea party.\n\nIwuanyanwu said, \u201cWe are warning the younger ones causing trouble, it is not a tea party. I fought in the war and he (Babangida) fought and we suffered injuries.\u201d He added that when Babangida came to power, he assured those who fought the war on the side of Biafra of inclusion and \u201che made it real.\u201d\n\nIwuanyanwu explained, \u201cHe (Babangida) had people of all parts working for him. It is an example other leaders must learn. He didn\u2019t neglect any ethnic group; he carried them all along. To have confidence in a people called rebels is why Igbos have confidence in IBB. He married our daughter. He gave us respect.\u201d\n\nThe PDP BoT member recalled that Babangida founded the Raw Materials Development Council in order to address the way foreigners were exporting raw materials from the country.\n\nRecalling how the former president spent the whole day at his hometown in Imo State, when he buried his father, Iwuanyanwu said, \u201cHe is an excellent leader. He is being misrepresented. All leaders are misrepresented. But it is for the leader to tell his story if he does not tell it others will tell it for him. He should say with joy that I came, saw and conquered.\u201d\n\nAkilu, on his part, defended IBB over the killing of Vasta.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for those bringing the case of Vasta, they should go and dig deeper and find out what happened. We were there and we had a tribunal that looked into the case. If Gen Vasta were innocent, nobody would have convicted him. Unfortunately, he was the most senior officer behind the attempted coup in 1986. So, people should not jump to conclusions.\u201d\n\nAkilu said he was attracted to Babangida during the civil war, when Babangida, as a young military officer, defended a junior officer from a bully military officer.\n\n\u201cThere was an incident that attracted me to him. He stood up for a junior officer, who was being bullied. He cared for the junior officers working under him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described Babangida as a gifted person, who is kind to a fault. Akilu recalled how the former military president gave out his only car to a friend, who needed it.\n\nAkilu said, \u201cHis loyalty to his friends is legendary. He will never betray you no matter what. He will never forsake his friends. If you are his friend, he will never abandon you.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the failure of successive administrations to follow in the steps of Babangida in building more barracks for the military so that the military will have comfort.\n\n\u201cI thought that successive administrations would build more barracks but no additional barracks have been built for the military.\u201d\n\nAkilu decried the lack of maintenance of the federal secretariat, which was built by the Babangida regime.\n\nOn the relocation of the federal capital territory from Lagos to Abuja, Akilu said, \u201cHe was courageous to take the right decision at the right place and time even when many of us were saying it was not the right time.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution on \u201chow he built his tribe\u201d, Abubakar, extolled the virtues of the former military president and underscored the need for leaders in the country to carry everybody along in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar, while underscoring the leadership qualities that endeared Babangida to many Nigerians, said, \u201cOnce you are a leader, everybody is yours. You are supposed to look after the welfare of all of them.\u201d\n\nAbubakar, who recalled his early childhood years with Babangida, said the former military president displayed leadership qualities from a young age, serving as class monitor in primary school and later as head boy in secondary school.\n\nRegretting that the Babangida was one of the most misunderstood Nigerians, Abubakar noted that Babangida has the love of Nigeria at heart.\n\nHe reflected on the institutions established under the Babangida administration, adding that Nigerians are now reaping the fruits of the numerous agencies created under his watch.\n\nThe former head of state said, \u201cIBB has the love of the country in his heart. He is one of the most misunderstood Nigerians but by and large, you can see that what he has established over the years; we are seeing the benefits. Abuja is one of the greatest and fastest growing capitals in the world. He is quite accommodating and generous to a fault. He can deprive himself to make sure someone is okay.\u201d\n\nOther dignitaries at the event included former governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu; former Senate President David Mark; former Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana; former Minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran; media mogul and Chairman of Daar Communication Group, Raymond Dopkesi; and Gen Olagunsoye Oyinlola.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

What a heartbreaking news, that my friend for well over 60 years has passed to the great beyond. If every Nigerian have the attributes of Joda, Nigeria will have been better than what it is now.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda by his feature did not need to tell you is a Fulani man, but, in everything I know he did, he lived not just as a Fulani man, he lived, he worked and he laboured as a true Nigerian. They are not many like him, and that was what strengthens our relationship since 1959,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nSee Also Breaking News BREAKING: Elder Statesman Who Headed Buhari\u2019s 2015 Transition, Ahmed Joda Dies\n\nHe said that they met when he was a Second Lieutenant in the Nigeria Army and Joda was a Deputy Chief Information Officer in the Federal Civil service.\n\nObasanjo recalled that the effort of Joda and his other Super Permanent Secretaries as they were fondly called in the then civil service saved Nigeria in 1966.\n\nAccording to the former President, \u201cI know that if not for people like Joda and other Senior Permanent Secretaries as they were called Super Permanent Secretary as at that time, after the second upheaval of 1966, after the first upheaval we would have had Nigeria broken into pieces. Because Araba was bent on having Nigeria divided.\n\n\u201cBut, it was Ahmed Joda and other Super Permanent Secretaries (senior civil servants) like Philip Asiodu, Liman Ciroma, Alison Ayida who prevailed not to have Nigeria broken up.\n\n\u201cWell, Dear Ahmed, you have served your family, your community. You have served your country and indeed humanity, you have done your best, including working for the transition between the Buhari administration and Jonathan administration.\n\n\u201cYou have done your best working with me on the progress and programme of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. You have done your best on becoming the Chancellor of Bells University. We love you, but God loves you best. Rest permanently in the bosom of Allah,\u201d Obasanjo added.",

          "text": "Rebecca Enonchong, one of Africa\u2019s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, is reportedly set to appear before a court in her home country, Cameroon, on Thursday after she was arrested on Tuesday, August 10.\n\nThis is according to Edith Kah Walla, the leader of the Cameroon People\u2019s Party (CPP).\n\nWalla had earlier revealed in a series of tweets that the Cameroonian entrepreneur had been arrested and was being held at the Gendarmerie Legion (a police station) in Douala, apparently by government order and without any arrest warrant.\n\nAccording to Walla, the United States-based Enonchong was called to the Gendarmerie for a case involving her family.\n\nWhile meeting with the Attorney General (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), she reportedly asked that her cases be handled by one investigator rather than two. The request was considered an \u201coutrage \u00e0 magistrat\u201d (contempt of court) by the AG, who ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nHello All!\n\n\n\n1st, Congrats for amazing mobilization today.\n\n2nd, stay mobilized. @africatechie is still under arrest.

She sits on the boards of many corporations including AfriLabs Foundation, ActivSpaces, Digital Africa, WHO Foundation, Eneza Education, Suguba, Djibouti Telecom, US Exim SAAC, and the UNECA Center for Digital Excellence.\n\nEnonchong is an advisor to Venture Capital for Africa (VC4Africa), the largest online community dedicated to entrepreneurs and investors building African companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn 2017, she was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans in Science, Tech & Innovation by the New African Magazine and Jeune Afrique\u2019s 50 Most Influential Africans.

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With the work our epidemiological team has been doing, we know that the Delta variant is already with us here in Nigeria. We are beginning to witness an increase in COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\n\u201cThis visit is to check our response arrangements and emergency facilities, which we used for the first and second waves of COVID-19 to make sure that they are in shape and are ready for the response that we are currently planning for the third wave.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State COVID-19 response team has been reactivated; l am the chairman of the team and the deputy governor is the chairman of the Technical Committee.

For now, we are expecting the Moderna vaccine, which is different from the AstraZeneca we had received before.\n\n\u201cYou cannot take different doses of the vaccines.

The state and federal governments have tried to ensure that we have the two doses for vaccination.\u201d\n\nHe further urged: \u201cIn the data that we are monitoring, we have about 20,600 Edo citizens that took the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine and have not taken the second dose.

          "title": "When Oredo Corpers Defiled Rain to Keep Benin City Clean \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt poured cats and dogs on Thursday, 8th July, 2021 in Benin City. Amidst the rain, fully kitted Corps members were spotted on many streets of the town walking in the rain encouragingly in groups as they carried out sensitization exercise on environmental sanitation in a bid to key into Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s Urban Renewal Program for healthy environment and create awareness on sustainable environmental management and regeneration.\n\nThey were visibly drained from the rain but they had inner strengths that kept them going. They were quick to remind any colleague who mumbles from fatigue of the famous NYSC anthem lines that; \u201d under the sun or in the rain, with dedication and selflessness\u2026\u201d This brought back camp memories that put smiles on the faces of the young patriots. Now they understood the anthem they sang every day during the three weeks camp orientation exercise to actually mean that they signed up to the clarion call irrespective of the atmospheric condition.\n\nBut the rainy Thursday sensitization exercise was just a prelude to the sanitation exercise that would come on Saturday, 17th July, 2021 National Environmental Sanitation Day which NYSC set aside for Corps members to carry out environmental sanitation and sensitization in their various host communities.\n\nThe disciplinary NYSC officials in Oredo have not doubt instilled discipline in the serving Corps member which has put the Corps members always on the go when duty calls. So when the Corpers\u2019 Liaison Officer (CLO), Afemi Samson posted a reminder on the WhatsApp group that reads:\n\n\u201cAttention Corps members, there will be a National Environmental Sanitation Day! Which will hold on Saturday, the 17th of July, 2021.Corpers are advised to come out in large numbers to clean their environment, and also sensitize the people on Sanitation! Irrespective of your CDS group or where you stay, you are all advised to participate in making your environment clean\u2026\u201d they were not dazed a bit!\n\nOn Saturday, 17th July, corpers serving within Benin metropolis were spotted in every nook and cranny of the town carrying out sanitation. From cutting of grasses to disposing of waste bins. As usual what ordinarily would have been tiring turned out to be fun filled as they exhibited a high level of team spirit on the exercise.\n\nCommunity Development Service (CDS) is one of the four cardinal programmes of NYSC in which corps members contribute positively to the development of their host communities throughout the period of national service. Corps members are expected to use one day in a week for group CDS activities. They are not expected to attend duties in their places of Primary assignment on CDS days. Such days are dedicated to the execution of projects and programmes that will improve the living conditions of their host communities.\n\nThere are 16 CDS groups, one of which is Enviromental Protection & Sanitation group (NEMA/NESREA vanguard) that carries out sanitation on weekly basis but to commemorate the epochal National Environmental Sanitation Day, Oredo Corps members irrespective of the CDS groups all turned out en masse to carry out the sanitation exercise.\n\nIt is worthwhile mentioning that since its inception in 1973, the National Youth Service Corps has been making great contributions in the social, political and economic transformation of the nation.\n\nIn recent times, NYSC has been in the vanguard of the nation\u2019s drive to correct the imbalance in our rural-urban development through the various community development programmes executed by corps members. These programmes have revolutionized our communities in the areas of education, environment, healthcare delivery, agriculture, communication, infrastructure, technology, economic empowerment, poverty eradication, social services and above all national consciousness and socio-cultural regeneration.\n\nBy carrying out this selfless and patriotic exercise, the Corps members have underscored the commitment of the scheme to a clean and sustainable ecosystem that supports the life of all living in it, man, plants and of course animals.\n\nKeeping our environment clean is the duty of every citizen, from personal hygiene to our surroundings, let cultivate the culture of cleanliness. Remember the popular adage that says \u201ccleanliness is next to godliness\u201d.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving Corps member with The Nigerian Observer, Benin City.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 2021/22 EPL season kicked off at the Brentford Community Stadium between the newbies and one of the league\u2019s oldest statesmen. It was the Bees who took the lead through Sergi Canos in the 22nd minute. It was a sweet strike from the edge of the Arsenal box after Calum Chambers failed to properly get rid of the ball.\n\nThe second exposed a familiar Arsenal failing. A long throw into the box was not well defended and with two Brentford players itching to knock it in, it fell to Christian Noergaard to score Brentford\u2019s second goal.\n\nAll 11 men who started for Brentford were experiencing the EPL for the first time as starters while Arsenal had injury and illness to blame for naming a very young team that included Folarin Balogun- a debutant while Bukayo Saka started on the bench.\n\nThe Gunners had started the better and immediately won a corner kick from kickoff and had 60 per cent of ball possession in the first 10 minutes. But it was the Bees who could have taken the early lead when a knockdown from Ivan Toney fell to Bryan Mbeumo, whose right-footed shot went out via Bernd Leno\u2019s left post.\n\nNigerian midfielder Frank Onyeka got his first taste of British football and acquitted himself very well, showing good tactical awareness to cover space and he still had time to try and get into the Arsenal box. He lasted 80 minutes before he left the pitch to enthusiastic applause.\n\nArsenal caved in at the first moment Brentford put in some consistent pressure and while the Gunners were good in the third quarter, they did not defend their half very well. A clearance, not well dealt with by Chambers, was headed back to Canos, who squared Chambers and beat Leno at his near post.\n\nThe stats do not make good reading for Arsenal when they go behind, especially from last season where in 14 matches that they conceded the first goal, they fell to 10 defeats. On Friday, they could not respond though not for want of trying, especially from Emile Smith-Rowe, who for the first 10 minutes of the second half led the Arsenal revival.\n\nArsenal have thus started the new season poorly after they ended last season in a dismal eighth position despite five consecutive wins to end the season. For a few hours, Brentford are top of the EPL with three points and a clean sheet.\n\nAt the end of 90 minutes, Brentford manager Thomas Frank was conducting the crowd to \u2018we are top of the league\u2019.The Bees show their sting very early \u2013 all opponents beware because Brentford are buzzing for the oncoming challenge.",

Our ability to farm, attend school and carry out our legitimate businesses is being denied by these terrorist activities.\n\n\u201cOur experience indicates a weakness in the level of engagement and sincerity of public officials in dealing with these issues; the role of corruption and the failure of our security system to use information or Intel in responding on time and adequately to various early warning signals.\n\n\u201cWe have also observed with certainty that some public figures, while embarrassed by the security and humanitarian situation, prefer to white-wash or deny the extent and impact of the crisis rather than act decisively in addressing the relevant issues.\n\n\u201cAs stakeholders in the Nigerian society and leaders of the over 400 indigenous communities of Central and Northern Nigeria, we are key stakeholders in the Nigerian Project and must play our part in addressing these national issues.\n\n\u201cThe CONAECDA conference had decided to immediately commence a project to secure, reconstruct and protects such communities.

This was key to addressing challenges associated with productivity and corruption.\n\nYemi-Esan also presented a report on the implementation status of the Federal Civil Service Strategy Plan 2017-2021.\n\nShe identified staff welfare, particularly remuneration and housing, as areas that require better focus and urgent intervention by the Federal Government.\n\nThe head of service appealed for improved support, particularly in funding the implementation of successive strategy and implementation plans to overhaul the service for better productivity.\n\nYemi-Esan said the current reform in the Federal Civil Service had enabled government to save huge sums through the verification of personnel payroll and digitization of some operations, among others.\n\nShe said that her office would continue to lead the reform process as the 2021-2025 plan went forward to the Federal Executive Council for approval.\n\nThe meeting featured comments and observations on the proposed plan tabled on behalf of the Steering Committee, chaired by the Head of Service.",

          "text": "Brentford celebrated their return to the top tier after a 74-year absence with a memorable, magnificent victory over woeful Arsenal as they opened their Premier League campaign in style.\n\nThomas Frank\u2019s side were vibrant, skilful and energetic on a night of high emotion at the Brentford Community Stadium, making the perfect start to the season, but inflicting serious pain on the Gunners in a sobering 90 minutes for the visitors.\n\nBrentford took to life in the big time with ease and fully deserved the lead given to them after 22 minutes when Sergi Canos drove low past keeper Bernd Leno at the near post, although Arsenal complained bitterly that the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\n\nOnly Emile Smith Rowe truly rose above the mediocrity for Arsenal, forcing a save out of Brentford keeper David Raya \u2013 who also brilliantly denied Nicolas Pepe late on \u2013 before the home fans exploded in noise and elation when they scored a second with 17 minutes left.\n\nArsenal, without strike pair Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang through illness, paid the price for a hopeless attempt to defend substitute Mads Sorensen\u2019s routine long throw. New \u00a350m defender Ben White was particularly culpable as Christian Norgaard arrived to head home.\n\nBrentford\u2019s supporters, understandably, celebrated wildly at the final whistle, but this was a result and performance that instantly turns the spotlight on Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as he desperately needs an improvement on last season.\n\nBrentford could not have made a better start to life in the Premier League, showing the pedigree that has made them such an entertaining side on their journey to this stage.\n\nOn a thunderous night at the Brentford Community Stadium, the arena was alive with noise and excitement well before kick-off \u2013 and what happened when the action started only raised those levels.\n\nTough days will inevitably lie ahead for the top-flight newcomers, but this was a night when the Bees showed what they were all about under charismatic manager Frank.\n\nOnce they realised Arsenal had little offer after the early exchanges, Brentford took charge and Bryan Mbeumo had already struck the post before Canos opened the scoring.\n\nThey grew in confidence, winning the physical challenges, attacking swiftly and, on the rare occasions he was called upon, keeper Raya looked a class act.\n\nFrank and his players rightly savoured the moment at the final whistle \u2013 in front of supporters who did themselves huge credit with the standing ovation given to Arsenal substitute Bukayo Saka, who was racially abused after missing a penalty in England\u2019s Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.\n\nThis was quite simply how Brentford would have scripted it. No-one can begrudge them their victory \u2013 and the manner in which they revelled in it.",

          "text": "\u2026Dialogue only solution \u2013 Blueprint publisher\n\nPresident of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Malam Mukhtar Zubairu Sirajo, has said all the socio-cultural groups \u201cbelieve in the existence of Nigeria as one indivisible entity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe hot air that the leaders of these groups blow when they speak are products of anger and frustration at what ought to be that is not in place.\u201d\n\nSirajo stated this Friday when he paid a courtesy call on the chairman/ publisher of Blueprint Newspapers, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi (FNIPR), at the paper\u2019s corporate headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe socio-cultural groups, we know the role they play in terms of generating and sustaining narratives. No matter the agenda behind the narratives you cannot ignore them.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have had sit-downs with Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Middle Belt Forum, PANDEFF, Afenifere, Northern Elders Forum, and we are meeting with Ohaneze Ndigbo sometime next week in Enugu.\n\n\u201cThe important and encouraging thing we have come out with in our engagements with these organisations is that in spite of what we read and what we see in the media it is their abiding faith in the country; despite the hot air that they blow when they are talking.\n\n\u201cSo, our conclusion is that that hot air is a product of anger and frustration at what ought to be that is not in place. Of all people, Pa Adebanjo was telling us last week that nobody has more faith in Nigeria than him, which was quite at variance with the picture we have of him.\n\nSirajo, who lamented the lack of trust among the various ethnic and religious groups in Nigeria, attributed the same to lack of communication.\n\nHe, however, said the situation was redeemable through communication.\n\n\u201cThe NIPR feels that the situation is not irredeemable. We can get the communication component correct; we would have laid the foundation for the return of sanity to the country. We must come together and discuss issues in a sincere and mature manner. There is no problem that communication cannot solve. Virtually all problems arise from either breakdown or lack of communication.\u201d\n\nHe added it was against that backdrop that the NIPR was convening a citizens\u2019 summit with the theme, National Integration, Peace and Security: A pan Nigerian Coalition, which aims at bringing Nigerians from different backgrounds.\n\nSpeaking further, he solicited the partnership of Blueprint Newspapers in making the summit a success.\n\nSpeaking, the publisher thanked NIPR for intervening in the situation in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to thank you for this intervention you are doing to make sure that we have security in Nigeria. Every war, everything that ever happened in the world, good or bad, ends up in dialogue. Whether you like it or not you can fight all the fights, the only way to settle it is that you have to come to the table.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some will die, others will get maimed, and property will be lost. We don\u2019t want that to continue to happen. But I think this a very good intervention by the Institute to ensure that people begin to communicate, because it is only through communication that conflicts can be resolved.\u201d\n\nHe pledged the commitment of Blueprint towards the success of the national dialogue.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for a reform of the Nigerian civil service by doing \u201csomething bold and big that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a mass housing policy for all civil servants fits into this \u201cbold and big\u201d agenda, a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Laolu Akande on Friday said.\n\nProf Osinbajo reportedly made the comment on Thursday at the Presidential Villa when he received a brief on the Federal Civil Service Strategy & Implementation Plan 2021-2025, presented by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan.\n\nThe meeting is a Presidential Level Briefing of the reform process of the Federal Civil Service which has been on since 2017.\n\nThe reform is being led by Steering and Implementation Committees with membership drawn from the public and private sectors with the engagement of development partners.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting was attended by the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami; Ministers of Labour & Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed; Ministers of State, Budget & National Planning, Prince Clem Agba; and Works and Housing, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Dr. Adeyemi Dipeolu, some of Nigeria\u2019s development partners including officials of the World Bank and the President of the Africa Initiative for Governance, Mr Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, (a private sector representative and member of Steering Committee) were also present.\n\nSpeaking after listening to Dr Yemi-Esan\u2019s presentation and subsequent contributions by ministers and other participants at the meeting, the Vice President noted that \u201cit is evident that perhaps, for the first time in a long time, some very serious attention is being paid to all of the various issues in our civil service.\u201d\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, \u201cI think that we should really do something that is bold, big and that will really make the difference in order to address some of the issues especially that of accommodation for civil servants.\n\n\u201cWe can do much more with mass housing. We have a target now of 300,000 houses under our ESP social housing scheme. CBN has allocated N200 billion, but we have seen that we can provide mass housing, and we can make civil servants beneficiaries of the scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the housing scheme is very modest, it is the sort of thing that we can at least do, to begin to take into account, the fact that everybody who worked for the civil service deserves to live in their own home. There must be a strategy for giving everybody a place to live in,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nMaking the point about access to affordable homes being one of the easiest ways to get people out of poverty, Prof Osinbajo said \u201cit is a vital part of what we are trying to do\u201d, noting that \u201cwe must address it. A civil servant ought to be able to own a home, and justify to his family the reason why he went for the job\u201d.\n\nRelating his experience while serving as Attorney General in Lagos State, Prof. Osinbajo said that like what was done with the reform of the Lagos State Judiciary, fixing the welfare of federal civil servants would be key to addressing challenges associated with productivity and corruption.\n\nThe Head of the Civil Service of the Federation also presented a report on the implementation status of the Federal Civil Service Strategy Plan 2017-2021.\n\nEarlier in her presentation, Dr Yemi-Esan identified staff welfare particularly, remuneration and housing as areas that require better focus and urgent intervention by the Federal Government.\n\nShe appealed for improved support, particularly in funding the implementation of successive strategy and implementation plans to overhaul the service for better productivity.\n\nThe Head of the Civil Service of the Federation said the current reform in the Federal Civil Service has enabled government to save huge sums through the verification of personnel payroll and digitization of some operations, among others.\n\nThe Head of Service would continue to lead the reform process as the 2021-2025 plan goes forward to the Federal Executive Council for approval.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting featured comments and observations on the proposed plan tabled on behalf of the Steering Committee chaired by the Head of Service.",

          "text": "The Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) are considering whether to embark on industrial action, ahead of a planned meeting on Sunday.\n\nPresident of the association, Professor Ken Ozoilo, disclosed this to Channels Television on Friday in Abuja during an exclusive interview.\n\nThis comes as Nigerians struggle for medical treatment across government facilities amid the ongoing nationwide strike by members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD).\n\nThe senior medical practitioners had issued a 21-day ultimatum to the Federal Government, which is set to expire on August 16.\n\n\u201cMDCAN issued an ultimatum to (the) government \u2013 a 21-day ultimatum that is going to expire on Monday,\u201d Ozoilo told Channels Television. \u201cThis ultimatum is to give leeway for \u2026 a resolution of the issues at hand.\n\n\u201cOf course, if this is achieved, there will be no reason to proceed on strike. Our requests were very specific and I will say that what we have achieved thus far \u2026 were far from resolution at this point in time.\u201d\n\nThe association is protesting a circular from the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) directing the removal of its members from the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS), among other demands.\n\nAccording to the MDCAN president, the government has failed to meet the demands made by the medical association.\n\nHe stated that the leadership of the union has had several communications with the government on the matter and other issues, but there has been no solution in sight.\n\n\u2018Take A Decision\u2019\n\nProfessor Ozoilo insisted that the government has yet to address the concerns that led to the ultimatum issued by the medical professionals, saying that their next move would be revealed after the meeting.\n\n\u201cOf course, you know that the primary among our demands is the withdrawal of the letter written by the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) that directed universities that were remunerating their clinical lecturers on CONMESS to desist from that practice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the immediate cause and other issues have been there. The National Executive Council of our association is going to meet on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have an emergency NEC meeting where we will x-ray the progress that\u2019s so far made and take a decision.\u201d\n\nNARD strike\n\nThe industrial action by the resident doctors, which has run into a second week, has crippled activities and left patients stranded in many government-owned hospitals in the country.\n\nMembers of the association had gone on strike in protest against the irregularities in the payment of salaries to house officers, among other issues.\n\nThey also accused the government of failing to fulfill its promise to members of the association who died of COVID-19 in the line of duty.\n\nThe strike began a week after President Muhammadu Buhari left Nigeria for the United Kingdom where he participated in the Global Education Summit on Financing Global Partnership for Education (GPE) 2021-2025.\n\nAfter the summit, he stayed back in London for an earlier scheduled medical check-up before returning to the country on Friday.",

          "text": "The Taliban seized more major cities on Friday as they raced towards full control of Afghanistan and inched closer to Kabul, with the United States and Britain deploying thousands of troops to evacuate their citizens from the capital.\n\nThe evacuation orders came as the Taliban took control of Kandahar \u2014 their spiritual heartland and the nation\u2019s second-biggest city \u2014 leaving only Kabul and small pockets of holdouts in government hands.\n\nThe scale and speed of the onslaught has shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country after toppling the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks nearly 20 years ago.\n\nSecurity forces have capitulated on fronts, with individual soldiers, units and even whole divisions surrendering \u2014 handing the insurgents even more vehicles and military hardware to fuel their lightning advance.\n\nPul-e-Alam, capital of Loghar province, was the latest city to fall Friday, putting the Taliban just 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Kabul.\n\nKhairddin Logari, a resident of the capital, summed up the confusion.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going on,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe Taliban offensive was launched in early May after US President Joe Biden ordered the start of a final withdrawal due to be complete by the end of the month, leaving the battlefield to the insurgents.\n\nBritish Defence Minister Ben Wallace said Friday the hasty pullout had been \u201ca mistake\u201d.\n\n\u2018Completely conquered\u2019\n\nEarlier Friday, officials and residents in Kandahar told AFP that government forces had withdrawn en masse to a military facility outside the southern city.\n\n\u201cKandahar is completely conquered. The Mujahideen reached Martyrs\u2019 Square,\u201d a Taliban spokesman tweeted, referring to a city landmark.\n\nHours later, the Taliban said they had also taken control of Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand province.\n\nA security source confirmed the fall of the city, telling AFP that the Afghan military and government officials had evacuated Lashkar Gah after striking a local ceasefire deal with the militants.\n\nWhile there have been widespread reports of atrocities by the Taliban, fears that they would exact a punishing revenge on their opponents are so far unfounded.\n\nIn Herat on Friday, the Taliban captured the city\u2019s long-time strongman Ismail Khan, who helped lead the defence of the provincial capital along with his militia fighters.\n\nThe warlord\u2019s spokesman later confirmed Khan had been allowed to return to his residence following negotiations with the insurgents.\n\nWashington and London announced plans late Thursday to pull out their embassy staff and citizens from the capital.\n\n\u201cThis is not abandonment,\u201d US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, while noting the embassy would remain open.\n\n\u201cThis is not an evacuation. This is not the wholesale withdrawal.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon said 3,000 US troops would be deployed to Kabul within the next 24 to 48 hours, underscoring they would not be used to launch attacks against the Taliban.\n\nBritain was deploying around 600 troops to help evacuate its roughly 3,000 nationals from the country, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying the \u201cvast bulk\u201d of remaining embassy staff in Kabul would return to the UK.\n\nOther nations, including Denmark, Norway, and Germany, announced their Kabul embassies would be temporarily shuttered or operations reduced due to security concerns.\n\nHelicopters flitted back and forth between the airport and the sprawling US diplomatic compound in Kabul\u2019s heavily fortified green zone \u2014 46 years after choppers evacuated Americans from Saigon, signaling the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nKandahar calm\n\nThe insurgents have taken over more than half the nation\u2019s provincial capitals in the past week and encircled the biggest city in the north, the traditional anti-Taliban bastion of Mazar-i-Sharif, which is now one of the few holdouts remaining.\n\nIn Kandahar, resident Abdul Nafi told AFP the city was calm after the government forces pulled out early Friday.\n\n\u201cI came out this morning, I saw Taliban white flags in most squares of the city\u2026 I thought it might be the first day of Eid.\u201d\n\nPro-Taliban social media accounts have boasted of the vast spoils of war captured by the insurgents, posting photos of armoured vehicles, heavy weapons, and even a drone seized by their fighters at abandoned military bases.\n\nAs the rout unspooled, three days of meetings between key international players on Afghanistan ended in Qatar without significant progress.\n\nIn a joint statement, the international community, including the United States, Pakistan, the European Union, and China, said they would not recognise any government in Afghanistan \u201cimposed through the use of military force.\u201d\n\nAFP",

There was also a partial internet restriction.\n\nLungu said election-day violence had killed two people \u2014 including the chairman of his party in North-Western province.\n\nIn a statement, he said he had directed the army commander \u201cto quickly re-enforce security in North-Western, some parts of Western, and Southern provinces where this unprecedented violence is taking place\u201d.\n\n\u201cI will not take kindly to these evil schemes,\u201d he vowed. \u201cHow can you talk about free and fair elections when our opponents have taken this election as war?\u201d he said.\n\nThe troop deployment was just a \u201cdistraction\u201d, opposition United Party for National Development spokesman Anthony Bwalya told AFP.\n\nSixteen candidates were vying for the top job, but the frontrunners are Lungu, 64, and business tycoon Hichilema, who are facing off at the polls for the third time and who between the two of them garnered almost 98 per cent of the votes in the 2016 election.\n\nIt is Hichilema\u2019s sixth attempt at the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that we will carry the day,\u201d he said after voting at a secondary school in a leafy suburb of Lusaka. \u201cPeople want change \u2014 you can see it in their faces,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAddressing opposition fears of fraud, Hichilema said Zambia\u2019s next leader \u201cmust be determined by the\u2026 voters, not the people who count the votes\u201d.\n\nA flagging economy and rising living costs have eroded Lungu\u2019s support base in recent years, surveys suggest.\n\nLungu is accused of borrowing unsustainably, particularly from Chinese creditors, to finance a spree of infrastructure projects.\n\nUnder his administration, Zambia became the first African country to default on its sovereign debt since the coronavirus pandemic began, while inflation soared to more than 20 per cent.\n\nLungu\u2019s critics point to poverty and joblessness in the midst of glittering infrastructure.\n\nAround seven million citizens were eligible to vote for a president, legislators and local government representatives.\n\nThe winning candidate must acquire more than 50 per cent of votes to avoid a second-round runoff.
