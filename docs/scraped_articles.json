          "title": "Why we have strict travel protocols in Nigeria -FG",
          "text": "The Federal Government says its strict travel protocols are put in place to protect its citizens from being infected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made this known while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nMohammed said Nigeria had been tagged as a very strict country in terms of travel protocols, explaining that the stand of the government was to protect its people against the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cWe have been accused that our rules are being stringent. We say no. We are not being tough for toughness sake. We are being tough because that is what science demands. We are tough because we want to protect our people.\n\n\u201cThis is why you will see that the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has designated and ranked different parts of the globe where the Delta variant is prevalent or the very high risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe have labelled them restricted countries. As of today, we have only four of such; South Africa, India, Brazil and Turkey. And there are strict travel protocols around these countries because we want to prevent and protect our people.\n\n\u201cThe first instance, nationals of these countries are not allowed into Nigeria. If you are a Brazilian and you are coming from Brazil and Indian coming from India, a South African coming from South Africa or Turkish coming from Turkey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean a Brazilian living in London cannot come, you can come if you are coming from London. And also, not everybody coming from these countries are banned, we make exemptions; diplomats are exempted, high-level government officials, those coming to fix our infrastructure and economy are exempted by PSC.\n\n\u201cBut no matter what category, whether a Nigerian coming from Turkey or you are exempted for whatever you are coming to do in Nigeria, you must observe the travel protocols which means you check in straight into a quarantined facility approved by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAnd when you are there, your health is monitored constantly. On day two of your arrival, you will do a COVID-19 test, do another one day seven; it is only after you are tested negative at day seven that you are allowed to go home and meet your relations.\n\n\u201cHowever those who are coming from non-restricted countries, also have their own protocols to observe. Day one, they must self-isolate in their respective homes and two. Day seven, they must come out and do a test before they are being discharged,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe minister said regrettably, many people who came in from non-restricted countries did not observe self-isolation and even when they did they thought it was an occasion to invite friends and relations.\n\n\u201cIt is a dangerous practice. Those doing that are endangering their lives, the lives of their friends and relations.\n\n\u201cIf you have taken the two doses of your AstraZeneca or new Moderna, they will not prevent you from catching COVID-19 again, the only advantage you have, if you catch it after you took the vaccine, you won\u2019t be terribly sick, you may not even notice it, you won\u2019t be hospitalised and you will not die of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIf someone comes in from a country like India for instance, even if he is vaccinated and he meets a Nigerian who has been vaccinated, that Nigerian can still catch it because you need to have vaccinated at least 70 per cent of your population.\n\n\u201cIt is when you have vaccinated 70 per cent of your population before you can achieve what they call herd immunity. Here we are still struggling with two per cent vaccination.\n\n\u201cSo that is why we put what looks like tough travel protocols around most restricted and non-restricted countries.\u201d\n\nMohammed, however, noted that this list was not final and any country Nigeria noticed that COVID-19 or delta variant was becoming endemic, such a country would be added to the list because it was all about the safety of the lives of the citizens.

          "text": "Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye housemate, Whitemoney, has revealed his reason for not having a university degree.\n\nIn a conversation, monitored by our correspondent on Wednesday, day 18 of the show, Whitemoney told JMK that he doesn\u2019t have a degree because he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to the university.\n\nThe discussion ensued as the duo got to know more about themselves. Along the line, the issue of marriage surfaced and Whitemoney said that when it comes to marriage, he doesn\u2019t care about the tribe but he wants a smart and educated woman.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want a smart woman because I didn\u2019t go to school. I am smart but I didn\u2019t go to school. I don\u2019t want a situation whereby my children will ask me about their assignments and I\u2019ll be lost.\n\n\u201cWhen they come, I\u2019ll tell them \u2018go and meet your mother\u2019. My own is to make money. I don\u2019t know how to solve maths.\u201d\n\nWhen JMK asked him about his family, he revealed that he has two brothers and no sister, adding that his siblings are \u2018big men\u2019 who have so many certifications.\n\n\u201cAny degree you want to talk about, they have them. As for me, as I managed to finish my NECO, I said, \u2018To God be the glory\u2019, Whitemoney said.\n\nJMK then asked how he was able to escape going to school like his brothers.\n\nWhitemoney answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t escape it, I just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to go. That\u2019s just it. But it didn\u2019t stop my limit. It didn\u2019t stop me from achieving things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well outspoken if I want to speak. I speak it without any \u2018comma\u2019. I write too. That\u2019s the basic thing. Every other thing is extra. I pay you to do it.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Vincent Kalu\n\nEmbattled National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, got a respite, yesterday, as stakeholders okayed his stay in office pending the conduct of a national convention.\n\nHowever, the party national convention, where new party officials will be elected will now hold by the end of October, 2021 instead of December, when the tenure of incumbent National Working Committee (NWC) is supposed to elapse.\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, briefed journalists, in Abuja, on the outcome of the meeting between the governors, the Board of Trustees (BoT), and other critical stakeholders in the opposition party.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the 13 PDP governors, BoT members, National Assembly members amongst others\n\nTambuwal added that the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) will meet next week to constitute the convention planing committee as well as the committee on zoning.\n\nAt the, National Zoning Committee, which will allocate elective offices in 2023, including the national chairmanship positions, the president and vice president would also be constituted.\n\nHe explained that Secondus, as chairman of the PDP would convene the NEC meeting in line with the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe decision to hold the national convention in October is a middle course approach in the resolution of the PDP crisis.\n\nDaily Sun reliably gathered that the pendulum swung in favour of the national chairman after he addressed the governors on Monday. Secondus told the governors he had done nothing wrong to get the kind of treatment he was getting, noting that his transducers are the same people he supported to win election with material and financial resources.\n\nA highly placed source told Daily Sun that at the governors meeting on Monday, after the Forum resolved that the convention should be held in October, the anti-Secondus governors started pushing that members of the NWC should be barred from re-contesting at the convention.\n\nThe source said immediately the NWC members got wind of the proposal to bar them from re-contesting at the national convention, they moved round party leaders to solicit their support against the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe governors proposal was that the national convention should be held in October and that the members of the NWC should serve out their tenure. But some of the governors insisted that the NWC should not re-contest at the convention.\u201d\n\nHe said when the proposal for any early convention was tabled at the stakeholders meeting, Secondus told them that October was not feasible.\n\n\u201cBut Secondus told them October was not feasible, as the NWC has slated state congress in nine states for October 16. However, the chairman agreed that the convention can hold in November,\u201d the source stated.\n\nRegardless of the position of the governors and other stakeholders, lawmaker representing Khana/Gokana Federal Constituency, Dumnamene Dekor, has urged Secondus, to resign honourably.\n\nDekor, chairman, House Committee on Host Communities, said there could not be a better time for the Secondus-led PDP to quit than now for a more focused leadership to be put in place.\n\nThe federal lawmaker, who was also a one-time deputy speaker of Rivers State House of Assembly, and Commissioner of Works, hinged his call on what he described as heading a \u201cvisionless leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Ogoni-born politician noted with dismay the ceaseless conflicts, bickering and defections that characterized the Secondus\u2019 administration, positing that the earlier his party leadership is replaced, the better for the PDP.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the PDP is the only hope Nigerians have for survival in view of the economic quagmire the All Progressives Congress (APC) has plunged the country into.\n\nHe stressed that PDP could not afford to go in for the 2023 general elections under a leadership that cannot deliver.\n\nDekor noted that the national PDP leadership as presently constituted, lacks all it takes to reclaim the party\u2019s mandate under the prevailing political realities in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, former deputy national chairman of PDP, Chief Bode George, has come hard on the NWC of the party, describing it as a shameful symbol of avarice and greed.\n\nAccording to him, the critical organ of the opposition party has sold out to former governor of Lagos State, and the National leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn a statement entitled, \u201cSpecial Meeting of PDP Elders \u2013 My Position\u201d the former Ondo military governor, noted that the party was at critical crossroads between survival or extinction, emphasising that, \u201cthe outcome of this meeting will decide where our future lies, adding that, \u201cwe must speak the truth to power without mincing words, as the current National Working Committee is a shameful symbol of avarice and greed.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the NWC is rudderless, visionless, stripped of any moral anchor, and has abused and trampled recklessly upon the sacred grund norm, of the party constitution.\n\nChief George, therefore, called for an immediate setting up of a National Convention Committee, which should be saddled with the burden of organising congresses from the ward level to the national level.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to get it right lest we lose it all; the nation is waiting for us to rescue our people from the ruling party\u2019s divisive and destructive politics. Let it be very clear to all and sundry that the present leadership of the NWC has compromised in totality.\n\n\u201cIt has sold us out totally to Bola Tinubu. I am absolutely certain of this. Let us take our party back from these fifth columnists who have sowed confusion in our midst from Maiduguri to Calabar, from Sokoto to Delta, from Abuja to Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe must be honest and bold enough to set up the National Convention Committee that will handle all the congresses from the ward level to the National Convention. Anything short of this will send our party to the precipice of apocalypse, the Atona O\u2019odua of Yorubaland warned.\n\nThe crisis in the PDP came to the fore last Tuesday after seven deputy national officers served the NWC a 30-day resignation notice.\n\nSame day, the National Youth Leader, Sunday Udeh-Okoye, who confirmed a crack in the NWC, openly called for Secondus\u2019 resignation over alleged poor leadership of the party.\n\nIn the aftermath of the notice of resignation and split in the NWC, the BoT set up a committee to resolve the crisis.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Ruling party\u2019s govs back Buni, as Secondus survives in no victor, no vanquished decision\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Treasure Chinelobi in Abuja\n\nConscious of the implications of the current state of their parties to surviving the next general election, the leaderships of both the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have finally got a hold of their respective challenges, setting the parties on new opportunities.\n\nIn the APC, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of party, has reaffirmed its support for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee of the party led by the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni and asked it to proceed with the conduct of the local government and state congresses, as well as the national convention of the party, in line with the mandate of the National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nHowever, in the PDP, after two major meetings of the party\u2019s stakeholders and Board of Trustees (BoT) members, its leadership agreed to allow the Uche Secondus National Working Committee (NWC) to continue in office till the next national convention, which has been brought forward from December to October, but with an understanding that the current NWC members would not seek re-election.\n\nThe APC governors, in a communique issued yesterday and signed by its chairman and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, following a meeting on Sunday, in Abuja, said after further reviewing the situation, they were convinced that their decision was well informed.\n\nBut a group of party members under the banner of Concerned APC Stakeholders, hasalleged that the caretaker committee of the party and some second term governors were bent on making sure the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regained power in 2023.\n\nThe Forum said it further reviewed progress being made by the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee in its effort to rebuild structures of the party at all levels and commended members of the committee led by Buni for the successful conduct of the ward congresses across the country.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Forum reaffirmed its support for the Caretaker Committee to proceed to conduct local government, state congresses and national convention, in line with the mandate of the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cForum was further briefed on the July 28, 2021, judgement of the Supreme Court on Ondo State 2020 Governorship election and recognised that the legal status of both the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee as well as its composition has been legally settled.\u201d\n\nHaving reviewed progress in the party, the Forum commended all party members for theircommitment towards rebuilding the party, adding that, it noted with satisfaction reports from various states of commendable mobilisation and participation in the July 31st, 2021 ward congresses, which was successful.\n\nOn the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), the Forum stressed that grievances of the Resident Doctors were with state governments, and therefore appealed to them to negotiate with individual state governments and issues affecting them.\n\nThe Forum endorsed the initiative of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and supported the call by the federal government through the Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige for the immediate suspension of the strike to allow negotiations to continue.\n\n\u201cNoting that most of the grievances of the Resident Doctors are with State governments, Forum appealed to the Resident Doctors to negotiate with individual state governments and issues affecting Resident Doctors in federal establishments should be negotiated with the relevant structures of the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Concerned APC Stakeholders, have insisted that the recent Supreme Court pronouncement on the Ondo governorship election, which suggested that the Buni-led committee was not constitutional and as such could not organise valid congresses, signalled judicial problems that could cost the APC in future elections.\n\nThe group, in a statement issued Tuesday by its spokesperson, Mr. Abdulahi Dauda, insisted that the caretaker committee remained illegal going by the apex court pronouncement.\n\nIn the group\u2019s statement signed by its spokesperson, Abdulahi Dauda, the group insisted that only a duly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) could validly hold congresses or nominate candidates and not the Buni-led Caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cBuni is the governor of Yobe State but doubles as APC caretaker chairman, a development,which is at the heart of the current crisis in the party,\u201d said the group, which noted that the caretaker committee was unknown to the party\u2019s constitution and that it was operating without reference to the party\u2019s constitution\n\nIt added: \u201cFor the love of our great party, we asked that the leaders of our party and those,who genuinely love our party to rise up now and stop Buni and his second term governors that have spent 8yrs and have nothing to lose if the courts hand victory to PDP in 2023 through court pronouncement.\u201d\n\nThe group was of the view that there was need for the caretaker committee to stop running the affairs of the party, as all their activities were not recognised in the APC constitution and therefore, illegal.\n\n\u201cIf not controlled or expeditiously managed, the caretaker committee may end up becoming a disgrace and will spell doom for the party. that is why we are here to raise our voices as we don\u2019t want the party we laboured for to go into extinction like it happened in Rivers, Bayelsa and Zamfara,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the PDP, sources told THISDAY that the decision by the Secondus NWC to jettison re-election at the national convention, which has just been brought forward to a new date, was a gentleman understanding out of their freewill, seeing too that they had to shift grounds in collective interest, and in a no victor, no vanquished resolution. The governors, THISDAY learnt had earlier come into the meeting with a position to exclude NWC members from the election. But this was opposed by some members who pointed out the illegality of such a move.\n\nEven the gentleman understanding by the NWC members was said not to have gone down well with some members of the party, who described the decision as illegal and unconstitutional, leaving the door open for a possible challenge at a later date.\n\nAlso, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, has dismissed any such thing, saying \u201cthe party wishes to clarify that no decision was taken to bar any member of the NWC from exercising his or her rights under the constitution of the PDP to contest in the forthcoming National Convention of the party,\u201d his position has been dismissed as a volte face by other members of the party.\n\nOlogbondiyan said the explanation had become imperative given misrepresentations of the outcome of the intervention by elders and leaders of the party on the challenges faced by the PDP, adding: \u201cWhile the PDP has put these challenges behind it, the NWC states that it will continue to adapt itself to the Constitution, traditions and practices of the party in carrying out its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nBut despite Ologbondiyan\u2019s explanation, party leadership hierarchs, members as well its supporters, breathed a sigh of relief that some form of peace has been achieved, quelling the raging inferno that had engulfed its ranks in the last few weeks.\n\nThe first meeting was learnt, comprised mainly members of the BoT, current and former governors, former ministers, former Senators and former Presiding and principal officers of the National Assembly, while the second one included the other stakeholders of the party at different levels.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the path to the success recorded at yesterday\u2019s meetings had been prepared since Monday, August 9, 2021, when during the meeting of the governors, Secondus and his estranged ally, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, believed to be responsible for his plight, were brought together to confront each other and disclose to the sitting what the exact problem was.\n\nThis is in addition to the fact that THISDAY had exclusively reported yesterday that the party was planning to bring forward its national convention as part of the new deals, preceding the search for a lasting peace, going forward.\n\nAfter both men had allegedly addressed the gathering, especially, that they also saw the need to sheathe their swords in the interest and future of the party, more so with Wike allegedly consenting to the fact that reconciliation was imperative since Secondus would eventually retire to the state, they were both asked to agree to abide by whatever would be arrived at after yesterday\u2019s meeting and they did.\n\nThus, at the joint meeting of the PDP stakeholders, yesterday, convened by the BoT, the party not only succeeded in resolving its leadership crisis, Secondus also survived the plot to remove him from office, even though he had to sacrifice the collective re-election bid (if there was any) of the NWC members.\n\nTo that extent, the governors, BoT members and other stakeholders of the party immediately approved the suggestion to bring forward the date for the party\u2019s national convention, while at the same time, proposed a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for some time next week, where other pending issues could he addressed.\n\nSecondus is expected to summon NEC for next week to allow the PDP discuss her zoning plans and set up a committee to that effect as well as constitute another committee for the convention, which has been slated tentatively to hold by the end of October.\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, while explaining why the party had to come round its internal challenge, dismissed speculations that more PDP governors might still defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying there was neither a party nor government to go to.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, after the crisis had been resolved, Tambuwal, surrounded by Wike, Secondus and other governors, said the party had no other option but to resolve the crisis because of what was ahead of it.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs party members of the BoT, members of the governor forum, members of former governors forum, former ministers, former Senators, former Presiding officer of the National Assembly and various stakeholders, we are very happy to announce that we have discussed all matters and we have resolved to continue to work as a united family.\n\n\u201cThis meeting has agreed that immediately, the NEC should be convened for the party to constitute the National Convention planning committee and the National Convention should be held latest by the end of October. Also, the zoning committee for the party should also be constituted by the same NEC immediately.\n\n\u201cSo, we thank members of the National Committee for holding up. We thank them for their prayers and support. We also thank well-meaning Nigerians, who have been waiting patiently for the resolution of these issues.\n\n\u201cThe NEC of the party shall meet most likely next week and all the issues will be addressed. And that NEC will be convened by the chairman of the party, who is constitutionally empowered to do so.\u201d Tambuwal stated.\n\nExplaining why stakeholders unanimously resolved to ensure unity in the party, the Sokoto governor said, \u201cYou can see clearly that 13 governors of our party, who are our ambassadors are in this meeting, fully committed to not only resolving the issues at hand, but also working assiduously towards delivering good governance in our respective states and moving our party forward.\n\n\u201cSpeaking on behalf of my colleagues, we have resolved; we are committed to remaining in PDP. Disregard any rumour, every rumour that any of these distinguished leaders are going anywhere. We are in PDP; we are going to remain in PDP and by the grace of God, we shall be working together to salvage Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you say you\u2019re going somewhere, where will you go? APC is no party. They do not have a ward structures as we speak. They do not have a local government structure as we speak. They do not have a state structure as we speak. They do not have national structure as we speak.\n\n\u201cAPC has never had, and is not having a Board of Trustees. So, where are you going? Are you defecting to federal government? Federal government is not there, because if it is there, asked my colleagues, who are in APC. One of them came out to say that when his students were abducted, that he saw no help.\n\n\u201cHe received no help from the federal government, and he is a governor of APC. So, what are we talking about? There is no party to defect to; there is no government to defect. We better remain together and work together, reinvent our party, and work towards the establishment of government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d, chairman, PDP governors said.\n\nIn yet another statement on how the crisis was resolved, Tambuwal said that There were extensive consultations with all major stakeholders in the party with a view to bringing all tendencies within together in view of the urgent task facing the PDP as the only viable vehicle to checkmate the abysmally poor governance of the APC-led federal government.\n\n\u201cThe meeting deliberated extensively on the issues thrown up and resolved as follows: That the Constitution, traditions and practices of the party should be strictly adhered to in finding solutions to any problems.\n\n\u201cThat all parties should sheath their sword in the greater interest of the PDP and the need to rescue Nigeria from the avoidable National malaise and drift occasioned by the APC administration.\n\n\u201cThat all processes leading to an early National Convention in October be immediately activated by relevant party organs, especially, National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cThat the party should redouble efforts to provide a credible alternative leadership for Nigeria as it still remains the only hope for the Nigerian people for good governance.\n\n\u201cThe meeting requested the NEC to immediately constitute a Zoning Committee for Party Offices and another Committee for National elective Offices.\n\nThe meeting expressed appreciation to party elders for their commitment and wisdom in handling Party affairs. We shall overcome and restore peace, security and development once again to Nigeria,\u201d, he stated.\n\nIn his opening address, Chairman, PDP\u2019s BoT, Senator Walid Jubrin said the expanded meeting of the stakeholders was called to find solutions to the problems affecting the party.\n\nNoting that it was the reason all the 13 governors and deputy governor of Zamfara State were in attendance, he however told the gathering that a former vice president of the country, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar sent his apologies.\n\nSecondus, while briefing the meeting, said the PDP, which belonged to all had reinventeditself and as such, nothing would be difficult in the current challenge to resolve.\n\nIt was gathered that Secondus allegedly told the meeting that the October date for the national convention might not be possible as the party has other activities lined up in October. Competent sources close to the Chairman, believe November would be a more realistic preposition.\n\nHe was alleged to have been overruled but that the NEC should be allowed to decide since it is the final decision-making organ on all party matters.\n\nSenate Minority Whip, Senator Philip Aduda, who represented Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe said, there would be no progress without peace, the need for a quick resolution of the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cNigerians are waiting to see how we will come out stronger. No meaningful achievements without peace,\u201d he said and commended the BoT for initiating a peaceful process.\n\nAlso, Hon. Segundo Adekoya, the House of Representatives Whip, who represented the House Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said, \u201cI have come to tell this gathering the leadership of House is behind the party. Whatever it takes at the National Assembly level, it would be done. We are solidly behind you. No more intimidation.\u201d\n\nPDP e-Registration of New Members\n\nMeanwhile, chairman of the PDP e-registration of new members and revalidation exercise, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, has said the party was targeting about 40 million new members during the exercise.\n\nHe said since the exercise started Monday, over 10000 members have already registered for the party.\n\nGovernor Obaseki explained that with the speed Nigerians were registering for the party, its victory in 2023 general election would be an accomplished mission.\n\nObaseki, who spoke at the BoT meeting of the party said, \u201cOur target is to register 40 million Nigerians as members of PDP and once we achieve that, we shall win every election landslide going forward and there will be no bases to cheat us as was done in the past\u201d.\n\nHinting on details of the e-Registration exercise, he said, \u201cI want to reiterate that the process of e-registration is local; it is meant for us leaders at the ward level and at the local government level to own our party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cEvery leader must now show us their followers by registering their followers as members of the party, PDP. Once you have registered and completed the process, your party card will be printed here at the party Secretariat and sent to the ward for distribution to members of the party,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the overall update of the exercise that started Monday, Obaseki said, \u201cAs at today, we are launching a pilot of the resignation exercise using the following state as pilot: Adamawa, Ekiti, Osun, where we almost have 250,000 new voters registered mostly by our party in the ongoing continuous voter registration exercise.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to make sure that the bulk of those new voters are members of our party and will work for our party in the upcoming election in Osun State. The other states are Taraba, Anambra, Enugu and Edo States. We will run a pilot from today till Sunday this week and from Monday next week, we shall commence a full national rollout,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022It\u2019s the only way to remove him, Dickson insists\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll not resign, says party chair\n\n\u2022Senate, House caucuses support peace moves\n\n\u2022Party commences online membership registration\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAfter meeting for over 40 minutes behind closed doors on Monday, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors and the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, appeared to have reached a new deal as part of efforts to resolve the crisis which engulfed its leadership and ensure lasting peace in the main opposition party. The deal involved consideration of an early date for the party\u2019s national convention, as against the initial date of December 9.\n\nWith the new deal, widely believed to be in the overall interest of the party, THISDAY gathered that the December convention might be brought forward to either October or November.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in an earlier statement from his media office, said he would not succumb to pressure to resign. \u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign,\u201d he was quoted as saying. He added that he remained focused in his determination to move the party forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday, supported the move by the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) to resolve the crisis in the party. Abaribe and Elumelu denied reports that PDP members in the House had passed a resolution that Secondus should resign. The clarification was in reaction to a statement by a House of Representatives member from Rivers State, Kingsley Chinda, asking the party chairman to resign.\n\nOn his part, a former governor of Bayelsa State and member of the upper chamber, Senator Seriake Dickson, faulted calls for Secondus to resign, saying only the national convention is empowered to remove him.\n\nThe PDP governors had met for over seven hours between 10am and 5pm at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge. But about 4.10pm, Secondus was invited to the meeting, which held till 4.50pm\n\nAfter meeting with the PDP governors, Secondus was seen off by the governors of Sokoto and Akwa Ibom states, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Udom Emmanuel, respectively.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign\u201d, Secondus told reporters as he made to leave the venue.\n\nAlthough a deal to bring the convention backward had been struck, it was not clear if it included the eligibility of Secondus to contest. But the details of the deal\u2019s implementation would depend on the governors\u2019 meeting today with a committee set up by the BoT to interface.\n\nTambuwal told newsmen that the governors had resolved to back the party in its march towards greater unification.\n\nTambuwal, who is Chairman, PDP Governors Forum, said, \u201cWe have resolved to work together as a forum on the side of our party and the meeting continues tomorrow.\u201d He added, \u201cVery soon, Nigerians will know that our party is united.\u201d\n\nThe Monday meeting, held at the Akwa Ibom Liaison Office in Asokoro, Abuja, was attended by all the PDP governors, with the exception of Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.\n\nBefore the forum adjourned, Secondus, who made a brief appearance, said he would not resign from his position.\n\nA short statement from his media office, signed by Ike Abonye, said nothing so far warranted his resignation from the party\u2019s highest position. It said a tiny minority calling for the national chairman\u2019s resignation should come clean and tell other members his offence and why he should resign. Secondus promised to remain focussed and committed to the ideals of the party, which he swore to protect and defend upon his election as chairman 44 months ago.\n\nElumelu, who spoke on behalf of the House caucus said, in a statement, \u201cThe attention of the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has been drawn to false and misleading publications, purporting that the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives met online and resolved that the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, should resign.\n\n\u201cThe publication is, indeed, embarrassing to PDP lawmakers in the House of Representatives, as no such meeting took place. For the avoidance of doubt, no online meeting or any meeting in any form whatsoever of PDP members in the House of Representatives was held, to discuss, let alone arrive at any decision regarding the national chairman or any issue related to the disagreements in the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur caucus in the House of Representatives is fully aligned with the intervention and decisions of the Board of Trustees (BoT), the elders and leaders of our party, in finding solutions to the leadership challenges confronting our great party and we await the outcome of their intervention.\n\n\u201cWhile we caution those behind this false and misleading publication to retrace their steps and desist from such, we also urge our party leaders, critical stakeholders, PDP members, teeming supporters, and the general public to completely disregard the said publication.\n\n\u201cWe call on all PDP members to remain calm and focused as the elders and leaders of the party will come out with solutions at this critical time.\u201d\n\nSupporting the House caucus position, their counterparts in the Senate also backed the steps taken by the BoT to resolve the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe Senate PDP Caucus, on Monday, stated that it was in full support of whatever steps being taken by the party\u2019s BoT to resolve the issues at stake.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader, who doubles as Chairman of the PDP Senate Caucus, Abaribe, told THISDAY that though the PDP senators were on annual vacation, they backed the current move by the BoT to restore peace and sanity to the opposition party.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cWe are on vacation and support the BoT effort at getting a solution.\u201d\n\nChinda and Deputy Leader, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, had made their online resolution available to journalists yesterday, after they deliberated extensively but specifically on the current charge of \u201cinept leadership\u201d against Secondus.\n\nThey noted that while PDP and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipated vigorous and well-coordinated issue-based national opposition, preparations towards a national convention as well as the 2023 general election, confusion, finger-pointing and needless noise around the party\u2019s national headquarters had complicated the noble objectives and lofty ideals of the PDP and democratic opposition politics in Nigeria.\n\nThey alleged that Secondus seemed content with occupying the office and preoccupied with holding on to his position rather than preparing for the next elections. This, they claimed, explained why Secondus inexplicably continued to miss endless opportunities that ought to have been utilised for consolidating a viable opposition, skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition, and frustrating genuine party members across states, which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\nChinda and Onyema lamented that there was no clear roadmap, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the chairman, thus, the party was allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\nThey expressed concern that a further three months under the leadership of Secondus could do grave harm to the party and put its members in a precarious situation.\n\nThey, therefore, urged Secondus \u201cto consider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\nYesterday also, an unsigned statement by some PDP National Working Committee (NWC) members said, \u201cSequel to the meeting held on the 3rd of August 2021, at Legacy House, where members of the National Working Committee (NWC) sat and decided that a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) should be held on the 8th of August 2021 at Hilton to further deliberate on the matter bedevilling the party, the meeting held and extensively deliberated, nine members of the National Working Committee (NWC) agreed that the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\n\n\u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, six members voted that he should resign and three members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors forum, the BoT, the National Assembly caucus of both House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe call on all members of the party to remain calm as the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif; National Secretary, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha; National Financial Secretary, Abdulahi Maibasira; National Youth Leader, Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye; National Vice Chairman (SW), Taofiq Arapaja; National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa; National Vice Chairman (SS), Chief Dan Osi Orbih and National vice chairman (NC), Chief Theophilus Dakas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said those who voted for the resignation of Secondus were Nazif, Adamu Udeh-Okoye, Arapaja, Orbih and Odefa.\n\nBut National Legal Adviser of PDP, Emmanuel Enoidem, disclaimed the meeting of the said members of the NWC, describing it as illegal.\n\nIn a statement, Enoidem said, \u201cI just saw the above somewhere and as a committed member of this party and by the special grace of God, a member of NWC, I have the following points to make.\n\n\u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.Subsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of the NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\u201d\n\nEnoidem maintained that the power to remove any member of the NWC and, indeed, any national officer was reserved for the national convention, which was earlier slated for December 2021.\n\nSpeaking, too, Dickson, in a release issued on Monday, flayed the purported meeting by some members of the party\u2019s NWC, whom he said went outside the constitution of the party to convene a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the national chairman. He drew the attention of PDP leaders, members as well as Nigerians to the fact that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and did not represent a valid resolution or decision of the NWC known to the PDP constitution.\n\nDickson stated, \u201cThe purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP. It is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: three members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement, leaving out the majority of 13, who were not at the meeting and the chairman, who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore, it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crisis in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nWhile puncturing a purported statement by the PDP caucus in the House, which asked Secondus to resign, Dickson said, \u201cAll this is to create a media frenzy backed up with the sponsored demonstrations at the party secretariat on Monday, which are designed to force the chairman to resign in order to set up a caretaker committee, which is illegal.\n\n\u201cHappily, the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has issued a statement a short while ago that he will not resign. I support this decision fully as it is backed by the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, a vote of no confidence even by a duly constituted NWC or other organs of the party does not remove a Chairman. The chairman is voted for and can only be removed by the National Convention unless on his own volition, he chooses to resign.\u201d\n\nParty Commences Membership Registration\n\nMeanwhile, PDP has commenced online membership registration and revalidation in soe states. The states piloting the initiative in the first phase of the programme are Anambra, Osun, Ekiti, Edo, Adamawa, and Sokoto.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abuja while launching the project, Secondus stated that the \u201ccountry must at this point in time migrate from analogue to digital.\n\n\u201cData is the key to development; data is the key to proper planning and data is the way a country would be able to attract development from the global community. We as a party cannot do otherwise. We are operating in social media space, so, PDP cannot do without data.\u201d\n\nSecondus explained that by offering online registration, the party was providing Nigerians with a transparent platform to harness their democratic potential.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe project will deepen the process of membership registration and also deepen the process of democracy in attracting development. Usually, in the analogue time, they have to bring the register and if they don\u2019t like your face, you will not be a member. Some people will take the register away. All that has been eliminated.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the e-registration was a demonstration of PDP\u2019s readiness for the 2023 general election. Jibrin assured members that the crisis rocking the party would soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe have spent so many sleepless nights in ensuring that we resolved the crisis within our party in order to make PDP great again and also take advantage of the failures of the APC,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, revealed that when the logo of the party was put online during the test-running period, in less than 24 hours, over one million Nigerians indicated interest to join the party.\n\nNational Organising Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu (rtd), also said intensified sensitisation had commenced in order to create awareness on the e-registration programme down to the ward level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A woman, Tina Bright nee Everest, accused of leaving her husband, Bright Ben, to marry her pastor, the General Overseer of World Bank Assembly, Pastor Moses Adeeyo, has explained the reasons behind her actions.\n\nTina, in a video shared online, said she left her husband of 11 years after the horrendous torture and inhumane treatment she was subjected to, stating that she had the right to remarry.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have the right to marry whoever I want to, if I have found love with anybody, it is my life, not any other person's life. Leave Pastor Moses Adeeyo out of this. He is innocent; tell Bright to come and face me. I have records of his threats, I didn't want to talk but he has pushed me to the wall. He is trying to make me go viral as a bad woman.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, Bright did not only beat her, but he never took responsibility for her upkeep for the many years of the marriage.\n\nSee Also News How My Pastor Lured, Married My Wife Of Over 12 Years \u2013 Church Member Laments\n\nShe said she separated from her husband several months before she eventually met Pastor Adeeyo who she claimed had now brought her joy.\n\nTina, in the video, tried to exonerate Adeeyo from all the blames as she advised other women who were being maltreated in their marriages to leave for their safety.\n\nShe said, \u201cI borrowed money for him (Bright). He asked me to borrow money, and I borrowed money in my school. I'm still paying the debt till date. The money I borrowed, it's this pastor now that is footing the bill. I borrowed money for his sake; his children's school fees that have piled up, I'm paying it. I'm still in debt till now. Go to Holy Child School and ask, they are all aware of the story, it didn't end there.\n\n\u201dWe later moved to the house where we are living now; feeding is a problem in the house. Ask Bright if he has ever given me money for upkeep since I married him 11 years ago, even if it is N5,000. Go and ask Bright if he has done anything but I don't complain; it's normal. He may not have it, I kept living my life, surviving but that didn't stop there.\n\n\u201cThis same Bright, after one year, I returned to him where he took me to a church he wanted to be attending and asked me to leave my church. During the Pandemic, he said I shouldn't go anywhere. He said men were chasing me and I was chasing men.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me one morning and said there was no marriage between us, that I was just in his house wasting his time; that I was a smelly thing. He chased me out of our room, he said he would make my life miserable.\n\n\u201cBright, you came on social media to tarnish an innocent man's image. You've done your worst, you want to get fame. You are bent on destroying me but let me tell you, this is my rising moment. You have said, over your dead body will you see me standing right and fulfilling my destiny, you threw me in the garbage but the seed you threw in the garbage find a means of growing and becoming something.\n\n\u201cI moved to my mother's house on the 28th of November, 2020. Pastor Moses Adeeyo was not in the picture, I had nothing with him. As I left Bright's house, I went to my mother's house, Bright knew I was in my mother's house.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that Ben Bright in a social media post accused his pastor of \u201csnatching\u201d his wife.\n\nHe had stated that he came across photographs of the pastor and his wife of 11 years now married after he and his wife had some issues and had gone to the pastor for some assistance.",

The truth of the matter is that if we ramp up testing today, there will be more cases.\n\n\u201cSecond reason for the high cases is that people have actually let down their guards. We are no longer obeying non-pharmaceutical interventions such as washing of hands regularly with soap and water or sanitising of hands when that (washing of hand) is not available.\u201d\n\nThe minister said Nigerians have relaxed their guard despite an increased number of infections certifying that the country is experiencing a third wave.\n\n\u201cIf over 4.2 million people have been lost to the virus world-wide and it is not abating. So we need to take more seriousness on the protocols around COVID-19 especially on non-pharmaceutical interventions,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome countries are even having the 4th and the 5th waves. It is not unique to Nigeria. Because when you look at the wave, like last Saturday it was 1000 plus and now going to 18000 cases in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the last four weeks in particular, we have witnessed so much increase even globally. So far, we are witnessing almost four million every week globally and from daily cases of about 540,000, we are now witnessing 570,000 daily worldwide.\n\n\u201cSo really, Nigeria is already in the third wave and this case has been compounded by Delta variant. And we have identified the Delta variant in several states in Nigeria also.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant is about 60 times more potent than the wide COVID II. And it is very virulent, deadly and more easily transmissible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt appears that while the normal variant will take about seven days to manifest, the delta variant manifests within two days of being infected. So, it is a real challenge for us. But the PSC is not resting on its oars to ensure that they give out necessary directive to national response team to tackle this virus.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said Nigeria is not seeking donations to procure COVID vaccines.",

          "title": "Adam Molai, leading Zimbabwean investor on making funding more accessible to startups",
          "text": "By the age of ten, Adam Molai had learnt that the only way to have his own money was to engage in trading.\n\nHe grew up spending his holidays working in his father\u2019s supermarket in Zimbabwe. It was through this experience that he learnt the fundamental principle of business: demand and supply. Selling items he bought from his father\u2019s supermarket at a higher price in a different part of the town meant he always had money.\n\nYears later after obtaining a degree in business from Lakehead University in Canada he returned to Zimbabwe to start the Pacific Cigarette company (formerly Savannah Tobacco). His company went on to break the monopoly that British American Tobacco had in Southern Africa. So far the Pacific Cigarette company has directly created over 250 jobs and contributed to about $100m worth of tobacco exports from Zimbabwe, Africa\u2019s largest producer and exporter of tobacco.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and through Jua Fund, he has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove and many others.\n\nThis edition of Ask an Investor is an adaptation of a TechCabal Live conversation between TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and Adam Molai.\n\nSeed funding makes up a significant portion of VC funding in Africa, between 2014 \u2013 2020 they accounted for a third of VC funding in Africa. However, when you look at the investment size they\u2019re mostly small cheque size deals because interest in the space is still growing amidst many challenges like lack of context about investing in African startups and poor fund management on the part of startups.\n\nIn this conversation, Adam Molai answered different questions about dealing with the challenges of early-stage investment in startups both from an investor and startup perspective.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What do you look for when deciding who to invest in?\n\nAdam Molai: Most importantly we look at the passion of the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship is a tough journey that tests you in ways you never imagined. Unless you\u2019re truly passionate about the project, the likelihood of staying through the project is little.\n\nWe look at their knowledge of the business, from a macro and micro perspective. Do they know who the current players are? How can their product come in and create a blue ocean in this industry? Ultimately, if you\u2019re not differentiated you\u2019re not competitive.\n\nHow deeply have they thought through their implementation because every idea is a great idea but it\u2019s how you implement it. Have they gone beyond the what and gotten into answering how they ensure they see this project through? They need to know who is going to do what and what skills they need to see this project through, also when and how they plan to get the skills.\n\nKK: How can policy makers improve the landscape for entrepreneurs?\n\nAM: Our landscape on the continent hasn\u2019t yet evolved to embrace us as Africans and our ideas. Rather it has developed to support foreign direct investments \u2014 foreigners coming to invest in our environment, not enough is being done to develop a framework that\u2019s aligned with local investors. My advice is to start looking at what the needs of local investors and foreign investors are. They need to lower the bar for local investors in terms of taxation and other incentives.\n\nWe need to have more confidence in our own people. One of the challenges local investors have is that regulators are familiar with them. They look at them and say, \u2018look at this young lad, I know him, he grew up in my village or town,\u2019 so already they\u2019ve minimized what you\u2019re presenting and already they\u2019re not taking you seriously. I think we need to take out some of the prejudices and stop seeing investors from a different environment or background as better.\n\nI think we need to start with the right mindset, then level the playing field for local and foreign investors. We should do this first before working on a framework that favours all.\n\nKK: What are some common misconceptions around early-stage investing in Africa and how they limit the opportunities available to startups\n\nAM: We don\u2019t look too far as entrepreneurs. Often we go conventional for example in the type of funding available. There\u2019s not enough work being done by entrepreneurs to look for alternative sources of funding. VC is still developing in Africa, if you look at 2020 alone, there was a 44% increase in tech rounds on the continent and there was a reduction in the total funding (from $2.2b in 2019 to $1.43b). That\u2019s $1.43b that very few of our local entrepreneurs are aware of.\n\nWhen we launched the Jua fund, within a month we had 700 applicants that came from the continent. Yes, 700 sounds significant, but compared to the number of people in need of funding, it doesn\u2019t look like people are out there hunting for funding. We need to move away from convention and encourage entrepreneurs and look at who is coming in with new sources of capital and how do we access these sources of capital.\n\nKK: How can African companies on the radar increase their prospects of attracting funding?\n\nAM: It starts with initiatives like the Jua fund, remember foreigners would take a cue from locals, so if foreigners see us as local investors showing confidence in our people then they\u2019ll come along as co-investors. One of the common issues foreign investors face is that they don\u2019t understand the African landscape. So if they see me as Adam, an African investing fellow Africans, they\u2019re more willing to come alongside me, knowing that I have a better understanding and knowledge of the African landscape.\n\nSo the more Africans we can get investing in the continent and entrepreneurs the more foreigners we\u2019re going to start attracting.\n\nKK: What has been your experience in funding early-stage startups and what are the best practices startups should adopt?\n\nAM: Let\u2019s start from the end. When startups start the application process they should be looking at what the due diligence requirements are. They should be thinking of the requirements that they need to fulfil upon successfully obtaining the fund.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund what should I put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\n\nIt\u2019s important that when pitches are being done, there\u2019s truthfulness in the submission. What you don\u2019t want is to go through a tough competition and then suddenly you can\u2019t raise funds because you\u2019ve been flagged as not being credible. I think it\u2019s important to state the difference between what\u2019s available in the present and what\u2019ll be available in the future.\n\nKK: What are some common mistakes investors make in selecting which startups to fund?\n\nAM: All that glitters is not gold. Investors often fall for presentation bias, some people are fantastic at presenting, others are not great at presenting but have a solid business. Over time investors have to be able to differentiate the substance from the hot air. Often because you\u2019re looking for passion, it\u2019s very easy to confuse passion for great presentation skills. We\u2019ve got to be able to separate the two. Investors need to develop a lens to differentiate the presentation and substance. Most times investors only note the lack of substance when they start going into deeper interrogation of the project, this is something that they could have picked up early on without the presentation bias.\n\nKK: For early-stage entrepreneurs what other challenges do you think they face outside funding?\n\nAM: We need to start walking the entrepreneurs from the stage of developing the ideas to turning it into a business. Also educating entrepreneurs to look at the problems they\u2019re solving using multiple lenses and thinking of different use cases for their solutions.\n\nFor example, there was an entrepreneur who sold computers that are solar powered but what we saw that was bigger than the solar panel computers was that each of these panels could serve as a base station for a very rudimentary cell network that has long distances.\n\nIn another scenario, there was a company that was producing Soy milk, which had no idea of how to increase its sales volumes. They then did some research and found that it helps reduce the strong pungent smells that come from some of the African food we eat. With this alternative use, they were better able to market their product and increased their sales volume.\n\nEarly-stage entrepreneurs should be thinking of how they can find alternative use cases so that as they\u2019re marketing their product they\u2019re finding multiple use cases and revenue streams.\n\nAudience: How can upcoming businesses thrive in an environment where the only lenders are short term lenders?\n\nAM: I\u2019m always reticent when it comes to short term funding because one of the most basic tenets of finance is what we call the matching principle. In this case, it has to do with matching the tenure of your requirements with the tenure of the financing that you seek. To seek short term funding for a long term project is like seeking short term funding to buy a house. If you get a short term funding how do you meet repayments? It means you\u2019re damned before you start.\n\nI believe for short term financing to work you need to have already negotiated that upon hitting some milestones,once you meet the short term condition you\u2019ll have access to long term funding.\n\nOnly in that case will I advise people to use short term funding, because their next level of funding has been fully assured, not promised or probable.\n\nAudience: How does a company balance timing between the transition from proof of concept to fundraising?\n\nAM: I think the right time is when you\u2019ve stress-tested your concept so that when you\u2019re approaching those people, you won\u2019t be approaching them as if you\u2019re coming to present a half baked product.\n\nThere are fewer things investors frown upon like someone who has walked two steps for a ten-step journey. There are certain minimums that should be there. You need to be sure that you\u2019ve stress-tested it from multiple angles and that it\u2019s robust enough.\n\nAudience: What is needed to change the landscape to accommodate bleeding edge technologies like quantum biotech and cleantech?\n\nAM: Right now, we invested $1m through the Jua fund into a big data supply chain entity. What did I know about big data and supply chains? What did our peers know about it? Very little. We took the leap because of the way the project was fully researched, thought through. They were very clear about the next steps they\u2019ll take to see it through. We took that leap of faith because the work has been done. As an investor, we don\u2019t need to fully understand. I remember telling them, I don\u2019t understand your business but I love it.\n\nThe concept and solution being presented were so clear that it was meeting a pain point that was in the market.\n\nAudience: Are investors keen and willing to embrace impact entrepreneurs?\n\nAM: Yes they are, what we\u2019re looking for are businesses that offer maximum impact for the continent. It can start in one industry but scale-out for other industries.\n\nRecently, I was speaking to an impact entrepreneur we\u2019ve backed with about $250k in. They built zero-emission cooking pallets and are selling carbon credits. Their solution solves the pollution and deforestation because people are cutting down trees to get wood for cooking\n\nAudience: What\u2019s the roadmap for the due diligence process for startups at different levels?\n\nAM: We see this a lot in tech, a lot of people go register in Delaware, then when they come and pitch to investors they come as a Nigerian company. Now expect that that company\u2019s due diligence would be done like that of a Nigerian company. Often only after further investigation do we notice that it\u2019s actually registered in Delaware, so we start asking for due diligence requirements for Delaware entities.\n\nI\u2019m just giving you a basic example of some due diligence issues that come up. There have been instances where the location of the founders is different from the location of the business. We\u2019re looking at the fact that you as the founder have to be on the ground running that business. How would you do that? There has to be some congruence with all your facts stated about your business?\n\nNow granted, sometimes companies need to have dual locations, for example, you\u2019re a fintech Nigerian company that\u2019s also registered in the United States.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do. you need to give a schematic that shows your company\u2019s architecture explaining why it\u2019s the way it is. What we don\u2019t want to do as investors is to invest in one entity not knowing that there are four entities. In some cases, the one you\u2019re investing in does all the spending, while the ones you haven\u2019t invested in generate all the profit. We need to be sure that the entire architecture is tied together.\n\nAudience: What\u2019s a startup you invested in but initially doubted in, how were you able to overcome this?\n\nAM: The ones that I can talk about aren\u2019t within the Jua Fund, because we only started dispersing funds two months ago. There was one instance where we couldn\u2019t fully understand a founder who approached us with an idea for a restaurant business. It was one of those moments where you say it\u2019s not a big investment, let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ve never been in the food industry and we said let\u2019s go for it.\n\nWhat we saw after investing and the evolution of the business was that, had it not been for COVID I believe they would have been able to roll it out as a franchise,\n\nAudience: How many milestones should a startup cross before approaching startups?\n\nAM: I\u2019ve always said the more data points that are available and presented, the stronger the picture you present. So my advice is to get as much done as is feasible without having to invest significant resources.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies.

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Investors that participated in the round include V&R Africa, Timon Capital, Tangerine Insurance, LoftyInc, Musha Ventures, SUNU Capital, Launch Africa, and Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat do they do? Using a mobile app, WhatsApp, and a phone number, Omnibiz digitises the retail supply chain connecting retailers directly to manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).\n\nFounded in 2019, Omnibiz is the brainchild of Deepankar Rustagi, who previously founded VConnect, an online marketplace for local professionals. Omnibiz operates an asset-light business model by working with distributors and logistics providers.\n\nWhen retailers place an order for a product, the third-party logistics drivers pick it from the distributors and deliver it to the retailers. In a chat with TechCrunch, Rustagi revealed that his experience at VConnect prepared him for the challenge of running Omnibiz.\n\nAfrica\u2019s eCommerce value chain is distorted, with no easy way to effectively provide goods and services. However, driven by an increasing Internet and smartphone penetration, entrepreneurs are beginning to do the hard work of digitising the space.\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on B2C models, recent happenings suggest a shift. Sokowatch, Twiga, MaxAB, and Trade Depot are just a few startups that have begun providing solutions for the B2B space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Nigerian eCommerce startup, Omnibiz, secures $3m seed to expand across West Africa.\n\nJumia Q2 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nWhat happened? eCommerce giant Jumia has released its second-quarter results, and there are interesting points to note.\n\nFirst, phones and electronics now account for less gross merchandise value (GMV) for the retailer, falling from 43% in the second quarter of 2020 to 38% in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nFood delivery and digital finance services offered via JumiaPay also saw growth contributing 14% of GMV in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 9% in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe retailer also saw an increase in its logistics offering, delivering 1.3 million packages to 300 clients compared to half a million packages delivered throughout 2020.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEighteen months ago, Africa-focused eCommerce giant, Jumia, changed its business strategy to something it deemed more effective. A focus on low-value/high-value products, and a drastic reduction in marketing expense helped it reduce losses significantly for up to six quarters.\n\nConversely, reduced marketing seemingly stunted Jumia\u2019s growth as its user base and the number of orders on its platform kept fluctuating. While its gross profit margins seemingly increased YoY, there was inconsistent growth on a quarterly basis.\n\nLet\u2019s paint a quick picture:\n\nIn one year, the company only added 500,000 active users \u2013 people who placed orders, irrespective of cancellations or returns. Nine months before this change in strategy, Jumia added 1.3 million active users year-on-year (YoY) on average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers and investor sentiments which quickly moved from bullish to bearish led us to question the effectiveness of Jumia\u2019s push towards profitability.\n\nPer its Q2 2020 report released today, August 8, 2021, Jumia appears to have made a slight tweak to its growth strategy, spending a whopping $17.1 million on sales and advertising.\n\nNote: Jumia has historically used the Euros to report its financials, but it has stated that it will be using the US dollar going forward. Consequently, the numbers for previous reports have been modified\n\nJeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Jumia stated that in the past 18 months, the company has significantly diversified its product categories, improved unit economics, and strengthened its balance sheet. It plans to build on this by increasing sales and advertising investments while increasing gross profits.\n\n\u201cWhile we start to see early signs of usage acceleration, these investments are long term in nature and we expect them to pay out over time, as we continue to execute on our strategy,\u201d both CEOs proffered.\n\nThe plan, for them, is to make Jumia a part of their customer\u2019s everyday lives by engaging both buyers and sellers in the variety of services it offers.\n\nThe company reveals that customer targeting on Facebook and Google has been a big part of its campaign, and it plans to leverage geotargeting tools for outdoor advertising, as well as various customer incentives.\n\nThe result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Jumia added up to 200,000 active customers YoY to reach 7 million, this is just 100,000 more than the 6.9 million customers it had in Q1 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Jumia\u2019s aggressive marketing helped drive several orders on its platform. Orders \u2013 items ordered irrespective of returns and cancellations \u2014 increased 12.8% from last year to 7.6 million. This is 1 million orders more than it processed in Q1 2021.\n\nWhile phones and electronics have continued to decline, and FMCGs are not growing as fast, Jumia has witnessed explosive growth in food delivery.\n\n\u201cFood delivery posted the highest ever number of quarterly orders, up almost 60% year-over-year and accounting for 22% of total orders on our platform during the quarter.\n\nJumia reveals that it focused its growth efforts in this segment late last year after the disruption experienced at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) declined 11% from $253 million last year to $223.5 million. Still, this is a marked improvement from $200 million in Q1 2021.\n\nJumia also cites Foreign Exchange activities such as an increase in currency valuations for Ivory Coast, South Africa, and Morocco, against the US Dollar as a key driver for GMV performance.\n\nConsumer electronics and gadgets accounted for 37% of Jumia\u2019s GMV, while groceries accounted for 14%. JumiaPay, its much-vaunted digital financial services platform, was the GMV\u2019s increased its GMV contribution to 25%.\n\nJumiaPay transactions grew by 12% from 2.4 million last year to 2.7 million in Q2 2021. However, total payment volume reduced from $59 million to $56 million.\n\nEncouragingly, Jumia\u2019s gross profit after fulfillment expense (picking, packing, and shipping costs) increased 16% from $6.6 million to 7.7 million YoY. In Q1 2021 it recorded a $7.5 gross profit after fulfillment.\n\nLosses have increased once again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange for a slight increase in customer base, gross profit, and increased orders on the platform, Jumia\u2019s losses have risen significantly.\n\nThe company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss increased by 15% from $36.2 million in Q2 2020 to $41.6 million in Q2 2021.\n\nWhen Taxes, Interests, and other parameters are accounted for, Jumia was left with an operating loss of $51.6 million in Q2 2021, up 24.7% from the same period last year.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Jumia attributes these significant losses to increased sales and advertising expenses.\n\n\u201cAt the end of June 30, 2021, we had $637.7 million of cash on our balance sheet. Cash used in operating and investing activities was $27.4 million,\u201d the company reports.\n\nWhat does the future look like?\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, we expect to increase our investments in Sales and Advertising, Technology and staff costs expenses as compared to the second half of 2020.\u201d Jumia states.\n\nRecall that in the six months leading to March 2021, Jumia sold off $570 million worth of shares in order to raise extra cash. While we initially stated that the implications were not obvious, such a runaway might be necessary for a period of significant losses that might follow an aggressive marketing period.\n\nWhile both CEOs aver that this will drive long-term growth, it is worth noting that this is not a new strategy, and Jumia has always employed this before toning things down 18 months ago.\n\nIs this sustainable? It might be too soon to say, but we\u2019ll likely see Jumia adjust its strategy in a few months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

We are doing enumeration and biometric data capturing of the pupils enrolled under the programme, getting feedbacks from cooks and head-teachers within the programme.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep an up-to-date record of the programme and make it more responsive as well as meet the beneficiaries to get real-time feedback from them as well.\n\n\u201cThe current enumeration and bio-data capturing is a building block towards the expansion of the programme to include more pupils and schools in the state.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari had earlier announced his laudable intention of an additional 5 million pupils to be enrolled in the programme nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe ministry also wants to know how the programme is being managed on daily basis, the resources available and if there are shortfalls before the expansion would be done in order to tighten loose ends,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister said that the programme, which started on Feb. 8, 2017, in the state, had pushed up enrollment figures in public schools and increased the daily attendance to school.\n\n\u201cThe programme has helped in the concentration of the pupils during classes since some of them do not feed or are underfed at home before coming to school each day,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nFarouq said that currently, the programme is having 9,196,823 pupils nationwide, with a total of 107,000 cooks supplying the food, which is indigenous and home-made for the pupils nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe programme has a lot of multiplier effects. It has assisted farmers to expand food production and employ more hands in the farms as well as the cooks also employing more hands to assist them,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nSpeaking, the Headmistress of the primary school, Mrs Salome Obi, said that the pupils were \u2018very happy\u2019 to be part of the programme, adding that apart from increasing enrollment, \u201cit has helped in pupils\u2019 retention ability\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter eating the meals each day, you see the pupils enlivened and eager to continue with their learning rather than feeling dull or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Obi said.\n\nA cook in the programme, Mrs Uzoamaka Ogbu, thanked the Federal Government for engaging her and other women in the programme, which had helped to improve the welfare of their families and other dependents.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we are having is the issue of non-regular payment and the current cost of food stuff in the market, which the N70 per meal (with a fruit) remained inadequate with market realities,\u2019\u2019 Ogbu said.\n\nA pupil, Miss Flavour Anigbo, prayed God to bless and protect President Buhari for providing food for her and her classmates.\n\n\u201cThe feeding makes us happy each day in school. We want them to keep it up and God to bless President Muhammadu Buhari for us,\u2019\u2019 Anigbo said.\n\nThe ministry monitoring and enumerating team later went to a primary school complex within Idaw River area in Enugu South Local Government with five primary schools.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA former federal minister of Works, Adeseye Ogunlewe, has said the inability of the people of south-east Nigeria to come together under a leadership would hamper their chances of producing a president in 2023.\n\nMr Ogunlewe, who spoke on Arise TV\u2019s The Morning Show programme Wednesday, said the Igbos of south-east Nigeria must invest in party politics to stand a good chance at the next general election.\n\n\u201cAnother set of people that are appropriate, they are the people from the southeast but they have the problem of leadership,\u201d said Mr Ogunlewe, 77, a member of the All Progressives Congress who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party in 2019.\n\n\u201cThey are so endowed that they are spread all over Nigeria and they can gather a lot of votes, but they are too divided. An Imo person, an Enugu person, an Ebonyi man will not listen to themselves.\n\n\u201cThey have the money. If they sit down and aggregate what they can offer, they have more money than almost everybody in Nigeria. But have you seen one person from the south-east that said \u2018I am interested in the presidency, I will start to campaign all over Nigeria immediately, raise money for me?\u2019 and influence the structure of the party?\u201d\n\nAhead of the 2023 presidential election, some of the prominent names that have come up as likely presidential aspirants from the south-east include Peter Obi and Rochas Okorocha, former governors of Anambra and Imo states respectively, and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, among others.\n\nLast June, Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and ex-presidential candidate, officially declared his intention to run for president in 2023.\n\nThe two major political parties in the country \u2013 the APC and PDP \u2013 have also begun moves to organise a national convention in preparation for 2023. While the PDP has scheduled October as the convention date, the APC is yet to decide.\n\nMr Ogunlewe, an Alliance for Democracy Senator in 1999, maintained that the way to stand a chance in the 2023 presidential contest is to be actively involved in party politics.\n\n\u201cIf you are not investing in the structure of the party, forget it because he who pays the piper dictates the tune. They are now having conventions in the two political parties, if you are interested in the presidency of Nigeria, this is your time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou must invest in that structure, you must be able to determine who is going to be part of that structure because they are the ones to do the zoning, they are the ones to do the convention to pick a presidential candidate, so if you are not part of them, you are out. So if any easterner is interested, let him start now to invest in the structure of the party.\u201d",

          "text": "Former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha has described as absurd, an order of Imo State High Court for permanent forfeiture of properties belonging to him, noting that the judge couldn\u2019t have delivered judgment in a case he never heard.\n\nRecall that a state High Court in Owerri, earlier today ordered the final and absolute forfeiture of Royal Palm Springs Hotel and other properties said to belong to Okorocha and other members of his family.\n\nThe forfeited properties are contained in pages 226 to 272 of the Imo state Government white paper report by a Judicial Commission of Enquiry on Recovery of Lands and other related matters.\n\nAccording to the ruling by Justice Fred Njemanze, who was sitting as a vacation judge, Okorocha\u2019s counsel failed to give concrete and verifiable reasons why a final and absolute forfeiture order should not be given in favour of the Imo state government.\n\nJustice Njemanze had added that the suit filed against Imo state Government by Okorocha\u2019s counsel was not properly filed.\n\nHe also described it as a surplusage, a term in law which means a useless statement completely irrelevant to a matter.\n\nJustice Njemanze maintained that the white paper gazette by the Imo state Government is a legal binding document, concluding that there was no concrete reason before it why the forfeiture should not be made absolute and final, hence the Imo state Government can go ahead and do whatever it deems fit to do with the properties.\n\nAs for persons who might have made purchase on such properties, Justice Njamanze said they are at liberty to approach the court to prove their titles.\n\nHowever, reacting to the judgment in a statement by his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha said the judgement is a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018Justice Fred Njemanze of High Court Owerri gave judgement in a matter he never heard, less than 24 hours to his retirement today, August 10, 2021,\u201d Okorocha said the judge gave the judgement as a parting gift to the state government.\n\nHe vowed to approach relevant agencies \u201cto investigate the judgement and prove him or us right or wrong.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cOn Tuesday, August 3, 2021, Justice Njemanze sat. The lawyers in the matter argued on the preliminary objection. Chief Obah Maduabuchi, SAN, was Okorocha\u2019s Lawyer and Chief Louis Alozie (SAN) was for the Imo State Government.\n\n\u201cJustice Njemanze reserved ruling on the Preliminary objection and told the lawyers that they would be Communicated on the date. He also told other lawyers who had applied to be joined for their clients, to wait until after the ruling on the preliminary objection.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, August 4, 2021, the Court Clerk sent text messages to the lawyers that the Court would sit on Friday, August 6, 2021 for the lawyers to adopt their processes, instead of the expected ruling on the Preliminary objection.\n\n\u201cOn the Friday, August 6, 2021, Lawyers were in Court. Justice Njemanze did not come. He did not sit that day. Lawyers left and those involved left.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, on the Friday, August 6, 2021, neither the expected ruling on the Preliminary objection was given, nor the adoption of the processes as Contained in the text messages of Wednesday, August 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, August 9, 2021, while lawyers in the matter were expecting to hear from the Court on the issue of date, the news came that Justice Njemanze had given Judgement in a substantive suit he never heard and not also on the Preliminary objection, even when lawyers had not adopted their processes.\n\n\u201cIn the Contentious forfeiture Order Justice Njemanze gave on February 24, 2021, only five properties were directly linked to Okorocha and family, including Eastern Palm University and Royal Spring Palm hotel.\n\n\u201cBut, both Justice Njemanze and the Imo State government had talked about pages 226 to 272 of the aberration called the WHITEPAPER, as Containing Okorocha\u2019s Properties. This is bare blackmail. It is not true.\n\n\u201cWe have meticulously gone through pages 226 to 272 of their WHITEPAPER. The pages contained layouts and estates and none belonged to Okorocha and the family.\n\n\u201cSome of those who own these properties in the interim forfeiture order are also in various courts and like we said, some of them had also applied to Justice Njemanze to be joined. But Justice Njemanze told them to wait until he ruled on the preliminary objection. But he went ahead to give Judgement in the substantive matter he never heard. This is absurd.\n\n\u201cIn the Contentious Judgement, he gave absolute forfeiture order on the properties in question, in a matter he never heard and which matters on them, have been going on in Courts of Competent Jurisdiction. And in less than 24 hours to his retirement today being Tuesday, August 10, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we are hearing that a Judge could give Judgement in a matter or case he never heard. This is not good for the Society and for the judicial system.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator Seriake Dickson has explained that he was at the office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to clarify some issues related to assets declaration.\n\nThe former Bayelsa State leader was at the office of the anti-graft agency in Abuja on Tuesday upon the invitation of the agency. He was later released to go home.\n\nIn a statement he issued later in the day, Senator Seriake noted that a non-governmental organization had petitioned the EFCC over some of his assets which they claimed were not declared.\n\n\u201cI understand that the subject matter of the inquiry relates to investments of my family trust, which I incorporated while being a member of the House of Reps to hold my family assets and investments which were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor,\u201d the lawmaker representing Bayelsa West, added.\n\n\u201cI understand that there is a petition from an NGO alleging that these investments (largely buildings, plots, farms, etc in my village, Orua, Yenagoa, and two buy-to-let houses in the UK) were not declared. I have a duty to clarify these issues with the investigating authorities who by law have the responsibility to inquire into these matters.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the said his family investments were made before he became the leader of the the oil-rich state and that these assets were declared to the right quarters before and after he left office.\n\n\u201cMy solicitors and those of the trust have written to the EFCC to clarify these issues with the accompanying documents,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, on getting to the EFCC office, the investigating team made fresh allegation of a diversion of N17.5 billion flood funds in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe petition further alleged that the money was used for my re-election in 2019. The fact is that there was no such donation about the 2012 flood in Bayelsa,\u201d the statement further said.\n\n\u201cCuriously, there was no mention of donor or where the money came from. There was also no re-election for governorship in Bayelsa in 2019 which are clear proofs that the petition was totally frivolous.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC, he said, is \u201clooking into these allegations\u201d.\n\nREAD FULL STATEMENT About two weeks ago I received an invitation from the EFCC to clarify some issues relating to assets declarations as alleged by an NGO. On account of our busy schedule at the time, I wrote to inform them and we agreed to reschedule the interview for today. As a law abiding citizen and with a life long commitment to supporting Law enforcement and security agencies, I honored the invitation today as rescheduled. I understand that the subject matter of the inquiry relates to investments of my family trust, which I incorporated while being a member of the House of Reps to hold my family assets and investments which were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor. I understand that there is a petition from an NGO alleging that these investments (largely buildings, plots, farms, etc in my village, Orua, Yenagoa, and two buy-to-let houses in the UK) were not declared. I have a duty to clarify these issues with the investigating authorities who by law have the responsibility to inquire into these matters. However, for the avoidance of doubts, let me state that my family investments, Seriake Dickson Trust Incorporated were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor. These investments were funded by loans and advances and repaid from salaries, allowances, savings and others. One of them is still on mortgage and I have made these documents available to the EFCC. These investments were declared in my assets declaration form at the House of Reps in 2011; my Governorship form in 2012, 2016, 2020 after I left office and the Senate Assets declaration form this year. I went beyond these declarations and wrote several letters to the appropriate agencies, copies of which have been made available to the EFCC. My trust and I subscribed to the federal government Voluntary Assets Income AND Declaration Scheme (VAIDES) and also paid the necessary taxes. As a result of blackmail from some quarters, the Trust and I went to the Federal High Court where there is a subsisting judgement declaring that no Nigerian law is breached by a public officer who takes loans and other verifiable avenues to make investments for his family provided these are declared. It should be on record that I have since resigned from the Trust Administration since 2011 before I became Governor. My solicitors and those of the trust have written to the EFCC to clarify these issues with the accompanying documents. However on getting to the commission, the investigating team came up with a new allegation of diversion of flood funds in 2012 totaling N17.5 billion. The petition further alleged that the money was used for my re-election in 2019. The fact is that there was no such donation about the 2012 flood in Bayelsa. Curiously, there was no mention of donor or where the money came from. There was also no re-election for governorship in Bayelsa in 2019 which are clear proofs that the petition was totally frivolous. The commission after looking into these allegations have since asked me to return home on self recognition. I have authorized this statement to be released for the avoidance of any misinformation.

They insisted on following the due legal processes and said without going to court, they cannot hand over Igboho to you.\n\n\u201cThis is how it should be under the law; the judge will scrutinise Nigeria\u2019s extradition request from Cotonou to Abuja.\n\n\u201cThat was why I criticised the hasty transfer of IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu from Kenya to Nigeria.

          "text": "The federal government has so far spent N502.3 billion as COVID-19 intervention fund, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed has said.\n\nThe minister announced this Tuesday at the proposed national dialogue on COVID-19 economic impact and assessment of national and states\u2019 recovery plan and policy options in Abuja.\n\nShe said Nigeria was hard hit by the global health crisis which caused a fall in crude oil prices.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cYou know that in the 2020 budget, N500 billion was appropriated and it was fully funded, but apart from that we also have the economic sustainability plan that is totalling N2.3 billion which is in the form of intervention funds from the CBN, which means loans are given to the private sector and they pay back later.\u201d\n\nHajiya Ahmed said the pandemic had made it imperative for the government to fix its health sector.\n\nShe said the health crisis resulted in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration taking proactive and people-oriented policies with emphasis on human capital development and critical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has required that we take a critical look at our health and economic policies, to swiftly introduce crisis management measures, catalyze support to the health sector, and accelerate certain key reforms while reimagining others entirely.\n\n\u201cSeveral fiscal measures were put in place to balance health and economic issues in addressing the burden of COVID-19 on Macro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), as part of the integrated policy framework which ensures coherence in fiscal, economy and health positions,\u201d Hajiya Ahmed said.\n\nThe minister listed the key interventions to include; the establishment of a N500 billion COVID-19 crisis intervention fund to finance the upgrade and improvement of healthcare facilities; creation of a Special Public Works Programme to employ 774,000 people, among several others.\n\nBesides, Ahmed said, the government would continue to make critical investments in key sectors including agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education to provide jobs for millions of unemployed youths as well as support SMEs.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we are focusing on enabling digital transformation and disruptive innovation, a key driver for MSME innovation and scale up across the country,\u201d she added.\n\nShe assured that the ministry would partner with \u201cSEDIN in its support to national and sub-national Governments in Nigeria. In particular, the continued empowerment of micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) is a critical driver for building back better in Nigeria and across the African continent. We look forward to receiving the final report of today\u2019s Dialogue and the results.\u201d\n\nIn her address, representative of GIZ SEDIN head of programme, Ana Vinambres, said the SEDIN programme had helped to attract funds for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and small holder farmers through bank loans and access to inputs.\n\n\u201cThe SEDIN programme has also widely contributed to the immediate, medium and long term response to COVID19, including the facilitation of funds for MSMEs and farmers to cover their immediate liquidity issues from government\u2019s targeted facilities, commercial banks and impact investors, the access to raw Inputs and compost production at a time when trade was impacted, facilitating linkages to open markets and identifying collection centers closed to producers to avoid profiteering.\n\n\u201cIn the medium term, SEDIN NICOP supported the setting-up of the online Om tor coordinated Covid-19 Impact investment responses,\u201d she said.\n\nVinambres said while \u201cCOVID-19 is still here with us, it is important to look at additional ways to support MSMES resilience, create new jobs and fast track economic recovery.\u201d\n\nShe said the organisation was committed to taking forward the recommendations of the dialogue as \u201cwe are open as well to further support and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders.\u201d\n\n25 countries meet on restrictions\n\nMeanwhile, 25 countries have taken steps to address the unavailability and restriction of vaccines to some countries, especially in developing countries to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese countries include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, the Philippines, Serbia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan, convened the first International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation to ensure fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, and increase the vaccine production capacity of developing countries.\n\nChinese state Councillor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, who chaired the meeting with the theme: \u201cStrengthening International Cooperation on Vaccines, Promoting Fair and Equitable Distribution of Vaccines around the World,\u201d stated that every country must have access to the vaccine.\n\n\u201cIn the battle, vaccines are of vital importance. They should be distributed around the world fairly and equitably with no country and no one left behind. They should truly serve as people\u2019s vaccines. This is essential for defeating the virus. It is also a matter of international justice,\u201d he said.\n\nYi revealed that China had been providing vaccines to countries in need since September 2020 and since donated vaccines to over 100 countries and exporting vaccines to over 60 countries, with a total of over 770 million doses, ranking first in the world.\n\nHe stated that four Chinese vaccines had been approved for use in over 100 countries and international authorities recognised their safety and effectiveness.\n\n\u201cChina acted quickly to work with other developing countries on vaccine production. The UAE, Egypt, Indonesia and Brazil have become the first country in their respective region to have COVID vaccine production capacity. Together, we have created another success story of developing countries seeking strength through solidarity. China has also provided vaccines to COVAX, UN peacekeepers and the International Olympic Committee,\u201d he said\n\nHe, therefore, called on world leaders to tap into the opportunity to ensure COVID-19 vaccines become available to all.\n\n\u201cRecently, China launched an Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation. We welcome the participation of more countries.\u201d\n\nA joint statement of the International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation issued at the end of the meeting, recognised solidarity and cooperation as crucial to fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe must champion the vision of building a global community of health for all, put people and their lives first and make concerted and coordinated efforts to address the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe call upon all countries, in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, to increase national, regional and global capacities, carry out vaccine research and development as well as production in line with strict standards according to the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, and provide safe, effective and high-quality COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nPhase 2 vaccination commences\n\nIn a related development, the second phase of COVID-19 vaccination will commence August 16, Executive Director National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Dr Faisal Shuaib has said.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at a media parley in Abuja, Dr Shuaib stated that the second phase vaccination would take off at 8am at FCMB, Jabi, Abuja.\n\nHe said Nigeria received 4, 00,080 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine donated by the government of the United States and another 176,000 doses of the vaccine of Johnson & Johnson vaccines were expected Wednesday.\n\nThe NPHCDA boss said the 176, 000 doses were coming out of the 29,850,000 doses the federal government procured from the AFREXIM Bank through the African Union.\n\n\u201cIn the 1st phase of vaccination rollout, the collaboration between NAFDAC and NPHCDA led to the first ever tracking and tracing of vaccines globally.\n\n\u201cThis tracking and tracing of vaccines from the national to sub national level and to the point of administration was conducted for the first time in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is why when we had said we had finished the 1st phase of the vaccination on the 9thof July, it was that there were no vaccines available anywhere and this kind of accountability is what we want to replicate in the phase 2 of the vaccination,\u201d Shuaib said.\n\nHe stated that NAFDAC took the samples of the vaccine to test for integrity and consistency in line with global standard \u201cto ensure it is in line with the product information that has been provided by the US government and Moderna.\u201d\n\nHe said NAFDAC had approved the Moderna vaccine for use.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we want to call on all Nigerians to remain assured that the vaccine that we have are safe and will be deployed next week as earlier communicated. The flag-off and roll out of the 2nd phase of the COVID-19 vaccination programme will be done on August 16th, 2021,\u2019\u2019 the agency said.\n\nHe further said the agency was wrapping up the training of about 40, 739 health workers across the national, state and ward levels \u201con the take-off of the phase 2 strategic vaccine roll out plan with focus on improving the delivery, communication, data management of the vaccine and logistics that are needed.\u201d",

          "title": "Interrogating diplomacy as a tool to dismantle insurgency in West Africa -NigPilot",
          "text": "The idea that wars, conventional or otherwise more often than not, end on a table of discussion other than the battlefield cannot be farther from the truth.\n\nHowever, this narrative of discussion or negotiation is multilayered. It could be a negotiation between the government and rebels or terrorists, depending on the scenario. Or between the government and superpowers who control the arms sales.\n\nIn West Africa, for example, no member nation is advanced in manufacturing military hardware, and these wars are fought with modern weaponry. To this end, all the nations in the sub-region are dependent on the superpowers for their supply of the latest military weapons, the same way the non-state actors are also relying on these same manufacturers to stock their arsenal.\n\nUnfortunately, there are instances where nations are denied access to the arms market to tackle terrorism or insurgency in their countries on account of human right violation by state forces.\n\nThis is even when these criminal elements have unrestricted access to some of this modern weaponry though through unconventional methods or what is popularly known as black market or back door channel.\n\nTo prevent a scenario where nations are denied access to the needed military hardware to suffocate these terrorists under the guise of human rights abuses, diplomatic negotiation becomes imperative.\n\nIt is, nonetheless, on the premise of the foregoing that serving and retired foreign relations practitioners under the aegis of Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) chose \u201cThe Role of Diplomacy in Combating Terrorism and Insurgency in West Africa,\u201d as the topic for its 2021 annual lecture/conference.\n\nDelivering the lecture in Abuja, Africa\u2019s famous diplomat and immediate past Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Dr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas tasked the ECOWAS Member States to as a matter of tactics look beyond the surface in tackling terrorism, insurgency, and banditry in their domains.\n\nHe said that member states need a renewed commitment to look beyond terrorism as a tactic and address the underlying conditions and drivers that enable it to sustain and spread.\n\nDr. Chambas who was the Guest Lecturer also noted that while nothing can justify violent extremism, it does not exist in a vacuum.\n\n\u201cAs stated in the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, \u2018narrative of grievance, actually perceived injustice, promised empowerment and sweeping changes become attractive where human rights are being violated, good governance is being ignored and aspirations are being crushed\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe use of diplomacy as a counter-terrorism effort must therefore include efficient and effective negotiations skills that do not solely focus on forcing conflicting parties into accepting and signing peace packs. Enhancing sustained peace and conflict resolutions aimed at combating terrorism and insurgency through diplomacy is therefore improved when the negotiations\u2019 table provides the ground for the potential of socio-economic and conflict transformation to the benefit of grassroots communities,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said that the manifestation of diplomacy as a resilient tool in the mitigation of terrorism and insurgency in West Africa is consolidated in the strenuous efforts adopted by several peace actors.\n\nThese actors he noted include the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU), the European Union (EU), the United Nations, and a number of bilateral partners who have contributed to the development and introduction of several strategies to counter and combat rising threats of terrorism and insurgency in the Sahel.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of AFRPN, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammed Bande said that fighting insurgency in Nigeria without addressing the same in Niger or Chad would amount to act in futility.\n\nThe Commandant, National Defence College Rear Admiral OB Daji that Non-state actors and terrorist groups across West Africa, especially in Nigeria, the Lake Chad region, Mali and Burkina Faso represent a sustained challenge to the authority of the various States in West Africa as well as the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their countries.\n\nQuoting UNDP data, Rear Admiral Daji disclosed that Boko Haram has killed some 350,000 people in Nigeria between 2009 and 2020, with 3 million people displaced and 310,000 refugees in various camps during the same period.\n\nHe further revealed that this is in addition to properties, both private and public, that have been destroyed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe twin scourge has also led to mass disruption of economic activities, including farming (crops and animal husbandry). Other countries badly affected by terrorism and insurgency in the region have suffered a similar experiences in varying degrees. Against this background, any forum that is devoted to finding solutions to the twin scourges of Terrorism and Insurgency, as of today\u2019s event, must be applauded. This is why I am very pleased to be here to make these few remarks from the perspective of the National Defence College (NDC), Nigeria as far as the role of diplomacy in combating terrorism and insurgency in the West African region is concerned.\n\n\u201cIt is our firm belief that the menace of terrorism and insurgency in West Africa and, indeed, other parts of the world cannot be effectively tackled unless governments combine both kinetic and non-kinetic measures in such a manner that guarantees sustained action. The two challenges have also assumed cross-border, international dimensions, such that no one country can solve them alone without collaborating with others. Diplomacy is an essential element of national power, in addition to Information, Military, and the Economy (DIME) which can be deployed to address these challenges. Diplomacy as a tool for negotiation and the use of peaceful means of resolving conflicts through engagement has therefore become a sine qua non for finding lasting solutions to the challenges,\u201d The Commandant explained.\n\nEarlier in a pre-conference press briefing, the President, Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) Ambassador Gani Lawal said the annual lecture/conference is designed to interrogate issues of the moment by experienced Foreign Relations Practitioners.\n\nHe said that the Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) is made up of retired and serving Nigerian diplomats and all stakeholders in the business of Foreign Relations.\n\nThe President also explained what the association is set out to accomplish, \u201cour aim is to impact the foreign policy of Nigeria in a positive way from the perspectives of reasoned options emanating from the synergy and brainstorming exercise of experienced practitioners through lectures, workshop, and publications as well as mentoring of upcoming diplomats\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria and indeed other West African countries had been plagued with the scourge of terrorism, insurgency, and other trans-border crimes, hence the relevance of the topic of this year\u2019s lecture which was designed to proffer diplomatic solutions to the identified scourge\u201d.\n\nHe also explained that \u201cThis topic has been carefully selected to create an opportunity to listen to the perspectives of diplomatic professionals who have been in the front line of combating terrorism and insurgency. The guest lecturer is no less a personality than the former chairman of ECOWAS Commission, Ambassador Ibn Chambas and the chairman of the occasion is current Nigeria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Prof Tijjani Muhammed Bande\u201d.",

It is a known fact that in the recent past, over 1,000 members of Boko Haram and their families have surrendered to the troops due to the intense pressure from troops\u2019 sustained offensive actions. Among those were key leaders of the terrorist group who have renounced their membership and have turned themselves in.\n\n\u201cThe NA being a professional military organisation will continue to act in accordance with the dictates of the Nigerian Constitution, as well as international best practices.

          "text": "At least 112 persons have been killed and about 160 kidnapped following bloody attacks in Kaduna and Plateau states within the last one month, Amnesty International has said.\n\nAccording to a communique on Tuesday, the rights organization attributed the deaths to failure on the part of Nigerian authorities to live up to their obligation to protect the right to life.\n\nAmnesty International stated that the authorities\u2019 failure enabled a month of bloody attacks on both farmers and herders, in parts of Kaduna and Plateau states.\n\n\u201cAt least 112 people were killed, 160 abducted and thousands displaced in communities in Kaduna and Plateau states from July to 5 August 2021.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that despite clear signs that there will be retaliatory attacks, enough is not being done to prevent the bloodshed, thereby fueling the ongoing circle of violence. Beyond issuing statements and condemning attacks after they happen; government needs to rein in on attackers and bring suspects to justice,\u201d said Osai Ojigho, Director Amnesty International Nigeria.\n\nThe NGO\u2019s further noted that its investigation shows at least 78 people were killed and 160 abducted by bandits between 3 July and 5 August 2021 in Kaduna state including 121 school children of Bethel Baptist Church High School.\n\nThe communique adds that no fewer than 34 persons lost their lives in Plateau state, including 7 herders who were attacked on 1 July at Dogon Gaba and 2 others who were lynched at Fusa Village while trying to locate their missing cow.\n\n\u201cVillagers from farming communities, informed Amnesty International that, innocent people and communities that know nothing about the attacks are sometimes targeted for reprisal.\n\n\u201cA retaliatory attack on 31 July and 1 August 2021, led to the killing of at least 17 people, and displacements of hundreds in farming communities in Bassa and Riyom LGAs, Plateau state,\u201d the statement reads in part.\n\nA 39-year-old farmer is said to have informed Amnesty international that:\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing gunshots in our village since Monday after the attack. We don\u2019t know why we were attacked, I had to relocate to the IDP camp with my family\u201d.\n\nLeaders of some Fulani herders\u2019 community in Plateau state told Amnesty International that the inaction of the security officials contributed to the recent retaliatory attacks in the state.\n\n\u201cThe slow and ineffective response by security officials is contributing to the attacks and reprisal in the state, people are getting away with crimes,\u201d the agency added.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunmen Kidnap APC Zonal Chairman In Niger State\n\nREAD ALSO: Bandits Attack Zamfara Speaker\u2019s Village, Kidnap Father\n\nWhile emphasizing that Nigerians have a right to be protected by the government, the non-governmental body urged the authorities to \u201cact swiftly to prevent such attacks from happening,\u201d adding that \u201cthe slow response from security forces is clearly causing increased casualties\u201d.\n\nAI wondered how much longer the people must be forced to live in fear as such brutal attacks continue.\n\nHerders and farmers\u2019 clashes have lingered for quite a while in Nigeria, especially in the north where the two groups battle over access to resources including water, land and pasture.\n\nThe conflict has become perpetual, and Amnesty International blames this on the failure of the Nigerian government to investigate, arrest and prosecute perpetrators.",

The objective of this initiative is to address our present energy demands and empower the Niger Delta people through promoting local content.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that while there are several modular refineries at different stages of completion across the region, three have been completed including the Niger Delta Petroleum Resources (NDPR) Modular Refinery in Rivers State; OPAC Modular Refinery in Delta State, and Walter Smith Modular Refinery in Imo State.\n\nHe also noted the ongoing remediation exercise in Ogoni land, Rivers State, which was kick-started by the Buhari administration under the recommendations of UNEP.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cIt is important to note that the Ogoni clean-up is the first of its kind in the history of the Niger Delta. Indeed, this is the first time the Federal Government is directly involved in remediation activities within the region.\n\nThe Vice President noted that \u201cbeyond its oil wealth, the Niger Delta region is incredibly blessed with diverse human capital across education, sports, technology, creative arts, entertainment, economy, and many other sectors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the event, \u201cThe Dwindling State of Crude Oil Demand in the Global Market: The Way Forward\u201d, the Vice President stated that factors such as the attendant decline in demand for our crude oil, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global energy demand and on government\u2019s earning, the current situation, require creative and holistic approach to foster economic growth.\n\nNoting that despite the fact that crude oil accounts for about 90 percent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, the VP stated that the Federal Government from inception had shown a commitment towards the creation of economic opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s population in a post-oil future.\n\nThe Vice President highlighted initiatives being taken by the Federal Government to reposition Nigeria\u2019s economy by taking advantage of global trends in the energy sector.\n\nThis includes the SolarPowerNaija Programme under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) which will complement efforts towards providing affordable electricity access to 5 million households, serving about 25 million Nigerians in rural areas and under-served urban communities nationwide.\n\nThe VP also highlighted efforts by the Federal Government on energy transition from crude oil to natural gas, as well as its National Gas Expansion Programme, also a component under the ESP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn line with the Administration\u2019s New Vision for the Niger Delta initiative to develop the region, the Vice President noted that the Federal Government has \u201calso invested significantly in the Niger Delta as the region that holds the energy resources that have powered our progress for six decades as well as the keys to an emergent gas economy.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further noted that the Administration places top priority on peace and security in the region.\n\nCommending the publishers of Gbaramatu Voice Newspapers for organizing the event, the Vice President said the \u2018cumulative effect of all these measures will have a positive transformational impact on the Niger Delta and on the future of our nation as a whole while ensuring sustainable peace and progress in the Niger Delta.",

          "text": "Nigeria ranks 161st on the 2020 Global Youth Development Index, a significant drop from the last ranking which measures the status of young people in 181 countries around the world.\n\nThe West African country dropped 20 places from 141, her last ranking in 2016.\n\nThe report released on Tuesday by the Commonwealth says the index calls for more investment in lifelong digital skilling of young people and youth participation in decision-making to reverse trends which adversely impact them.\n\nAccording to the triennial report, Singapore ranked top for the first time followed by Slovenia, Norway, Malta and Denmark. Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Afghanistan and Niger came last respectively.\n\nConditions of young people around the world also improved by 3.1 per cent between 2010 and 2018 according to the report, but it also noted that progress remains slow.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan, India, Russia, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso were the top five improvers, advancing their score, on average, by 15.74 per cent. On the other hand, Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Jordan and Lebanon showed the greatest decline in youth development between 2010 and 2018,\u201d Snober Abbasi, the Assistant Communication Officer said in the report.\n\nIt further urges governments to improve data collection on education and diversify how they measure digital skills and online engagement of youth.\n\nSpeaking before the release, Commonwealth Secretary-General The Rt Hon Patricia Scotland QC said: \u201cYoung people are indispensable to delivering a future that is more just, inclusive, sustainable and resilient. By measuring their contributions and needs with hard data, our advocacy for their development becomes more powerful, and we are then able incrementally to increase the positive impact and benefits youth are able to add towards building a better future for us all.\n\n\u201cOur Youth Development Index is a vital tool which has already significantly enhanced our capacity to assess the extent to which youth are engaged to contribute beneficially in their societies, and empowered by enabling policies and tools.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhile the data used to compile the index was gathered before the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings indicate where progress was being achieved and where it was not, and that urgent action is now needed so that pre-pandemic gains are not lost but sustained and developed further, more broadly and more inclusively.\n\n\u201cAs we work to recover and rebuild from the many consequences of the pandemic, we need to draw as fully as possible on the energy and idealism of youth so that fresh opportunities for social, economic and political development are opened up with present and future generations of young people equipped and empowered to fulfil their potential.\u201d\n\nIn a pre-recorded message, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Hon Gaston Browne, said: \u201cIt is an important index which offers empirical evidence as to the level of youth development within the Commonwealth. It establishes a baseline so that youth development can be monitored regularly and we can see how we are closing the identified gaps.\u201d\n\nThe index, which draws on multiple data sources, was to be released at the now-postponed Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2020. However, with CHOGM being postponed again until 2022, it was decided to release the index this year.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has issued a call for all eligible civilians to join the armed forces as fighting raged in multiple regions of Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation.\n\nThe call on Tuesday by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning leader represented the further crumbling of the unilateral ceasefire his government declared in June as its military retreated from Tigray or the abandonment of the ceasefire altogether.\n\n\u201cNow is the right time for all capable Ethiopians who are of age to join the Defence Forces, Special Forces and militias and show your patriotism,\u201d Abiy\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nAbiy sent troops into Ethiopia\u2019s northernmost Tigray region last November to topple the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the regional party that dominated national politics for nearly three decades until 2018.\n\nThe move came in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps, said Abiy, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAlthough Abiy promised a swift victory, the war took a stunning turn in June when Tigrayan forces recaptured the regional capital, Mekelle, and the Ethiopian army largely withdrew.\n\nAbiy also declared a unilateral ceasefire, saying it would facilitate aid access to a region where 400,000 people are facing famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations.\n\nSince then, the TPLF has pushed east into neighbouring Afar and south into the Amhara region.\n\nLast week, its forces seized the Amhara town of Lalibela, home to 12th-century rock-hewn churches that are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government\u2019s patience appeared to have run out, with its statement ordering security forces \u201cto halt the destruction of the treasonous and terrorist TPLF organisation and the machinations of foreign hands once and for all\u201d.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, a medical official in Afar told the AFP news agency that 12 people were killed and dozens wounded in a recent attack on displaced civilians.\n\nThe incident occurred on August 5 in Galicoma town, said Dr Abubeker Mahammud, medical director of the Dubti Referral Hospital, where victims were being treated.\n\n\u201cTwelve dead bodies arrived at the hospital,\u201d Abubeker said.\n\n\u201cThe total number of injured victims is more than 46, almost around 50. Almost 75 percent of them had bullet injuries.\u201d\n\nSurvivors told hospital officials they were shot by fighters from the TPLF, Abubeker said.\n\nTwo officials with Afar\u2019s regional government put the death toll in Galicoma at more than 200, but that figure could not be independently verified.\n\nAyish Yasin, head of Afar\u2019s bureau for women and children, told AFP on Tuesday that \u201c200 bodies of civilians have been recovered so far, while more than 48 are still missing.\u201d\n\nAyish, who visited Galicoma on Monday, said many of the victims were killed by artillery fire and buried immediately.\n\n\u201cOut of the 200 bodies recovered, 107 are children \u2013 48 girls and 59 boys,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe victims are civilians who had no role in the conflict.\u201d\n\nThe head of the UN children\u2019s agency, UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said Monday she was \u201cextremely alarmed by the reported killing of over 200 people, including more than 100 children, in attacks on displaced families\u201d in Afar.\n\nUNICEF officials in New York and Addis Ababa said they could not provide more information than what was in Fore\u2019s statement.\n\nEthiopian officials have seized on the deaths in Galicoma as proof of the TPLF\u2019s disregard for the worsening humanitarian situation in Tigray.\n\nBut TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda said on Twitter late on Monday that government troops \u201claunched an offensive on August 5 against our forces in Galicoma\u201d.\n\nHe said the TPLF would \u201cwork with relevant bodies to investigate any incident that may have occurred\u201d.\n\nAid agencies have struggled to get urgently needed humanitarian supplies to cut-off populations in Tigray as the violence has worsened.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR said it had regained access to two Eritrean refugee camps in Tigray for the first time since July 13, warning of the dire conditions facing the 23,000 people living there.\n\nAlthough aid deliveries resumed on August 5, UNHCR spokesman Boris Cheshirkov told reporters in Geneva that access to the Mai Aini and Adi Harush camps continues to be \u201climited by a complex and fluid security situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cBasic services such as healthcare remain unavailable, and clean drinking water is running out,\u201d he added, reiterating a call to ease the passage of humanitarian convoys.\n\nThe TPLF has repeatedly said that it does not have designs on holding territory in Amhara and Afar and is instead focused on facilitating aid access and preventing pro-government forces from regrouping.",
