          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease and Prevention Control (NCDC) has raised alarm over 880 additional coronavirus infections reported in Nigeria from July 2 to 8, though with no fatalities.\n\nThe NCDC disclosed this via its official website on Saturday afternoon, that the country\u2019s commercial capital city, Lagos State, is driving the nation\u2019s latest COVID-19 surge.\n\nLagos state, the epicentre of the virus, accounted for more than 90 per cent of the new infections with 750 cases.\n\nThe data showed that the new cases had raised Nigeria\u2019s infection toll to 258,517, while the fatality toll stood at 3, 144.\n\nThe public health agency stated that about 4,206 people were still down with the virus while a total of 250,388 people were successfully treated and discharged so far in the country since the outbreak in February 2020.\n\nApart from Lagos state, a further breakdown of the latest cases showed that the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) recorded 45 cases, followed by Rivers with 40 infections.\n\nDelta reported 11 cases, followed by Akwa Ibom-11 Kano-five, Nasarawa-four and Plateau one.\n\nThe agency said that three states: Abia, Kaduna, and Sokoto reported no cases within the time frame.\n\nThe NCDC said it was based on the prevailing risk from the virus and the need for religious organisations, community leaders, and Nigerians, in general, to take necessary precautions during the Eid-el-Kabir celebrations.\n\nIt added that the number of weekly COVID-19 cases had increased globally for the third consecutive week.\n\nThe agency said that COVID-19 might cause severe complications in the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions.\n\n\u201cTake extra precautions to stay safe and avoid crowded places.\n\nMaintain distance from anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, wash your hands regularly,\u201d it advised.\n\nThe public health agency said that it was committed to preserving the health of the citizens.\n\n\u201cWe serve even as we battle concurrent public health threats \u2013 COVID-19, monkeypox, Cholera, etc. Our interest is not in delivering bad news but in equipping citizens with the information they need to stay safe.\n\n\u201cWe are being reminded that COVID-19 has not gone anywhere. I understand the fatigue and urge to return to our normal lives. We can do this whilst staying safe.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to celebrate responsibly and act to prevent a fifth COVID-19 wave,\u201d it said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the much-awaited summer lull in coronavirus cases doesn\u2019t appear to be happening as COVID-19 infections continue to increase in much of the United States.\n\nAn earlier rise in cases this year was driven by the BA.2 Omicron subvariant now, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that two other subvariant BA.4 and BA.5, constituted more than 70 per cent of new infections in the country.\n\nThese sub-variants might partially escape the immunity produced by the vaccine and by prior infection, though vaccination still likely protected against severe illness.\n\nMeanwhile, The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), said the good news was that the vaccines and boosters continued to provide excellent protection against severe diseases.\n\nNAN recalls that Nigeria was also experiencing an uptick in transmission, as the positivity rate had increased steadily from July 2 to 8.\n\nThe NCDC did not state which subvariants accounted for the majority of the country\u2019s COVID-19 infections.",

Suleiman Liba who spoke in Damaturu where he celebrated the Eid el Kabir, said that for the party to get it right in the 2023 general election, they must imbibe the spirit of justice, fairness and equity in all its dealings.\n\nHe said that merit should be the watchword for the APC,going forward.\n\nHon. Suleiman Liba who also argued further that it is the turn of the people of the Northeastern part of the country to produce who becomes the next Vice President of Nigeria, said the region has contributed immensely to the politics and policies of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the region is blessed with a lot of eggheads who have contributed tremendously to the success of the party and that of the country.\n\nHon. Suleiman Liba particularly mentioned the name of H. E.

Senator Kassim Shettima, in the spirit of equity and justice was the first to declare support for a southern president in the next election, this act alone has endeared him to many across the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Shettima is a close ally and confidant of the presidential candidate of the APC, so it is believed the both of them can work together in harmony and for the betterment of this country.\u201d\n\nHon. Liba therefore, declared the total support of the group to the candidature of Sen. Shettima for vice president and reiterated that he is planning a one million man match in solidarity for Sen.

If high profile kept at Kuje Prisons could be freed by terrorists, that means that one day, we will just hear that they have entered Aso Rock. This calls for serious concern.\n\n\u201cThough we have to continue to pray, but prayers alone cannot stop insecurity and other forms of attacks, we have to be very visible to and sensitise our people.\n\n\u201cThe situation is getting worse and very recently, Zamfara State governor told his people in the state to acquire arms and ammunition to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cSo, if anybody carries arms in Zamfara State, can he be arrested by the security agents.

          "title": "Untold story of Kuje prison attack \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Molly Kilete, Jude Idu, Abuja\n\nThe first, second and third bomb explosions from the Boko Haram terrorists last Tuesday night may have caught the residents of Kuje Area Council napping.\n\nConsequently, many of them were thrown into panic and confusion. But the successful attack on the Kuje Medium Correctional Centre did not certainly come as a surprise to visitors, workers and close residents of the facility.\n\nFully armed to the teeth, the daredevil Boko Haram insurgents numbering over 300 came fully prepared with bombs, grenades, and all manner of high-calibre ammunition just on a single mission to free their commanders and other members held in the detention facility.\n\nThe seamless manner, the clinical execution and insignificant casualties recorded on their part were confirmations that they took their time to perfect and execute the operations with faultless intelligence.\n\nIt was not an operation carried out in a haste, as available information revealed that they inhabited freely with the residents, and rented houses near the prison facility, for several months or even up to a year.\n\nAs part of their efforts to perfect their planned operation, many of them were said to have disguised themselves, operating as commercial motorcyclists, private security men, traders, and labourers, among other menial jobs, that facilitated their easy blend, especially in the Mosques, markets, and homes with other innocent residents of Kuje.\n\nWhile the plot lasted, they did not leave any trace that could give them away apart from their excessive consumption of Indian hemp, occasional display of aggression and periodic strategic meetings.\n\nHowever, as they carry on their clandestine activities, intelligence reports were either weak, not acted upon or totally ignored. The synergy among the security agencies continued to widen to the point that a security report confirming the attack, on the eve, was deliberately or casually overlooked.\n\nExploiting the weak intelligence, the insurgents had continued to get emboldened by the day, including smoking weeds very close to the back of the prison wall unchallenged and mingling with the security guards during prayers, until the intimidating gang, numbering over 300, successfully carried out the operation with expectedly feeble resistance from the security forces, who may be relatively very new to their duty post.\n\nWith the operation successfully carried out in a show of superior force and celebrated in carnival-like mood with soft drinks littering everywhere, human and material loses of an unimaginable magnitude were incurred.\n\nIn counting the losses, the prison wall had fallen, inmates, numbering over 1,000 escaped, sensitive and non-sensitive documents were either burnt or carted away and more importantly, the insurgent commanders were freed from captivity to worsen and escalate the war against the enemies of the country.\n\nBut, in reality, activities at the Kuje Medium Correctional Centre, to close residents, regular visitors, staff and even the security guards, rightly depict the explosion of the time bomb that has been building up to go off at the planned time.\n\nApparently, security lapses were evidenced in many ways. There was no regular power supply to light up inside and outside the facility.\n\nAccording to a Correctional Service staff, the challenging power situation was so bad that inmates had to resort to the use of rechargeable lanterns for light.\n\n\u201cBeyond overpopulating the prison by majorly awaiting trial inmates without conscious efforts to decongest the population, the absence of any Close-Circuit Cameras to monitor activities within and outside the prison yard was another challenge of serious concern. There was no perimeter fencing to ward off intruders, which aided the attackers to easily seize the centre,\u201d the staff lamented.\n\nThe source added: \u201cFor those that care to know, Kuje Medium Prison is one of the freest facilities in the world. It is so because there has always been an influx of international human rights organisations into the prison. With that development, there is a limit to which the prison authorities can deny the inmates exercise of some fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, that might have accounted for the reason many high profile inmates were allowed the use of phones. Let me shock you that there is one particular Boko Haram commander inside the prison that knows about virtually all the attacks they want to carry out in any part of the country, even as an inmate. He looks so intimidating with the heavy muscles he had continued to build inside the prison.\n\n\u201cThe porosity of the prison accounted for why the authorities rejected the appeal to bring Nnamdi Kanu back to the prison again when he was rearrested. I can tell you that the prison cannot avoid experiencing the horrible incidences it had when Kanu was there before.\n\n\u201cThe inmates were sharply divided along ethnic lines. The atmosphere was always charged because the inmates pledged their loyalties to their ethnic leaders like Kanu and the Boko Haram commanders. I cannot forget in a hurry the day deadly clash was averted inside the prison.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that the loyalists to the Boko Haram leaders were tired of the harassment from those loyal to Kanu that always want to clear the road. Unfortunately for Kanu loyalists, they tried it when the Boko Haram commanders who were outside, but they refused to leave the road.\n\n\u201cThey threatened to burn down the prison and kill Kanu. The warders on duty begged both sides, but none was ready to bulge. Those in-charge were involved and it took more than 30 minutes to restore calm. After the incident, the prison had peace of the graveyard until Kanu finally left. It was that ugly experience that made the authorities resist any plan to bring Kanu back to this centre.\u201d\n\nHow the terrorists struck\n\nLike the divergent views in the description of an elephant, different accounts have trailed the modus operandi the insurgents adopted in attacking the Correctional Centre with the popular account being that they struck through the back gaining confirmation from the authorities.\n\nSome of those whose houses are few metres away from the prison confirmed to our correspondents that the attackers came from the riverside behind the prison; while others claimed they attacked from the front.\n\nHowever, a prison staff, in an official account argued that they deployed a three-pronged attack.\n\nIt was further gathered that the terrorists had gathered, in clusters in surrounding villages, on the eve of the attack to perfect their movement on D-day.\n\nThough the villagers in the communities raised the alarm over the presence of strange persons in their vicinity, to the police and security agencies, not much was done to curtail the movement of these strangers until the attack on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you for sure is that they knew that if they had escaped through the road, they would have been intercepted by the security forces. The truth is that they were more proactive to choose and study an escape route through the bush path. They came through there and left through the same route. It was a bush path they have used severally without sending a negative signal to the villagers on what their real mission was,\u201d the prison officer told Sunday Sun.\n\nPorosity\n\nSecurity sources described the location of the Kuje prison as very porous and prone to attacks by anybody.\n\n\u201cAs a prison where hardened criminals are kept, not much was done to secure the place from attacks. Even the walls are made of blocks instead of casting.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the facility does not have a buffer and a second wall as part of security measures to make it difficult for criminals to gain access. At the back of the prison is a vast expanse of land that is not properly monitored, which made it very easy for the attackers to gain access into the building.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists had planted four explosives at different spots around the prison that went off one after the other. With the blasts that sent a warning signal and scared the security guards, they were able to go in with other dangerous weapons to free their colleagues and escaped without much resistance from the soldiers who had just been rotated a few hours before the attack.\n\n\u201cWhile the attack was going on, the soldiers, about 33, in number could not do much to return fire for fire using their AK47 riffles, while the terrorists came prepared with General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG), and other sophisticated weapons.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers who had barely accustomed themselves with the vicinity of the prison were so confused that they forgot that they had an Armour Personnel Carrier (APC), mounted in front of the prison. However, two of the terrorists were killed by the soldiers who also went after the terrorists in the bush. Their decision to raid the forests in the FCT, yielded positive results as some escapees were rearrested and returned to the facility.\n\n\u201cAlthough security operatives comprising the military, police, DSS, and the paramilitary agencies were drafted to the scene of the attack Tuesday night, a detachment of helicopters from the Nigerian Air Force, began patrolling the airspace Wednesday morning,\u201d a top security source told Sunday Sun.\n\nIn another account, some security personnel always on duty at the Kuje prison for some time now, described the location of the facility as very dangerous and prone to attacks.\n\nHe said that apart from residents encroaching dangerously close to the facility, the Medium Correctional Centre is surrounded by bushes that stretched to Shiroro in Niger State and other dangerous locations housing bandits, terrorists and criminal groups.\n\nThe source, who does not want to be mentioned in print, said that the facility is not fit to detain rapists and pickpockets let alone hardened criminals like terrorists, bandits and their likes.\n\nWhile emphasising that the facility is poorly built, our source said that the government were not proactive in upgrading the facility to accommodate the criminals.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the prison walls that ordinarily should be done with cast and a buffer were not considered by those who built the place knowing full well that it is a prison facility.\n\n\u201cRather than spending money to upgrade the facility to a string and lasting wall for protection from attacks, the contractors under the supervision of government, used blocks like every other house owner to build the walls, which made it very easy for the attack to blow off the fence,\u201d our source explained.\n\nSecurity collaboration conspiracy theory\n\nRegardless of how they carried out the successful operation, the suspicion of the involvement of security agents has understandably persisted.\n\nA prison officer, in attesting to it, confided in our correspondent that despite the Armour Personnel Carrier (APC), and submachine gun at the disposal of the security agents on guard, there was no single attempt to deploy the weapon to use.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists that came for the operation did not touch the APC and the submachine guns, yet they burnt down the official and personal cars beside them. There was no single resistance from the security forces on ground to confront the attackers.\n\n\u201cDespite the numbers of the combined security guards, comprising the army, police, Civil Defence and our own armed squad, none of them was courageous enough to curtail the terrorists. In fact, the Civil Defence personnel who lost his life was the only one who tried to display gallantry, but he paid with his life because he could not understand why the army and mobile policemen withdrew, or listened when his colleague warned him to go into hiding. The response rate from the security guards was not encouraging at all.\n\n\u201cInside the prison was completely empty in the morning hours because virtually all the inmates escaped. From what I gathered, one of the terrorists even broke into the office where sensitive files are kept and either destroyed or burnt them not to trace any record about them. I also gathered that they made attempt to break into Abba Kyari\u2019s cell, but it was difficult for him,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut, the Minister of Defence, Bashir Salihi Magashi, while confirming that the terrorists were on a mission to free their commanders mainly Boko Haram members, said that they succeeded in evacuating 64 Boko Haram members inside the detention camp, but however, dismissed the insinuations and conspiracy theory in the involvement of the security agents.\n\n\u201cThe people that came for this operation, from available records are believed to be from a particular group and most likely they are Boko Haram members. This is because we have a sizable number of Boko Haram members in detention at Kuje prison, but presently we could not locate any of them. The number of Boko Haram inmates is about 64 and none of them is in prison again. They have all escaped,\u201d he revealed.\n\nOn why the army responded too late and equally failed to act on the security report, the Defence Minister said: \u201cIf people give timely intelligence at the right time, I am sure we will react promptly. But when it is not coming on time you don\u2019t expect us to react. There is every likelihood that the situation is going to be interpreted on the basis of being quick or slow in responding to intelligence.\n\n\u201cFrom our discussion, I am sure that every security agent that came to Kuje Prison participated in every way possible to ensure that the prisoners did not escape. There was reinforcement because the Brigade of Guards was fully in charge. Our happiness is that many of them have been recaptured.\u201d\n\nMisuse of purpose\n\nThe 33-year-old detention facility, built and commissioned on August 14, 1989 and rated as one of the best in Northern Nigeria with a potential 560 capacity inmates, was meant to keep pro-democracy activist prisoners from the southern part of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, due to the resurgence in crime and criminalities, the prison had deviated from the initial purpose it was meant to serve, and started accommodating hardened criminals, bandits and terrorists.\n\nReacting to the situation in Kuje Prison, Retired Deputy Controller of Prison, Simon Dung, in a chat with our correspondent, lamented that Kuje prison only recently developed a negative reputation as a detention centre for high profile criminals like Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cMay I remind you that Kuje Prison was actually a facility financed by the military to keep pro-democracy agitators? One of the groups involved in the campaign to end military rule in Nigeria was Campaign for Democracy (CD), which is a pro-democracy coalition of human rights, women\u2019s, workers, and student groups. Pro-democracy activists arrested for whatever reason across Nigeria were sent to Kuje prison.\n\n\u201cAt that time, crimes of terrorism of this dangerous sort have not reared their ugly heads. And one couldn\u2019t think of this kind of jailbreak happening during those days. So, part of the reasons for laxity on the side of the government is that most of those who have ruled Nigeria since 1990s are from the military with little or no preparation for occasions of this kind.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is a security tower, built to be manned by a sentry and possibly private soldier in those days while guiding pro-democracy agitators who were mostly academics and women, different cases from the kind of crimes and criminality experienced today.\n\n\u201cI am also aware that there has not been any major renovation or remodelling of the facility to make it sophisticated to stand the 21st Century security challenges.\n\n\u201cSo, as you can see the reason for setting up Kuje Prison was political and not crime. And what would have been of immense priority was to redesign the prison after it started housing high profile criminals like a proscribed terrorist group, Boko Haram,\u201d he noted.\n\nResidents react\n\nFor every resident of Kuje, the unimaginable escape of the terrorists has thrown them into heightened apprehension and confusion.\n\nIt has worsened the already insecure cases of marauding kidnappers and robbers ravaging the area council.\n\n\u201cTo think that we have mingled with members of the deadly Boko Haram sect in our midst for that long is traumatic enough for every resident of Kuje. Come to think of it that they have known the terrain very well having been involved in Okada operation, which took them close to our house even made our situation more terrifying,\u201d a resident, who declined his name for security reasons, lamented.\n\nAnother respondent, a commercial motorcycle operator, who identified himself as Magaji Wahab from Kebbi State, innocently blamed the attack on security lapses.\n\n\u201cYou see, sometimes the military will claim that they know security well. But, I can tell you that most of these boys came in and infiltrated the community months before the operation. As I do this work, I have seen many things, but my own is to collect my small money to feed my family.\n\n\u201cSo, before it happened many of them were operating Okada and that is why on the day of the attack, scores of terrorists stormed the location with motorcycles and detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and grenades.\n\n\u201cLast Tuesday, was the most fearful night of my life because even though we saw some of those boys when they entered the town and could not inform police or army for fear of using me as an example, it was shocking that the security agencies could not curtail the attack.\u201d\n\nMary Simon Bako, a widow, residing right behind the prison facility told Sunday Sun that she and her family witnessed unusual movements from fierce-looking men sitting close to the bush consuming India hemp endlessly.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw them, we felt something unusual, but it did not occur to us that it was going to be this kind of war-like situation. You see, since seeing boys smoking weed in and around Kuje has now become a daily thing, we felt it was as such,\u201d she narrated.\n\nReacting further, Bako described the sounds from the bomb explosives as deafening, adding that the several gunshots during the attack should be enough to kill all the security men around the facility.\n\nThe widow admitted that all have not been the same for her household since the attack, lamenting that the situation has affected her income because security agents now comb her compound every now and then with strict instruction not to either move about at odd hours or stay out beyond 3:00p.m.\n\n\u201cCan anyone tell me how I can cope with this kind of situation? I feed and pay school fees from this business and we stay late into the night while dealing with customers,\u201d she said.\n\nSani Gorah, another resident of Kuje, in a shocking revelation, narrated how he housed military men that took cover in his residence.\n\n\u201cI slept under my bed; the military men on the road entered my house. They dived under my bed and said they were the target. According to them, they have better guns than that of the military which is AK 47,\u201d he said.\n\nSani further explained that bullets nearly hit his brother, Hassan, who was coming home from town.\n\n\u201cThe operation lasted from around 10:00p.m to 12 midnight with no military presence to stop them. I can tell you this because the shooting continued unabated.\n\n\u201cIt was at that point we understood that those boys we saw previously meant bad. I think I have learnt my lessons about this community. Today, I understand that the prison yard is a security threatening environment,\u201d he quipped.",

Precisely, by 12 noon, Saturday, July 16, the curtain will finally draw on the four-year tenure of Governor Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola, leaving the coveted seat up for grabs.\n\nOn that day, the electorate will file out in their numbers to elect the candidate of their choice who would oversee the affairs of the state for the next four years.\n\nAs contained in the final list released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), 15 political parties have indicated interest to participate in the governorship election.\n\nThese include the Accord Party, AAC, ADP, APC, APM, APP, BP, LP, NNPP, NRM, PDP, PRP, SDP, YPP, and ZLP.\n\nA cursory glance at the figure shows that all contending forces are males with six of them having females as running mates, which is a complete negation of the 30 percent affirmative action on women\u2019s participation in politics.\n\nIn line with the INEC regulations, the field is wide open for all political parties to campaign and persuade the electorate for votes. But not all the candidates are taking full advantage of the window of opportunity provided by the electoral umpire.\n\nOut of the 15 listed contenders, only the standard-bearers of the APC, Governor Oyetola, his rivals in the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, former deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Lasun, the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Akinade Ogunbiyi and Accord Party (AP) respectively are visibly showing signs of seriousness in their campaigns. Others have literally consigned themselves to the back seat.\n\nWatching from the sideline, many political pundits see the contest as a straight fight between the APC and PDP.\n\nThis is particularly bearing in mind the crowd being pulled by the two parties in their electioneering as well as their dominance in all the local government areas of the state.\n\nAs Sunday Sun observed, the presence of other political parties has not been so much felt in most parts of the state compared to APC and PDP.\n\nFor the APC, in spite of the obvious advantage of the power of incumbency, Governor Oyetola has been unrelenting in his vigorous campaign for re-election for his second term.\n\nIn the same way, Ademola Adeleke has left no stone unturned in his effort to wrest power from the APC-led government. In one of his campaign tours of the state, he was quoted as saying that the election would be fire-for-fire, which perhaps explains the reason he took the battle to Boripe Local Government, the governor\u2019s country home, with a massive crowd of his supporters.\n\nNonetheless, the political atmosphere in the state has been very peaceful. However, one thing most political analysts have found to be an aberration to the Yoruba culture of respect for traditional rulers is the open partisanship of some Obas. While it is customary for candidates to pay homage to town monarchs before going on an open campaign tour, some notable Obas in the state have misconstrued the gesture to mean an opportunity to showcase their bias or favour for the visiting contenders.\n\nFor instance, Adeleke recently got a shock of his life when his campaign train stormed the palace of the Owa-Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, only for him to be told pointedly that Ijesaland was for the APC.\n\nAn overzealous Adeleke had lamentably poured out his mind about the poor living condition of the people, as well as the deplorable state of the roads within the Senatorial district. \u201cIlesa as a senatorial district ought not to be like this. I want to assure you that when I win come July 16, it will change. When we were coming to the palace and the people thronged out to meet us, we noted that the suffering is too much. The roads in Ilesa are also bad even the road that leads to the palace is in a bad condition. We will do the needful,\u201d he enthusiastically declared.\n\nBut instead of a reciprocal commendation for his show of concern, Oba Aromolaran pointedly turned down the overture, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need money from anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said the other time that the people of Ijesa are suffering, we are hungry truly, but God will continue to feed us. In Ijesa, we are independent of the government; we built the palace ourselves without collecting a dime from outsiders. The current governor wanted to give us money, but we did not collect. The only thing we demanded from the governor was to help us inaugurate it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any money from anybody. We built a hospital for the aged. The appeal I want to make is that when you become the governor, don\u2019t forget us. I am grateful for you visiting us, we are very fine.\u201d\n\nWhile Adeleke and his supporters have had to take the unintended brickbats with a pinch of salt, the outburst of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, who also recently declared that PDP made him the crowned king, has no less elicited negative comments from certain quarters. Some concerned stakeholders in APC see the declaration as an open endorsement of Adeleke as his preferred candidate.\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Akanbi, in his usual eccentricity, took the trend a notch higher by organising a special prayer for Governor Oyetola, pledging to deliver 90,000 votes for the APC in the July 16 poll.\n\nThis is aside from a recent meeting of some traditional rulers held at the palace of Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Agbaje, where the monarchs in attendance unanimously endorsed the candidature of Governor Oyetola, directing the Muslims, Christians, traditionalists, artisans, motorcycle and Okada transporters, students, applicants, civil and public servants, men, and women organizations to support and vote for Oyetola in the coming governorship election.\n\nWith the growing show of partisanship, there is a widespread insinuation that the whole charade must have been masterminded by the Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oyetola\u2019s hometown Oba, who many observers have accused of rallying his colleagues to support his son and also persuading other sons and daughters of the town to vote massively for APC.\n\nOther than the negative consequences the worrisome trend of open politicking by some Obas might likely have on the institution of traditional rulers, electioneering in the state has been quite peaceful and orderly without any incident contrary to the earlier apprehension about the possible outbreak of violence among the supporters of the two leading parties.\n\nAs the campaign is gradually winding to a halt, opinion is divided as to which of the two leading parties-APC and PDP is likely to coast home to victory. On a balance of scale, it might be safe to say that it is too close to call. But some factors are possibly going to work in favour of the APC.\n\nOne, APC as a ruling party has a strong structure across all the local governments in the state. In a circumstance like this, it is much easier for the party to mobilise grassroots support because of patronage of office.\n\nSecondly, the apparent show of solidarity by the Southwest governors elected on the platform of the APC as well as the recent victory of the party in the recent Ekiti State election could be a morale booster for both the electorate and the supporters of Oyetola at large. There is also a high possibility of a bandwagon effect on the voting pattern.\n\nAs already demonstrated by the APC campaign council, both the local and national are united in their efforts to lead the party to victory.\n\nWhile the electioneering lasted, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano states were very much on hand, leading Oyetola to every nook and cranny of the local governments to woo the electorate for votes.\n\nAgain, with the newfound relationship between Governor Oyetola and his predecessor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the coast now appears to be clearer for the party.\n\nAregbesola, who heads the splinter group, \u2018The Osun Progressives (TOP), was said to have reportedly warned his members not to work against the APC. That is already a big plus for Oyetola.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun, the Chairman of Ede North Local Government of the TOP, Oladejo Afeez, who recently joined Oyetola\u2019s faction, said that his decision was informed by the directive given to them by the Minister of Interior who directed them to work for APC. Afeez, while confirming a change of disposition, said: \u201cYes it is true that I have left TOP together with my people in Ede North Local Government. Aregbesola said we should not work against APC and we should not decamp to another party. I will rather stop being in politics than decamp to PDP.\n\n\u201cAll the party executives, including the women leader have followed me to join Oyetola.\n\n\u201cSince our leader has told us not to work against the party, we should stay in the party and work for the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIn the face of all this, no one who has been watching the campaign train of the PDP will undermine the formidable force of Adeleke. With his impressive performance in the last election, he still enjoys a considerable following across the state.\n\nHowever, his main challenge is the internal wrangling within the PDP, as the disaffection arising from the governorship primary still remains largely unsettled. Almost all the founding fathers and chieftains of the party have vowed not to have anything to do with Adeleke.\n\nAdeleke caught the anger of the party stalwarts when his supporters allegedly attacked former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who was suspected of working for the emergence of Dotun Babayemi as the party\u2019s standard-bearer, warning him to steer clear of the governorship contest.\n\nSince then, Prince Oyinlola, former deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Shuaib Oyedokun, a former member of the Board of Trustees of (BOT), Senator Olu Alabi, and some other party chieftains have distanced themselves from Adeleke and his campaign activities.\n\nAlso, another co-contestant in the 2018 governorship election, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, has left the PDP to pick the governorship ticket of the Accord Party (AP).\n\nPolitical observers have described the gale of defections that recently hit the PDP in the state as a big minus for Adeleke. Those who defected to APC include the running mate of Senator Adeleke in the 2018 governorship election, Albert Adeogun, and the factional chairman of PDP, Hon Wale Ojo, among others.\n\nIt is not exactly clear where a factional governorship candidate of the PDP, Dotun Babayemi, currently stands in the present scenario.\n\nWhile, on one hand, he has been calling for support for the PDP, on the other hand, he has been found to be conspicuously missing in Adeleke\u2019s campaign rallies.\n\nWhen contacted, the Director of Media, Omooba Dotun Babayemi Campaign Organisation, Kayode Oladeji, said \u201cHe (Babayemi) is campaigning for the party because it is the logo of the party that is written on the ballot and not the name of the party candidate.\u201d\n\nThough APC has equally recorded some harvest of losses in recent times, including a former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kolapo Alimi, political watchers say the figure could not be compared with the defectors to the APC.\n\nThis, they say, calls for concern for the PDP and its candidate. While nursing the wounds, the Senator representing Osun East, Senator Francis Fadahunsi, who has been a strong member of PDP in the state, is equally said to be having a face-off with the Adeleke family over an alleged plot to deny him the return ticket in the just concluded primary. It is on account of this, Sunday Sun gathered, that Fadahunsi has dissociated himself from Adeleke and consequently refused to partake in all the campaign activities of the PDP.\n\nThese are bound to have some negative impacts on the success chance of the PDP in the coming election except there is a quick resolution of the lingering crises ahead of Saturday\u2019s poll.\n\nRegardless of the changing dynamics of the power game, optimism is high that the INEC would conduct a free, fair, and credible election devoid of violence as recently experienced in the Ekiti State governorship election held last month.",

          "text": "It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Gaa-Lamba, a community in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State.\n\nSalamatu Ayinde, a 26-year-old nursing mother, stood in front of her house with a worried look on her face.\n\nBorehole at Gaa-Lamba Village\n\nClad in a brown-striped wrapper that barely covered her chest, the nursing mother had her gaze fixed on the ground and one hand on her collarbone.\n\nMs Ayinde was lost in thought when SaharaReporters approached her to inquire about the Zonal Intervention Project (ZIP)-facilitated borehole in her community.\n\nShe looked up with a jolt, sighed and began to complain bitterly.\n\n\u201cThat borehole has never been useful to us. It stopped working a few moments after its inauguration in January 2021,\u201d she said, leading SaharaReporters to the borehole at the back of her house. \u201cSince then, water has been a big challenge.\u201d\n\nMs Ayinde's major concern that afternoon was where to get water to perform her house chores as a housewife.\n\nFor her water needs, the nursing mother had relied on a neighbour who had a borehole in her community.\n\n\u201cEvery morning we usually take our bucket to a neighbour's compound to fetch,\u201d Ms Ayinde said, gloomily. \u201cBut for the last few days, they have refused to pump water because they said people always disturb their sleep while fetching in the morning.\"\n\nMs Ayinde is not the only one disturbed about the water situation in the community. A woman in the community who identified herself as Iya-Ibeji is also troubled.\n\n\u201cIn Gaa-Lamba, to get common water is a big problem for us,\" said the short fair woman. \u201cWe have complained to our community leader so many times, but they have done nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"When this borehole was brought, we thought we had finally won the battle of trekking long distances to get a bucket of water. But our joy was short-lived when the borehole could not serve us beyond a few days.\n\nGaa-Lamba is one of the communities that benefited from the Zonal Intervention Borehole Water Project facilitated by an honourable member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi. But, the finding shows that even though the new borehole was installed, it could not serve the people beyond a few after it was opened.\n\nThe Water Situation In Kwara\n\nPoor access to clean and potable water for use in many households across Nigeria has contributed majorly to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and several others.\n\nAccording to data from Water and Sanitary Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH NORM) in 2019, only 14 per cent of the country\u2019s population have access to safely managed drinking water supply facilities.\n\nThe survey also shows that access for people in rural communities is four times less than the population of urban areas. This is due to such supply points being more than 30 minutes away from their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent report by UNICEF and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the north-central region ranks lowest of all geopolitical zones in the number of people using basic water supply, sanitation services.\n\nOut of the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT), Kwara ranks 36th, just a step above Ebonyi which sits at the bottom of the table.\n\nUNICEF reports that when sources of water are not within immediate premises, women and children pay the price of water collection.\n\nThe N100M Water Projects\n\nTo bring potable water closer to the people of his constituency, In 2020, a member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi, nominated projects for the provision of motorized boreholes at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward and at Afon, in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State at the sum of N25 million each (N50 Million in total).\n\nThe projects, which were part of the 2020 Appropriation Act, were aimed at resolving water scarcity across six villages. These villages are Gaa-Lamba, Labintan Alakuko, Giwa-Olowo, Ile Baale Afon, Sakama, and Gaa-Igboroko. It was placed under the supervision of the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA).\n\nA document released by the supervising agency which was obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that the budgeted sum (N100,000,000.00) was totally cash-backed on the projects.\n\nOn-site fact-finding\n\nTo monitor the projects, SaharaReporters embarked on site verification of these borehole projects supervised by the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA) at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward.\n\nVisits to the locations of these projects revealed that although new boreholes were installed at these villages, except for the one built at Giwa Olowo village that was found still serving the community, the other two installed at Labintan Alakuko and 0Gaa-Lamba could not solve the problem of water scarcity in these communities.\n\nThe borehole built at Gaa-Lamba was not functioning during SaharaReporters\u2019 investigation, while that of Labitan Alakuko was functioning but could not serve the population that depended on it.\n\n\"The borehole is working but the problem is that it is not pumping water well,\" said Ismaila Alao, a resident of Labitan Alakuko Village.\n\n\"To fetch a 25-litre jerry-can, you would need to wait for at least an hour and this is why many residents do not even bother about the borehole.\n\n\"As you can see, it has been a while since we went there because no one is ready to contribute money to buy petrol and at the end, the borehole will not pump well,\" he added.\n\nLike many disadvantaged communities in Kwara, where the presence of government was not felt in any way, people of Labitan Alakuko village have many years relied on wells and a stream for their survival and the women in the communities have to struggle daily with walking long distances to the stream to fetch water for drinking, cooking and doing chores.\n\nWhen the borehole had just been drilled, it was a dream come true as women, children and men joyfully thought going to streams to get water would be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to the streams to fetch water because the borehole is not enough for us,\" said a woman who was too angered to give her name.\n\nAFON\n\nWhen SaharaReporters visited the locations for the second phase of the projects in Afon, it was discovered that boreholes were installed at Ile Baale Afon, Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko villages.\n\nWhile the people of Ile-Baale Afon were still benefiting from the water project installed in front of their community, residents of Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko complained of lack of water as the boreholes installed were not functioning. They were still forced to trek long distances to neighbouring villages in search of potable water.\n\nBalikisu, a mother of five who is a resident of Sakama village said, \"We fetch water from wells or streams. And Sometimes, we pay pushcart users money to get water for us to drink and do our house chores.\n\n\"All this would have stopped if the borehole installed for us was working well,\" Balikisu added.\n\n\n\nLNRBDA Spends 50 Million Naira On Ote-Ballah Dam But No Value Derives\n\nAnother water project nominated in 2020 by Abdulyekeen Alajagusi for the people of his constituency was the rehabilitation of the Ote-Ballah Dam. N50 million was allocated in the 2020 Federal Government budget for the rehabilitation of this dam in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara.\n\nAccording to the information received from Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA), the total sum of N50M was released to rehabilitate the dam which has been abandoned since 2003 and awarded to Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited.\n\nA visit to the dam by SaharaReporters showed that despite the public funds committed to the project, residents of the communities are yet to derive value for the money as they still scramble for water to meet their daily needs.\n\n\"It has been over ten years we fetched tap water here,\" said Kamaru Yusuf, a resident of Alalubosa Area, Ote, in the Asa local government area.\n\nAnother resident of Ote who identified herself as Amope said for the past seven years since she was married into the community, she had never fetched water from the tap.\n\n\"We only get water from hand-pupping boreholes and wells,\" Amope said.\n\nContractor Speaks\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Fatai Aberi, the Managing Director of Fab Confidential Limited told SaharaReporters\u2019 correspondent that they had completed the project and got a 'satisfied' acknowledgement after the needed assessment from LNRBDA, the supervisory agency.\n\nHe said despite the N25 million contract sum released for the project, he also used part of his personal funds to see that the project was complete\n\nBut when told about the situation of some of the boreholes that stopped supplying water shortly after inauguration, he said, \"For now, I can't promise anything but we will try and see what we can do.\"\n\nNo Comment on Ote-Ballah Dam\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, all efforts to get the reaction of the lawmaker regarding his failure to rehabilitate dam projects he had facilitated for members of his constituency were not successful. He did not answer several calls from SaharaReporters and did not reply to text and Whatsapp messages sent to his mobile line.\n\nAlso, Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited, the company that handled the project, did not return several calls, text messages, and Whatsapp messages sent to them, asking for their comment on the dam project.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today on Everyday People, we meet Rita Anwiri Chindah, an intellectual property and information technology lawyer and an arbitrator based in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State. A random decision at the university led her down a path that would eventually turn her into an educationist. Now she hosts the IPSERIES podcast, a mini blog series on Twitter, and publishes a Substack newsletter to educate people on how much intellectual property is a part of all we do.\n\nI published my first [IPSERIES] episode on May 18, 2020. I think I had about 65 plays in how many days, but the feedback I kept getting from people was that I was sniffing and truthfully I was sniffing because I have allergies.\n\nI started getting comments from people on how to record. Someone suggested I should record in a quiet place. So sometimes when I want to record, I have to tell my family, cause I stay with my parents.\n\nI tell them, \u201cI\u2019m recording today. Please, can you guys, you know, tone down the noise,\u201d and they do that.\n\nThen someone else suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a mic?\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to get a mic?\u201d I tried to get one from Jumia, and when they did not deliver after one month, they said I should go to the nearest post office.\n\nI went there the first time and they said, \u201cOkay, maybe come back next week.\u201d\n\nAnd I went back the following week.\n\nThey said, \u201cAh, Madam, we never receive anything [we haven\u2019t received anything].\u201d\n\nI was like, \u201cAh!\u201d\n\nSo I think I sent an email or I called. And they said if I couldn\u2019t wait, I should cancel the order.\n\nI was like, \u201cAfter waiting this long, are you people joking?\u201d I had had enough. Like, seriously, why are we not moving forward? Why do we always look for ways to frustrate people?\n\nThen this year, I think I saw someone on Instagram selling a mic, and I was like, \u201cOkay, let me try her,\u201d and I bought it, and it was excellent.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nRita Anwiri speaking at a South South Media event. Source: Instagram\n\nI did my LLB at Madonna University, Okija, and in 400 level, they introduced three elective courses: oil and gas, banking and finance, and intellectual property (IP). And I was like, \u201cWhat is intellectual property?\u201d\n\nI just decided to do the random one I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nIP education for me started when I was at Infusion Lawyers. Senator Ihenyen, my boss at the time, and I had this conversation about IP awareness and educating people. And then, the firm came up with a Frequently Asked Question blog called IP ABC.\n\nThat was where the interest started to build up. Then I started dropping IP bits on Twitter and tagged it IPSERIES. I\u2019m not sure if that was the first major case I analysed. It wasn\u2019t much of a case, but I saw someone post something that I felt was untrue because Deola Sage put up a notification saying her Komole design had been registered as a design under the Nigerian Design Act.\n\nSomeone said she didn\u2019t have the right to do that, \u201cHow can you protect aso oke [traditional Yoruba fabric]?\u201d\n\nI thought about it and concluded it was not ordinary aso oke. So I sat down and compared the original Yoruba aso oke and Deola Sage\u2019s Komole [Kandids].\n\nI went on Instagram and I stumbled on this post and it makes me very excited because creatives such as Deola has taken a bold step in the fashion industry to protect her designs.\n\nNow the not clearly states that any infringement of any sort would be prosecuted \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/qdshVQz92w \u2014 ANWIRI (@esmeraldo99) October 23, 2019\n\nI did that tweet, and people received it well, so I started building on that.\n\nThen during the pandemic, LolA With The Duffle Bag on Twitter shared a link to her podcast and said that she uses Anchor to do her recording.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for my new podcast where I\u2019d be sharing and answering your questions. Watch, listen and enjoy!\n\n\n\nFirst episode drops May 4, links would be available then. Get ready to subscribe on Spotify, Apple podcast, google podcast and other platforms.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udca1 and \ud83d\udcbc pic.twitter.com/covcNVmnrh \u2014 LolA With The Duffle Bag\u2026 (@L3galtool) April 27, 2020\n\nSo I checked it out, and when I realised it was very easy to record and share, I decided to try doing a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast, I began considering a newsletter. Telema Davis, one of my friends who always pushes me to do more, told me to do it if I wanted to. Expectedly, he edited my first newsletter publication.\n\nI didn\u2019t know which platform to publish on, and he suggested Substack? So I got my Substack account. So far, I have 66 or 67 podcast episodes, 12 newsletters, and over one hundred mini blog series on Twitter.\n\nSomeone who has listened to all my podcasts suggested I put my microphone in a pillowcase and, you know, talk into it, and the background sound would be muffled.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done all those things just to make sure that I put out good quality content.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not easy staying consistent; it\u2019s a bit overwhelming because each content must have a different storyline. So it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just copying, pasting, and resharing.\n\nContent is key, and everything is content. When you\u2019re just starting, you don\u2019t get likes or retweets, and at such times, you wonder if you\u2019re making sense. But once you keep at it, people get to know and interact with you.\n\nWalking through the process\n\nRita Anwiri (third from the left) speaking at a panel at the Africa NXT 2022 event\n\nFirst up for me is usually the research, where I have to study the case and look out for things people didn\u2019t notice while reading or talking about the case because I\u2019m giving a Nigerian/African perspective. So I also have to read and compare many documents and conversations.\n\nThe next step is structure. How do you want the story to flow? Are you going to tell a very witty story? I write and then type because I\u2019m used to capturing my thought processes on paper first. As I type, I figure out what is relevant and what to discard.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done with research and typing for the Twitter series, I start posting. Sometimes I try to throw in pictures to help people better understand the conversation.\n\nWhen that is done, I share the link on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSometimes, depending on how complex it is, I decide to have a guest on my podcast. I remember we had this Tracy Chapman and Nicki Minaj case when I started, and I was wondering how to discuss it. So I reached out to Mark Jaffe, a colleague and friend who is more into copyrights. Interestingly, this connection was not physical, and that is the beauty of the Intenet \u2014 it is easy to connect with people.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that foreigners always want to help, so I was not surprised when he asked what I needed. We had a very interesting conversation and he said he was willing to come back and talk about something else if I needed him to.\n\nDealing with Internet connection issues\n\nRita was selected as a Trailblazer by the World Intellectual Property Review (WIPR) magazine in 2020\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, especially with network issues; I once went in and out of a session with a guest ten times.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope the last episode recorded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d I replied\n\nWhen I was listening to the recording, I did not hear anything that I said, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThere was this time when it was a football matter and I wanted to interview two guests, but only one of them could log in. After many attempts, we cancelled and did not try to record afterwards; I felt bad because I was really looking forward to that conversation, which was going to shed light from the eSports sector to the regular sports sector\n\nSo while the Internet is good, the technical issues are not fun. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing sometimes because you\u2019re all hyped up. You have your router or your MiFi on standby. You have your mobile data, just in case. And before you know it, something unexpected happens. I sometimes ask myself why I am in Nigeria.\n\nI was so upset once that I tagged Anchor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this to me, today of all days? I can\u2019t even log in. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies, maybe check your Internet,\u201d they responded.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cOh gosh, the Internet again!\u201d\n\nThe thing is you are trying to task yourself mentally while doing many things simultaneously, but people have no idea what goes into producing content. When you\u2019re Googling and reading different documents, make sure give a brief summary of everything because that is really where the work is.\n\nAnd the thing is, you are trying to tax yourself mentally while doing all of this and people don\u2019t see behind it. When you\u2019re trying to Google, trying to read different documents, make sure that you give a brief summary of everything. That\u2019s where the work is.",

          "title": "Young filmmakers struggle to get content on major streaming platforms",
          "text": "As Nollywood continues to grow, young filmmakers are struggling to come to the limelight with their movies or have them distributed on major platforms due to various requirements that do not align with the big streaming services.\n\nThese requirements include digital technology, better storylines, and use of popular actors among others. For an upcoming film producer, these requirements can be a tall order due to the cost implications.\n\nPrecious Asuai, director and editor of the movie \u2018Something special\u2019 shared with BusinessDay the challenges he faced as a young filmmaker in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we faced with making \u2018Something Special\u2019 was funding and distribution. For funding, it is hard to get investors especially when it\u2019s your first film. Because we really wanted to make a feature film without giving in to financial difficulties and procrastination, we had to consider funding the film ourselves.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of the funding was from personal savings while the remaining 20 percent was from friends and family. We learned that this is the only feasible way to fund your film as a beginner,\u201d Asuai said.\n\n\u2018Something Special\u2019 according to Asuai has benefited from the digital revolution. Without the possibilities that digital platforms offer, the crew would not have been able to get the film across to the audience it has currently.\n\nBut the affordability of digital equipment remains a big challenge for young filmmakers. Asuai said there was no option, it was either using digital technology or nothing.\n\nRead also: Nollywood battles internet pirates as streaming booms\n\n\u201cWe knew before making \u2018Something Special\u2019, that distribution had to be considered if we wanted to make money, but getting the film made was more important. If we thought more about distribution first, we would have stalled because that would require more funds and we probably wouldn\u2019t have made the film. Many of the distribution decisions from the outdoor screening at Terra Culture to host the film at Fruitful Studios were made after production,\u201d Asuai said.\n\nAlso, collaborations with a web developer saved Asuai and his crew more cost to have their film on a platform like Fruitful Studios where people can pay to watch Something Special. This option was chosen as a result of the difficulties faced with getting the movie on major platforms.\n\nPeace Oni, another filmmaker told BusinessDay that the biggest challenge has been getting funds. The majority of her films have been crowdfunded by friends and family. Even after the film is finished, she still needs to know someone who can help her get it on major streaming services.\n\nExperts say the major requirement for top streaming platforms is casting. If the cast is unknown in the region to influence the marketing of the firm, it is difficult for the top streaming platform to distribute.\n\nRead also: Streaming vs cinemas: How Nollywood can thrive\n\nAsuai noted that this is understandable because the focus is often on making money however the talents are not readily available. Filmmakers who don\u2019t have enough money to cast those popular actors stand no chance and actors who aren\u2019t popular also don\u2019t stand a chance, no matter talented and hard-working they are. Asuai said he is a firm believer that talent and not popularity should come first.\n\nStreaming services have in recent times, provided the platform for telling unique stories , and audiences across different stratification are taking notice. These have also been rewarded with higher investment in content. Netflix, Amazon, and Showmax have all increased their budgets for local content in Africa.\n\n\u201cStreaming platforms onboarding any kind of content on their platform is based on some quality and the standards they set for any content they put on whether it is a feature film, documentary, or reality show, everything is based on quality, and there is a lot of quality demand,\u201d said Obinna Okerekeocha, creative director at REDTV.\n\nHe further noted that due to their zealousness and eagerness to show the world what they are made of, there is no shortage of creativity among young filmmakers. Some of them go the extra mile by teaching themselves, while others would go to art or film schools to learn the necessary skills, as well as online sites like Udemy to learn what it takes to make a film.\n\n\u201cThere are many aspects to not only making your film, but also having high standards in terms of what camera is used for shooting, the quality of your audio post-production, or the quality of your video post-production, as well as having the translation text and subtitle text in place,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that audio must adhere to certain standards, whether it is Dolby Atmos, 5.1, or 2.1 surround sound. All of this is significant because the technology used to deliver this content is quite advanced. This will result in the streamers preferring to work with people who have prior experience.\n\nThe uniqueness including video and audio quality, storyline, quality of cast, production, design, and directing, will require young filmmakers to work with production houses, and people who previously had successful content either in distribution, production, or metrical release.\n\n\u201cFilm is a product, and a product must have a certain level of quality. It has to be a good product so that when it is out there, they know it\u2019s a good product and it\u2019s all-encompassing because the film is an amalgamation of various things and if one thing is bad, it affects the rest of your design.\n\n\u201cIf the film looks good in 4k video, it has good HDR, good colors, and a great color palette but there is a problem with the sound, people will not like the film likewise if the sound is great, but the images are not, there is also a problem,\u201d Okerekeocha said.\n\nWhile young filmmakers may struggle to try and get their work accepted by big streamers because quality is very important, there is a need to work with good production designers and actors who will also help filmmakers to get their films on big streaming platforms.\n\nOkerekeocha added that consistency is key, young filmmakers should use the opportunity to improve their craft across the board and make sure they are excellent in what they are doing. They create products that are for the mass market and people should be able to appreciate that product because if one part of it is bad, it affects everything else.\n\nMany young creatives are unaware of the entire process of getting their content commissioned or licensed. They don\u2019t know who to approach, how to approach them, or what fees these platforms will offer. The platforms themselves haven\u2019t done a particularly good job of making the entire process transparent and seamless, said Eric Kafui, Media enterprise in Africa\u2019s Filmtech.\n\n\u201cSecondly, although many young filmmakers are super talented and have what it takes to create meaningful and exciting content, they are often challenged with accessing funding to create content that streaming platforms would want,\u201d he added.",

On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

          "text": "Abubakar Bukola Saraki, former Senate President Bukola, has described the visit by governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, as a miscalculation.\n\nRecall that three APC governors, including Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, as well as Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti State, visited Wike\u2019s residence in Port Harcourt, the state capital, for a closed-door meeting on Friday.\n\nThe visit came amid speculations that Wike, who is a member of the PDP, might defect from the party after losing the presidential and vice-presidential tickets.\n\nBut speaking with reporters during the Eid celebration in Ilorin, Kwara state capital, Saraki said Wike is important to the PDP and the party won\u2019t let him go.\n\n\u201cWike is an important member of our party and I am very confident that in no distant time, we will sit down and address all the issues. There is no doubt about it that he has cause to feel the way he does, but there are better ways by which issue like this can be resolved,\u201d Saraki said.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that we are all talking to one another. We are on top of the situation and PDP will reunite and forge ahead to win the next elections. I assure you that PDP will definitely resolve its family issue that it currently has.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some APC governors went to see their colleague, trying to capitalise on what they think is an issue is a gross miscalculation. At the end of the day, their visit is going no where.\n\n\u201cThe APC governors know that it is this kind of a crack they need to latch on. Fortunately, we are not going to give him to them because the election ahead is too important. The destinies of millions of Nigerians are too important and even bigger than any party or individual. I appreciate that, all our stakeholders appreciate that and Governor Wike himself appreciates that.\u201d\n\nSaraki said the APC government should lock itself up in a room and refuse to come out over its failures in governance.",

The affair lasted until I got married to her in 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite being a married woman, Kalu continued his illicit affair with her, booking and inviting her to hotels to sleep with her.

Bashir Sheriff Machina was duly announced as winner of the APC Yobe North ticket while DIG Udom Ekpoudom (rtd) was duly announced as the Akwa Ibom North-West (Ikot Ekpene) senatorial district ticket on the platform of APC.\n\nIn a statement signed an issued on Saturday in Abuja by the INEC national commissioner and chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, titled, \u2018Clarification on Issues Relating to Candidate Nomination and Release of Certified True Copies of Documents\u2019, said the allegations of underhand dealings against INEC regarding the two senatorial tickets were intended to impugn the integrity of the Commission\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cThe attention of the Commission has been drawn to speculations circulating online on the outcome of some of the recent primaries conducted by political parties and related issues.\n\n\u201cIn particular, allegations intended to impugn the integrity of the Commission have been made in respect of the Akwa Ibom North West and Yobe North Senatorial Districts.\n\n\u201cTo set the record straight, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandates the Commission to monitor the organisation and operation of political parties, including their finances, conventions, congresses and party primaries. In line with its constitutional and legal obligations, the Commission deployed monitors to the various constituencies and received reports of such exercise.\n\n\u201cIn relation to the primaries for the Akwa Ibom North West and Yobe North Senatorial Districts, the Commission stands by the monitoring reports received from our State offices.\u201d\n\nFor these reasons, Okoye said the Commission did not publish the personal particulars of any candidate for the two senatorial districts at variance with the reports, which emanated from the States.\n\n\u201cRight now, the Commission is funtus officio in the two cases. Aggrieved parties are at liberty to approach the Federal High Court and seek redress as provided in section 285 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and sections 29(5) and 84(14) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\u201d\n\nOn the issuance of Certified True Copies (CTCs) of documents, he said the staff of the Commission has been working hard, including weekends, to meet the deluge of requests received.\n\nAs at Friday, July 8, 2022, he said the Commission has processed 433 requests involving the certification of 1,662,776 pages of documents.\n\nHe said many of them were awaiting collection at the INEC headquarters by some of the same applicants complaining of delay in issuance of the CTCs.\n\n\u201cSection 29 (4) of the Electoral Act provides that any person may apply to the Commission for a copy of nomination form, affidavit, and any other document submitted by a candidate at an election and the Commission shall, upon payment of a prescribed fee, issue such person with a certified copy of document within 14 days. Persons applying for CTC of documents should endeavor to act timely and within the ambit of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will continue to uphold the integrity of the electoral process, including the deepening of the deployment of technology to enhance the credibility of elections,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has finally clarified its stance regarding the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary elections in Yobe North and Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial districts for the 2023 elections, saying the Commission will only stand by the reports of its monitors sent to monitor the exercises.\nThe nation\u2019s electoral body also said the Commission is currently funtus officio in the two cases.\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the immediate-past Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, are reported to be angling to replace the initial winners of the Yobe North and Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial tickets respectively.\n\u201cIn particular, allegations intended to impugn the integrity of the Commission have been made in respect of the Akwa Ibom North West and Yobe North Senatorial Districts.\nIn line with its constitutional and legal obligations, the Commission deployed monitors to the various constituencies and received reports of such exercise.",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced his resignation, hours after a crowd of angry protesters chased him from his residence and set the prime minister\u2019s home on fire, as months of frustration brought on by an unprecedented economic crisis boiled over.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people massed in the capital Colombo to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation\u2019s finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages.\n\nstorming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound\u2019s pool.\n\nOthers were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence, with one pulling out what he claimed was a pair of Rajapaksa\u2019s underwear.\n\nAt around the same time, the leader had boarded a naval craft at the Colombo port and was taken to the island\u2019s southern waters, where he let it be known he was finally bowing to months of calls for his resignation.\n\n\u2018To ensure a peaceful transition, the president said he will step down on July 13,\u2019 parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana said in a televised statement.\n\nRajapaksa had to be extracted from his residence by troops who fired into the air to keep the crowd outside at bay.\n\nSoon after they stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa\u2019s nearby seafront office also fell into the hands of protesters.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the first person in line to succeed Rajapaksa, called a meeting with political leaders and said he was willing to step down to pave the way for a unity government.\n\nBut that failed to placate protesters, who stormed the premier\u2019s private residence and set it alight after night fell.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a crowd cheering the blaze, which broke out shortly after a security detachment guarding Wickremesinghe attacked several journalists outside the home.\n\nNo casualties have been reported in the fire so far, and police said Wickremesinghe and his family were away at the time.\n\nSecurity forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo\u2019s administrative district earlier in the day, with dozens injured in the resulting clashes.\n\nA spokeswoman for Colombo\u2019s main hospital said three people were being treated for gunshot wounds, along with 36 others suffering breathing difficulties after being caught up in tear gas barrages.\n\nSome protesters, holding Sri Lankan flags and helmets, also swam in the presidential swimming pool, video footage from local TV news NewsFirst channel showed.\n\nTwo defence ministry sources said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was removed from the official premises on Friday for his safety ahead of the planned rally over the weekend, with government spokesman Mohan Samaranayake unsure of Rajapaksa\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nThe island of 22 million people is struggling under a severe foreign exchange shortage that has limited essential imports of fuel, food and medicine, plunging it into the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948.\n\nMany blame the country\u2019s decline on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as it muddles through with aid from India and other countries and its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe president\u2019s older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base, while three other Rajapaksa relatives had quit their Cabinet posts earlier.\n\nMuch of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption and nepotism.\n\nA new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, took over in May to help steer the country out of the crisis. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa has held on to power despite largely peaceful protests since March demanding his resignation.\n\nThousands of people swarmed into Colombo\u2019s government district, shouting slogans against the president and dismantling several police barricades to reach Rajapaksa\u2019s house, a witness said.\n\nThere were even reports that angry protesters from out of town had forced railway staff to run trains to take them to Colombo.\n\nThousands of people broke through barricades and entered President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence and nearby office to vent their anger against a leader they hold responsible for the nation\u2019s worst crisis.\n\nFootage showed people in a jubilant mood taking a dip in the garden pool of the residence. Some lay on beds, others made tea and drank, and made \u2018statements\u2019 from the conference room that Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe must immediately quit.\n\nWickremesinghe said he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, but didn\u2019t say anything about Rajapaksa\u2019s whereabouts. Opposition parties in Parliament were currently discussing the formation of a new government.\n\nRajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister in May in the hope that the career politician would use his diplomacy and contacts to resuscitate a collapsed economy. But people\u2019s patience wore thin as shortages of fuel, medicine and cooking gas only increased and oil reserves ran dry.\n\nMany protesters accuse Wickremesinghe of trying to save Rajapaksa when he came under pressure to resign and every other member of his powerful political dynasty quit the Cabinet.\n\nLater Saturday evening, protesters moved near Wickremesinghe\u2019s home in a bid to force him to quit immediately.\n\nPrivately-owned Sirasa Television reported that at least six of their staff members including four reporters were hospitalized after they were beaten by police while covering the protest near Wickremesinghe\u2019s home.\n\nSri Lanka Medical Council, the country\u2019s top professional body, warned that the country\u2019s hospitals were running with minimum resources and will not be able to handle any mass casualties from the unrest.\n\nDemonstrators have been camped outside the entrance to his office for the past three months.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters storming the residence, chanting \u2018Gota go home,\u2019 calling the president by his nickname. Dozens were seen jumping into the pool, milling about the house and and watching television. Outside the building, barricades were overturned and a black flag was hoisted on a pole.\n\nAt the president\u2019s office, security personnel tried to stop demonstrators who pushed through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building.\n\nPolice fired shots in the air but were unable to stop the angry crowd from surrounding the presidential residence and pushing through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building.\n\nAt least 34 people including two police officers were wounded in scuffles as protesters tried to enter the residence. Two of the injured are in critical condition while others sustained minor injuries, said an official at the Colombo National Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nSri Lanka Medical Council said that the president, prime minister and the government would be held responsible if people died or were maimed. It urged the leaders to heed the cry of the people, resign and hand over the reins to an all-party government.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

This was made known in a statement made available to the media yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, REA Mr. Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad explained that the framework underpinned by the MoU between both parties, is expected to be implemented in a sustainable and impactful manner, while also addressing one of the Agency\u2019s strategic objectives \u2013 to promote electricity consumption for \u201cproductive use\u201d in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe MoU will mutually benefit both the REA and FADAMA. Both parties are keen to unlock the economic potential in agrarian communities, through the provision of electricity solutions for agro-processing and irrigation schemes\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe MoU will ensure timely communication and cooperation during the implementation stage of the programme, including support (where applicable) in conducting field surveys, monitoring/supervision and impact assessments.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Technical Services, REA Barka Sajou said that subsequently the agro-energy programme, as well as other proposed programmes under the framework, will be implemented to demonstrate opportunities for the private sector.\n\nAnd based on the lessons learned, viable agriculture-energy solutions and business models can be adopted and scaled commercially.\n\nThe MoU is also expected to consider the Agency\u2019s recently-launched Energizing Agricultural Programme EAP.\n\nThe EAP is a three-year initiative with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet GEAPP, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation that aims to stimulate the use of mini-grid electricity in agricultural productive uses.\n\nThese \u201cAgro-Energy\u201d programmes are intended to provide electricity for productive use and unlock the economic potential/activities in rural and agrarian communities alike.\n\nSo far, the Agency has communicated and cooperated with stakeholders during the pre-implementation stage, including support in conducting desktop and field surveys to identify viable sites.\n\nMore specifically, and in line with REA\u2019s proposed agro-energy programmes, the NFDP\u2019s component 2 (Small Scale Community Owned Infrastructure) aims to rehabilitate surface water and construct new small-scale irrigation schemes and borehole schemes, as well as other groundwater irrigation schemes and infrastructure support.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

It is this power of engagement and sincerity that resulted to the release of this 7 victims\u201d.\n\nWhile he thanks the General Officer Commanding the one Mechanized Division of the Nigerian Army for the support during the negotiation and the subsequent release of the hostages, Mamu however lamented that despite the poor medical condition of many of the released hostages, there was unnecessary security checks which wasted \u201ctheir time in a military unit at the outskirts of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThe location they (abductors) gave is remote, sensitive and risky. There was a military checkpoint before penetrating the forest. My team was stopped by the soldiers but when they told the military our mission they contacted the GOC and he immediately gave approval for them to proceed.

          "text": "Nigerian Muslims have joined their counterparts across the globe to celebrate the 2023 Eid-El-Adha also known as Eid-El Kabir.\n\nThe annual festival of Eid al-Adha or the Festival of Sacrifice marks the end of the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca by hundreds of millions of Muslims.\n\nIt is usually celebrated with prayers offered on the Eid ground, followed by the slaughter of goats, sheep and cattle in commemoration of the Prophet Abraham\u2019s readiness to sacrifice his son to show obedience to Allah.\n\nIn Katsina, President Muhammadu Buhari arrived his country home, the Daura area of the north-western state for the Eid-el- Kabir on Friday evening.\n\nREAD ALSO: Sallah: I Won\u2019t Rest Until I Bring Relief To Nigerians \u2013 Buhari\n\nHe had earlier arrived at the Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua International Airport, Katsina, from where he was flown to the ancient town in a helicopter.\n\nHundreds of residents from within and outside the town attended the two Rak\u2019at prayers, including the President and his son, Yusuf and the Emir of Daura, HRH Umar Faruk Umar as well as other top-ranking personalities.\n\nThe two Rak\u2019at prayers led by Imam Safiyanu Yusuf Dansanwai at Kofar Arewa Eid Prayer Ground commenced at about 10:00 am and rounded up at about 10:05 am.\n\nAlso in attendance were traditional and religious leaders including the ward, village and district heads as well as members of the business and political communities in Daura.\n\nPresident Buhari eventually slaughtered his ram meant for sacrifice.\n\nIn Muslim parlance, the festival is the most important feast in the Muslim calendar because it is an occasion to celebrate the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Isma\u2019il, in submission to Allah\u2019s command.\n\nIn commemoration of this intervention, an animal, usually, a ram, is sacrificed ritually and divided into three parts.\n\nOne share is given to the poor and needy, another is kept for home and the third portion is given to relatives.\n\nAs usual, after performing the two Rak\u2019at Eid-El Kabir prayers and the ritual sacrifice, people come out mostly in northern states to watch the historic Durbar otherwise called Hawan Sallah, the durbar of which has been cancelled by both Katsina and Daura Emirates.\n\nEarlier before the commencement of the prayer, security was beefed up at the Kofar Arewa Eid prayer ground in Daura.\n\nSecurity personnel from the Police, the Army, the DSS, the NSCDC and other sister security agencies stormed the Eid Prayer Ground to give maximum security for the President, his entourage and other worshippers attending the Eid Prayer.\n\nChannels Television observed that the entire parameter fencing of the Eid Prayer Ground was completely surrounded by a team of security personnel deployed by their various agencies with movements of vehicles including bicycles restricted in the area.",

That is why I keep emphasising that government has the power to end the agony of this innocent victims in one day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no military solution to the current security debacle in Nigeria. When you sincerely engage them (terrorists), even though wicked with misguided religious beliefs, they are listening.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mamu, no ransom was paid in securing the release of the abductees.\n\nMamu who is publisher of the Desert Herald, said the 7 rescued victims have been handed over to the military and are now on their way to Kaduna. He thanked the Kaduna military GOC for the support he gave during the rescue mission.\n\n\u201cThe location they (terrorists) gave is remote, sensitive and risky. There was a military checkpoint before penetrating the forest. My team was stopped by the soldiers but when they told the military our mission they contacted the GCO and he immediately gave approval for them to proceed.\n\n\u201cAnd after the victims were successfully evacuated, travelling through over 40 kilometers in the forest, they were given a military escort back to Kaduna at the checkpoint.\u201d\n\nMamu pleaded with the families of the remaining victims to engage government to secure the release of their loved ones, hinting that he will not be involved in negotiations again.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked a Kaduna-bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63 others. Many others were wounded.\n\nOne of the abducted victims was released few days after a ransom of N100 million was paid. A pregnant woman was also released, before the 11 set free four weeks ago.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to resign after party leaders in Parliament demanded both he and the embattled president step down on the day protesters stormed the president\u2019s residence and office.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman, Dinouk Colambage, said Wickremesinghe told party leaders that he will resign when all parties have agreed on forming a new government.\n\nHis decision came after the biggest protest yet swept Sri Lanka on Saturday as tens of thousands of people broke through barricades and entered President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence and nearby office to vent their fury against a leader they hold responsible for the nation\u2019s worst economic crisis.\n\nSri Lankan protesters stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence and nearby office on Saturday as tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo in the biggest demonstration yet to vent their fury against a leader they hold responsible for the island nation\u2019s worst economic crisis.\n\nIt was not clear if Rajapaksa was inside his residence but footage showed hundreds of people inside the well-fortified house and on the grounds outside, some taking a dip in the garden pool and others in a jubilant mood.\n\nA government spokesman, Mohan Samaranayake, said he had no information about Rajapaksa\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nLeaders of political parties in Parliament met after the storming of the president\u2019s residence and decided to request Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down, opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said on Twitter.\n\nHe said a consensus was reached that the parliamentary speaker should take over as temporary president and work to form an interim government, he said.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economy is in a state of collapse, muddling through with aid from India and other countries as its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities.\n\nThe turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades.\n\nThe president\u2019s older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base, while three other Rajapaksa relatives had quit their Cabinet posts earlier. Much of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption.\n\nA new prime minister, Wickremesinghe, took over in May to help steer the country out of the crisis. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa has held on to power despite growing calls for him to quit.\n\nOn Saturday, as droves of people broke through barriers to occupy the president\u2019s residence, hundreds of protesters, some carrying national flags, also stormed his seaside office in another nearby building. Demonstrators have camped outside the entrance to his office for the past three months.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters storming the residence, chanting \u201cGota go home,\u201d calling the president by his nickname. Dozens were seen jumping into the pool, milling about the house and and watching television. Outside the building, barricades were overturned and a black flag was hoisted on a pole.\n\nAt the president\u2019s office, security personnel tried to stop demonstrators who pushed through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building.\n\nAt least 34 people including two police officers were wounded in scuffles as protesters tried to enter the residence. Two of the injured are in critical condition while others sustained minor injuries, said an official at the Colombo National Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThousands of protesters entered the capital from the suburbs earlier on Saturday after police lifted an overnight curfew. With fuel supplies scarce, many crowded onto buses and trains to come to the city to protest, while others made their way on bicycles and on foot.\n\nProtest and religious leaders called on Rajapaksa to step down, saying he has lost the people\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cHis claim that he was voted in by the Sinhala Buddhists is not valid now,\u201d said Ven. Omalpe Sobitha, a prominent Buddhist leader. He urged Parliament to convene immediately to select an interim president but said that Wickremesinghe did not enjoy the people\u2019s support.\n\nProtest leaders in their proclamation demanded the resignation of not only the president and the government but all government officials and the country\u2019s ambassadors. They said that the protesters should have access to governance as a pressure group.\n\nLast month, Wickremesinghe said the country\u2019s economy has collapsed. He said that the negotiations with the IMF have been complex because Sri Lanka was now a bankrupt state.\n\nIn April, Sri Lanka announced it is suspending repaying foreign loans due to a foreign currency shortage. Its total foreign debt amounts to $51 billion of which it must repay $28 billion by the end of 2027.\n\nPolice had imposed a curfew in Colombo and several other main urban areas on Friday night but withdrew it Saturday morning amid objections by lawyers and opposition politicians who called it illegal.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung on Friday asked people to protest peacefully and called for the military and police \u201cto grant peaceful protesters the space and security to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cChaos & force will not fix the economy or bring the political stability that Sri Lankans need right now,\u201d Chung said in a tweet.\n\nAP",

          "text": "Naomi Campbell is now Dr. Campbell after receiving an honorary Ph.D. for her contributions to the fashion industry.\n\nNaomi Campbell just added an honorary Ph.D. from the University for the Creative Arts in England to her list of groundbreaking life achievements.\n\nThe degree is the perfect fit for Campbell\u2019s ongoing legacy in the fashion world. The supermodel attended the commencement ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Thursday, wearing a beige jumpsuit and black boots beneath her cap and gown.\n\nThe 52-year-old supermodel gave fans a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the day\u2019s festivities on Instagram. While brief, in the video Campbell shows off her cover-girl smile as she simply says, \u201cHi everyone!\u201d while strutting in her cap and gown.\n\nA tweet from Perfect Magazine also revealed the recent graduate wiping tears of joy from her eyes as she spoke to the audience, Campbell recalled attending fashion house Balenciaga\u2019s couture presentation in Paris just a day before, walking the runway alongside Nicole Kidman, Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa and more while rocking a voluminous floor-length black coat.\n\nFrom runway strut to graduation walk, there is no understating the significance of Campbell\u2019s accomplishments. The icon\u2019s contributions have been deeply felt in the fashion industry and beyond, as she\u2019s used her influence to not only further her own still-strong career, but support the ambitions of others, especially fellow Black models.\n\nThe trail Campbell has blazed in the fashion world began at age 15, when she quickly became one of the most sought-after modelsin an industry notorious for keeping Black women out. Despite becoming one of the most globally famous Black models, she nevertheless received a disproportionate amount of advertising compared to her white counterparts.\n\nDrawing from her own experiences and adversities, Campbell was also vocal during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. During an interview with Reuters that year, she expressed hope that \u201cchange\u201d was, at last, coming as brands made promises to better recognize and value Black lives. This included hiring more Black talent \u201cas designers, stylists and make-up artists,\u201d as well as in editorial and executive roles.\n\nAs an influential voice in couture fashion and now also a mother of a one-year-old daughter, Campbell continues to speak openly and earnestly in 2022 about the ways in which fashion needs to evolve and pave the way for new talent.",
