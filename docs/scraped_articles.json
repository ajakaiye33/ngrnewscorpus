          "text": "By Emmanuel Uzodinma and Eunice Udeh\n\nAmidst worsening insecurity in Nigeria, the Archbishop of Enugu Ecclesiastical Province and Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, His Grace, Most Rev. Emmanuel Chukwuma has warned that a revolution is coming to chase away those holding the country down.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the Archbishop made the call during his pre-Synod press conference on Tuesday.\n\nHe also asked President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to quit if it cannot find solutions to the security problems facing the country.\n\nWhile noting that the church is very much concerned about the state of the nation, Chukwuma said, \u201cNigerians should prepare for a revolution, enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the security situation in Nigeria; kidnappings and killings have become the order of the day.\n\n\u201cNigerians, for the past 23 years, have endured enough insult, abject poverty and suffering. They have so much been taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Buhari has not done enough to protect the people. I say this because the number of people killed under the Buhari Government is more than any other country.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of government is security, but Nigeria has become a safe haven for criminals, insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, killers; they are all on rampage.\n\n\u201cThe church is not happy, the church is angry, the church is crying for a revolution, for a new Nigeria. These old cargoes should give the youths a chance, they have expired.\n\n\u201cI have said it that Buhari should resign if he can\u2019t find a way to resolve these killings, the leadership of this country should resign.\u201d\n\nHe also accused the security agencies of a double standard in finding solutions to the security challenges.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhat happened in the Kaduna Airport, as well as the train attack should make the Government know that these terrorists have crossed the red line\n\n\u201cBut my question is how can we have battalions of soldiers but they cannot stop this terrorism, there is deceit in the military? What stops them from going into the forests, all they are doing is seminar?\n\n\u201cNigerian Christians have tolerated for so long, enough is enough. All Christians should rise. The Owo incident is an eye-opener, it is not enough for the Government to sympathize.\n\n\u201cIf they could fish out Nnamdi Kanu, why is it difficult to get these people killing our people in all the cities? The security agencies are not sincere.\u201d\n\nHe, however, charged the youths to rise and take back the country with their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards, PVCs.\n\n\u201cThere is now clamour to vote out expired leaders; that\u2019s why there is a surge in the number of people seeking PVC.\n\n\u201cThe young Nigerians should get their PVCs and vote out these old cargoes. Vote out banditry, vote out corruption, vote out all manners of ills in governance. The youths should rise up, they will decide the 2023 election and any attempt to rig the election will lead to revolution,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe expressed concern over the growing rate of abduction and killing of Christians in different parts of the country, urging the Christians to find a way and defend themselves.\n\nHe said there was clearly an Islamization agenda but that the Christians would continue to resist it.\n\nArchbishop Chukwuma also stated that the case involving the Accountant General of the Federation was a serious dent on President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption stance.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about N80b. This is the climax of it under the Buhari Government. We need to know what has happened to the N80b and he should be prosecuted and jailed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t spare both the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, accusing them of allowing injustice to thrive by not conceding their presidential tickets to the South-East.\n\nHe disclosed that the theme of the synod is: \u201cFeeding the Sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a hungry world and the church has a role to play. We are to feed the sheep and not feed on the sheep. This will be emphasised during the synod,\u201d he stated.",

Permit me to use this opportunity to appeal to President Buhari to please reconsider and put this move on hold in the interest of the nation. Ajaokuta Steel is too vital and interesting to be concessioned to strangers. When true patriots come into power come 2023, it should be handed over to a team of Nigerian and African engineers and the Nigerians society of engineers to run.\u201d\n\nNdu, who doubles as the director, Institute for African Renaissance Studies and Realisation at the Gregory University Uturu, noted that the most fundamental and foundational task of any realistic administration come 2023 should be to transform Nigeria to a country devoid of primordial, ethnic, tribal and religious tendencies and loyalties.\n\nHe stressed the need to integrate Nigerians living in Diaspora fully into the governance gamut and in all arms of government.\n\nNdu said: \u201cFor too long we have denied our Diaspora community of their natural and inalienable rights and privileges.

Just make sure that the price is on your pump.\n\n\u201cKindly contact the Secretariat should you have any authority challenging your operations.\u201d\n\nThe chaos in the stations that dispensed fuel with a fewer number of pumps was worsened by jerry can-carrying residents in search of the product to power their generators.\n\nIn Lagos, the queues were most noticeable at filling stations owned by major marketers in traffic-prone areas like Oshodi, Ejigbo, Ikeja, Egbeda, Ikotun Igando, Iyanaiba and Satellite.\n\nNearly all stations operated by independent dealers in the commercial city did not open to motorists.\n\nMotorists in Osun, Kwara, Rivers, Delta, Edo, Kano, Katsina, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Benue, Nasarawa, Borno, Yobe, Imo, Abia and Gombe had no challenges purchasing fuel from both major and independent dealers, but petrol still sold between N165 and N180 per litre.\n\nA source in the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) attributed the scarcity to a dislocation in the supply chain.\n\nThe MOWAN source, who pleaded anonymity, explained that when there is a disruption of the supply chain, it \u201ctakes an average of almost two weeks to get it back to normal.\u201d\n\nHe added that NNPC Limited restored supply late yesterday, adding that motorists and commuters may have to cope till the early part of next week when normalcy is expected to return.\u201d\n\nBut IPMAN National Operations Controller, Mike Osatuyi, pointed out that the fuel being sold in the last one week by independent marketers was a part of the reserves they had.\n\nHe said: \u201cMarketers have been loading from the stock they had and we are running low on the product because we haven\u2019t received fresh supply. The situation will be worse if nothing is done urgently and when the old reserve we have runs out.\u201d\n\nBut IPMAN Chairman, Lagos Satellite Depot, Ejigbo, Akin Akinrinade, had before the statement announcing the increment, blamed the shutdown of stations operated by independent marketers.\n\nHe, however, explained to reporters in Lagos that IPMAN members resolved to shut down their operations because they could no longer operate at a loss and in a hostile environment.\n\nHe said the government fixed pump price at N165 per litre even when current realities showed that the minimum price should be N180.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you can see, the queues are back and this is the second time we are witnessing it this year.\n\n\u201cHowever, this one is peculiar in the sense that for a particular reason, IPMAN members decided to shut their stations.\n\n\u201cThis is not because we are on strike, but because we can no longer do business under this condition.\u201d\n\nAkinrinade added that IPMAN members ought to be getting supply from the Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), having made payments of over N1 billion since October 2021.\n\nHe said the products were yet to be delivered forcing members to patronise private depots and at the same time servicing borrowed funds.\n\nAkinrinade added that their plight was worsened by private depot owners who \u201cincreased the ex-depot price of PMS from N148.17 to N162 per litre.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you factor in the handling charge, transportation and running cost of our stations, you will see that even within Lagos, the minimum we can retail petrol is about N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cWe want Nigerians to know that we are not out to sabotage the effort of the government because we know this hike in petroleum products prices is not peculiar to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has disrupted the supply chain and we know that the Nigerian government is doing its best to mitigate its impact on our nation.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to direct the private depots to revert to the old ex-depot price for PMS or deregulate the downstream sector to allow market forces to determine the price.\n\nThe IPMAN boss further called for the resumption of pumping of products through the PPMC Ejigbo depot, saying it would enable IPMAN members to get supply at a cheaper cost.\n\nThe situation in Abuja remained the same yesterday as private depots were under lock and key due to a lack of supplies.\n\nOnly the overcrowded NNPC mega stations were seen by our reporters selling fuel to motorists\n\nIPMAN National Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi said: \u201cMost of the private depots in Abuja and other places have no product. This is apart from the cost of the diesel, which is the main cause.\n\n\u201cIf care is not taken, this scarcity will bring serious hardship to the public.\u201d\n\nIn Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, long queues also resurfaced in the few stations that opened, leaving motorists and commuters lamenting.\n\nMany stations in the city were shut as they claimed not to have fuel to dispense.\n\nThe queues were seen at Rano filling station along Ado-Iworoko Road in the city and at BOVAS located at Bank Road along new Ado-Iyin Road.\n\nIn Ikere-Ekiti, the second largest town in Ekiti, filling stations were also shut down and a few that opened had long queues of vehicles.\n\nVehicle owners, tricycle operators and motorcyclists in Jos, the Plateau State capital also lamented as they bought fuel at N190 and N200 at the few independent stations that opened for business.\n\nOur reporter, who went to some of the f stations within the city, reported that the majority of the dealers barricaded their gates.\n\nAt the NNPC mega station along Secretariat junction, motorists lamented that they had been able to purchase fuel there in the past four days.\n\nNNPC spokesman, Garba Deen Muhammad, again could not be reached for comments as his mobile number was \u201cswitched off\u201d.\n\nThis is a common situation with Muhammad, who has always been evasive in responding to media inquiries about petrol scarcity.",

          "text": "\u2022Says consultation with Buhari, others ongoing\n\n\u2022Place holder a Nigerian invention with no foothold in law, INEC clears\n\n\u2022Insists presidential candidates already submitted names of running mates\n\n\u2022Commission holds concert to mobilise voters for registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, last night, cleared the air about the status of his choice running mate, a former National Welfare Secretary of the APC, Kabiru Ibrahim Masari, whom he insisted was duly nominated, but could choose to step down within stipulated time, and would not have breached any known laws, rules or regulations.\n\nTinubu, who maintained that Masari remained his choice as running mate and also denied sending his name in as a place holder, however, said consultations with President Muhammadu Buhari and other stakeholders of the ruling APC were still ongoing.\n\nThis is as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, fired warning shots at politicians, saying their new invention \u2013 the use of place holder \u2013 to sidestep its deadline was not only unknown to law, but alien to democratic practice.\n\nIt warned that there were no forms or space in its forms for Place Holders, stating categorically that as far as it was concerned, the parties fielding candidates for next year\u2019s presidential election, have submitted the names of their running mates as at the July 17 deadline as contained in the schedule of activities by the commission.\n\nResponding to comments by INEC\u2019s National Commissioner of Information and Chairman, Voter Education, Festus Okoye, while on ARISE TV, Tinubu\u2019s Media Aide, Tunde Rahman, maintained that Masari was his principal\u2019s choice of vice-presidential candidate for 2023 general election and the situation remained so, despite ongoing consultations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithout taking issues with the INEC National Commissioner, I just like to state the situation as it relates to the presidential candidate of the APC, As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\n\u201cAnd it is that As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu has duly completed his nomination forms, including giving the particulars of his running mate. He has returned the completed nomination forms to INEC. He even returned the forms two days ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about a placeholder. This is the coinage of the media. I know he has picked a running mate.\u201d\n\nHe, however, reiterated that consultations were still ongoing between President Muhammadu Buhari, Tinubu, his running mate, Masari and the APC national leadership.\n\nConversely, Rahman hinted that, if Masari, on his own volition, decides to step down as vice presidential candidate within the stipulated time frame given by INEC, no provisions of the constitution and the electoral laws could be viewed to have been observed in the breach.\n\nHe said, \u201cI must add, however, that there are ongoing consultations involving President Buhari, the party\u2019s governors and the APC leadership with As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu and his running mate. If following these consultations, the running mate decides, for instance, that he wants to stand down in the interest of the party and the country, I think it\u2019s only fair and appropriate to allow him deal with that as long as it is done within the spheres of the electoral law and the timeframe for that, given by INEC.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s within the prerogative of the running mate to take his own decision and to say, for instance, that he would like to stand down because he feels doing so will serve the candidate and the party better than he remaining on the ticket. And that this is done in line with the provision of the law and INEC guidelines and timetable. This is the way it is.\u201d\n\nINEC had yesterday said the idea of \u2018Place Holder\u2019 was a Nigerian invention, which had no place in the constitution or any legal foothold, adding also that there was no provision for such option in the forms submitted by the parties.\n\nThis nonetheless, INEC has commenced a five-day musical concert from yesterday, June 20 to Saturday, June 25, with the sole objective of enhancing and mobilising more registration of voters in the ongoing exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the ARISE Television Morning Show, Okoye, hinted at how political parties could substitute its vice-presidential candidates, a process not as easy as it was originally made it seem by the parties.\n\nSome of the presidential candidates had submitted to INEC, what they referred to as space or place holders.\n\nDeadline for all the 18 political parties to submit the names of their presidential candidates and running mates had elapsed on June 17 2022.\n\nThus, with the use of place holder, it presupposes that such vice-presidential candidates would be substituted later as they were only put in to beat the deadline provided by the Electoral Act.\n\nBut, while the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, beat the deadline and submitted the name of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate, the likes of Labour Party (LP) and the APC are yet to pick their running mates.\n\nIn a desperate bid to beat deadline, therefore, Tinubu, submitted the name of Masari, while Peter Obi gave INEC the name of his Campaign Director-General, Doyin Okupe.\n\nOkoye, who stated the running mates could only be substituted by writing to the commission, and attaching a sworn affidavit, said, \u201cThe law says that as a presidential candidate, you must nominate an associate to run with you and as far as the Independent National Electoral Commission is concerned, the presidential candidates have submitted their associates to run with them in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, there\u2019s no form submitted by the presidential candidates, where they said, \u2018we\u2019re submitting this person\u2019s name as a place or space holder\u2019. The issue of space or place holder is a unique Nigerian invention, that has no place in our constitutional and legal framework.\n\n\u201cPolitically, parties\u2019 candidates have submitted names of associates to run with them and that is the position of the law as at today and nothing has changed. For there to be a substitution of candidate, the vice-presidential candidate must write to INEC, with a sworn affidavit, stating that he is withdrawing from the race within the time frame provided by the law. That\u2019s the only way there can be a substitution of candidates.\u201d\n\nOkoye also told THISDAY that though the commission was not aware of any court order on extension for registration, INEC would do everything within the law to mobilise more voter registration within the period under the view, adding that the musical mobilisation was to enhance more Nigerians to register between June 25 and June 25 .\n\n\u201cThe commission will, towards the end of June, meet to review the voter registration exercise and determine the way forward. As the INEC chairman said during the musical concert in Lagos, the Abuja musical concert is aimed at mobilising all prospective Nigerians, who have come of age to go and register.\u201d\n\nThe musical mobilisation concert, Okoye, added, was expected to last five working days.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) yesterday faulted the Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC) for the recent scarcity of premium motor spirit (PMS) in the country.\n\nThe Chairman, IPMAN, Lagos Satellite Depot, Mr. Akin Akinrinade, at a media briefing in Lagos, stated that since December 2021, not a litre of PMS had been lifted at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC) Satellite depots at Ejigbo, leaving independent marketers to the hands of private depots who he said have increased their ex- depot price to a level no longer sustainable to sell PMS at N165.\n\n\u201cOur members are registered to load with PPMC, but since December last year, not a litre has been lifted at the NNPC\u2019s Satellite depots in Ejigbo. We have tickets that have been paid for amounting to over a billion naira as far back as October last year and as we speak, these tickets have not been loaded meaning that PPMC is holding on to our money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThese are funds we are supposed to use to run our businesses. We are businessmen, we take bank loans and now we are paying for money that we are not using.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the prevailing scarcity of petrol was due to its members\u2019 inability to replenish their stock based on the current price of loading PMS from private depots.\n\nHe recommended that based on current economic realities, the sustainable price to sell PMS should be pegged at N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you today, no private depot is selling below N162 per litre ex depot. We still need to add cost of transportation which is between N6 to N8 depending on the distance within Lagos and if it is outside Lagos, it is more than that and if you add the transportation cost to N162, it is already N170 and do not forget that this product is regulated by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe have not even added other charges at the depots and the running cost of our stations. Our members can no longer sell at N165 and in fact, there is no reasonable businessman that can sell below N180 per litre,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAccording to him, most of its members have shut down their stations not because they are on strike, but because the operating environment was no longer sustainable to do business under the current price of PMS.\n\nHe pointed out that the immediate challenge to its members was the inability to load from NNPC depots, saying the only option was to depend on private depots along Apapa, Abule Ado and the Lekki Free Trade zones who he said have increased their ex- depot price to a level no longer sustainable for its members to sell at N165 per litre.\n\nHe, however, stated that Nigeria was not immune to the effect of the Russian-Ukraine war, saying that Nigeria\u2019s dependence on foreign import of PMS is impacting negatively on the economy.\n\n\u201cThe war has jacked up the price everywhere across the globe, so it is not as if our members are trying to sabotage the federal government it is just that we can no longer sustain the price they are giving us. So unless the government intervenes by bringing the products to our depots for us to buy at N148.17 as against the N162. How do we breakeven? We want Nigerians to know that we are patriotic and corporate Nigerians and we want the government to do what needs to be done to address this challenge,\u201d he averred.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Vows to resist $418m London/Paris Club Consultancy Fee\n\nWale Igbintade\n\n\n\nThe Body of Attorneys-General of 36 States of the Federation (BOAG) has condemned what it called constant and destabilising threats by federal government agencies to the states, asserting that state governments are equal and not subservient to the federal government\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) had in a public notice warned that most states and local governments have failed to remit to the Service Withholding Tax (WHT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) deductions from payments made by them to contractors and service providers as required by law.\n\nHowever, the Body of Attorneys-General in a communique issued at the end of it\u2019s meeting in Lagos, a copy of which was obtained yesterday, frowned at the FIRS threat to recover unremitted tax deductions by states and local governments.\n\nAlso, the conference vowed to send a written response to the FIRS, highlighting the agency\u2019s erroneous position and that it lacks the power to impose any penalty on the states.\n\nThe communique was jointly signed by BOAG\u2019s Chairman and Secretary, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Dr. Abdulkarim Kana.\n\nRegarding the federal government\u2019s attempt to deduct States\u2019 funds to offset a purported consultancy fee of $418 million arising from the London/Paris Club Loan refunds, the conference resolved to continue to resist, through all legal means, the wrongful deductions of their funds under any guise.\n\nThe BOAG maintained that the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Central Bank of Nigeria, and other relevant agencies should cease all further action on the matter pending the final resolution of an appeal filed on behalf of the States.\n\nOn the ongoing court action concerning the right of states to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and the subsisting judgment to that effect, the conference resolved that given its absence from the 1999 Constitution, VAT remains a residual matter that falls within the exclusive legislative competence of each federating state.\n\nWhile the conference maintained that, the judgment of the Rivers Division of the Federal High Court supports the constitutional position that VAT is a residual matter, it added that it was not opposed to a political resolution of the dispute to balance fiscal federalism with equity.\n\nThe communique read: \u201cRegarding the FIRS\u2019 threat to recover unremitted tax deductions by states and local governments, the conference stresses that state governments are equal and not subservient to the federal government.\n\n\u201cBOAG condemns the constant and destabilising threats by federal government agencies to the federating states. To that end, BOAG will send a written response to the FIRS, highlighting the agency\u2019s erroneous position and that it lacks the power to impose any penalty on the states.\n\n\u201cRegarding current developments in the Administration of Justice across the 36 States/Inter-State Collaboration and the activities of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, BOAG encouraged the States to continue to share experiences on critical matters and areas of commonality in the administration of justice.\n\n\u201cBOAG encouraged all states on the use of technology in court proceedings. It also commended inter-state collaboration in facilitating virtual hearings for police officers and witnesses outside the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of stamp duties, BOAG resolved to send its position paper opposing the proposed amendments to the Chairmen of the appropriate Senate and House of Representatives committees in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cBOAG will write to the Senate President and Speaker of the House stating its opposition to proposed amendments to the Stamp Duties Act.\n\nBOAG will publicly announce its opposition to the federal government\u2019s proposed amendments to the Stamp Duties Act.\n\n\u201cBOAG will sensitise the governors of the various states concerning the detrimental effects of the federal government\u2019s proposed amendments to the Stamp Duties Act.

          "text": "Ibrahim Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), has reacted to a letter sent to him by justices of the supreme court.\n\nIn the letter seen by TheCable, 14 justices of the apex court accused the CJN of abandoning his responsibilities as the leader of the court.\n\nSome of the issues raised by the justices include \u2014 accommodation, vehicles, electricity tariff, supply of diesel, internet services to justices\u2019 residences, training for justices and epileptic electricity supply to the court.\n\nHowever, the CJN in a statement issued by his spokesman, Isa Ahuraka, said he did not want to join issue with the justices, adding that the circulation of the letter is akin to \u201cdancing naked at the market square\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJudges in all climes are to be seen and not heard, and that informed why the CJN refrained from joining issues until a letter, said to be personal, is spreading across the length and breadth of the society. This was akin to dancing naked at the market square by us with the ripple effect of the said letter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CJN said the lack of funds owing to the impact of the COVID pandemic affected the operations of the apex court.\n\n\u201cThe supreme court definitely does not exist outside its environment, it is also affected by the economic and socio-political climate prevailing in the country. Besides that, the Apex Court has to a larger extent, been living to its constitutional responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201dWhen a budget is made, it contains two sides, that\u2019s the recurrent and the capital, yet all the two are broken down into items. The federal government releases the budget based on the budget components. And it\u2019s an offence to spend the money meant for one item for another.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, the supreme court budgeted this year to re-roof and rehabilitate its complex built over 30 years ago and that is being done. The work on the extension of the complex is near completion, the esthetic lawns and cleanness of the perimeters are being well kept, and security and water supply are adequately provided for his brother Justices in their offices and residences.\n\n\u201cDuring the period of pandemic, a profound and extra-care were maintained to avoid causalities among them as well as the staff generally. It would have amounted to an act of irresponsibility to divert money meant for the above for otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe accusation so far, in summary, is that more or all ought to have been done and not that nothing has been done; which is utopian in the contemporary condition of our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said before eight new justices were appointed in 2020, \u201cthere was no additional budget to provide new chambers with equipped library, legal assistance, residential accommodations and logistics for them\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe apex court has to make do with the resources at its disposal to meet their needs over time. All the justices of this court has at least a legal assistance, except some may opt for more,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to the allegation of not funding training, he said eight supreme court justices were nominated for a workshop in London two weeks ago and that they would be going in batches.\n\nHe added that \u201caccommodations are being gradually provided for the few that are yet to get\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is none of the apex court justices without SUV and backup cars. If any of them were purchased but refurbished, the external and internal auditors are here in the court to take those that bought them up over it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of electricity tariff and diesel are national problems. The chief registrar might have budgeted for N300 per litre but diesel is now selling for over N700 per litre and therefore has to find a way around it without even bringing it to the attention of the CJN. But there is no way the generator would be put off if the court is sitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe amendment of court rules is in process, it has to be critically reviewed to avoid conflict with the constitution and other extant laws. Not all the CJNs has reviewed the rules in the past.\n\n\u201cThe internet services have been restored to Justices\u2019 residences and chambers, just as some allowances have been paid to them.

Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Afropolitan wants to build a digital nation for Africans",
          "text": "Afropolitan, a startup that wants to build a digital nation for Africans, has raised pre-seed funding of $2.1 million, according to its co-founder, Eche Emole.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Eche Emole and Chika Uwazie, Afropolitan started out as an organisation that organised parties, events, and festivals for the African diaspora. In 2019, it made a name for itself after it organised parties for international travellers who had visited Ghana to attend the Year of Return event. That year, the number of international travellers peaked at 1.13 million, from 960,000 in 2018, which helped contribute an additional $1.9 billion to the Ghanaian economy.\n\nAfropolitan was on its way to organising another edition of its party in Beyond the Return in 2020 when the global pandemic broke out and countries went into lockdown and physical events ceased. But the traction it had gained in 2019 helped it pivot to media. It got on the audio platform, Clubhouse, and built a community of 50,000 black people.\n\nAfropolitan\u2019s inspiration for this digital nation can be traced to an article written by the former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in April 2021, titled \u201cHow to start a new country\u201d in the 21st century. Srinivasan envisions that this new country, the \u201cnetwork state,\u201d he calls it, will be \u201dbuilt on the cloud first. \u201cOur idea is to proceed cloud first, land last. Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with the digital community. We recruit online for a group of people interested in founding a new virtual social network, a new city, and eventually a new country,\u201d he writes.\n\nSrinivasan conceives a network state as a digital nation built without the historical constraints of a physical nation, and that presents citizens with a fresh stab at societal and financial freedom.\n\n\u201cA network state is a social network with an agreed-upon leader, an integrated cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national consciousness, and a plan to crowdfund territory,\u201d Balaji writes in another article.\n\nAlongside Srinivasan who later invested in the startup, there are over 25 other angel investors including Iyinoluwa Aboyeji of Future Africa, Olugbenga Agboola of Flutterwave, Elizabeth Yin of Hustle Fund, Shola Akinlade of Paystack, Ian Lee of Syndicate, Walter Baddoo of 4DX Ventures, Jason Njoku of IROKOtv, Tobenna Arodiogbu of CloudTrucks, Ngozi Dozie of Carbon, and Dare Obasanjo, Senior Product Manager at Meta. Hashed, Atlantica Ventures, RallyCap Ventures, Microtraction, and Cultur3 Capital are among the venture capital firms that participated in this round.\n\nEmole is convinced that Africa has the most need for a digital nation because of the numerous failed states on the continent. He explained that lingering poverty (which sees that 9 of the 10 countries with the highest poverty rates are African), coups d\u2019etat, civil wars and self-imposed autocratic leaders have starved Africa of viable socio-economic opportunities. Emole also said that #EndSARS, a 2-week protest against police brutality in his home country, Nigeria, made him realise that his country had competent people and yet that doesn\u2019t translate to good governance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well the standards are doing when the bad governance shows up. It affects everything around it. We\u2019ve tried engineering our way out of these problems, and it\u2019s not working,\u201d Emole said.\n\nAfropolitan team. Middle: Co-founders: Chika Uwazie and Eche Emole.\n\nEmole said that Afropolitan wants to solve the problem of scarcity that black people face globally, which manifests in an inability to access institutions, money, jobs, and quality living by creating a digital nation that can enable black people worldwide to build abundant lives.\n\nEmole envisions a digital nation as Facebook\u2014the biggest social media platform in the world with over almost 3 billion users\u2014filled with people with shared values and governed by a single cryptocurrency,\n\nAfropolitan\u2019s digital nation will be built in 4 phases. In the first phase, it will admit people into its community or decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), with NFTs serving as digital passports. In the second phase, it will build a super app that will allow people to monitor their holdings, send money to anyone across borders, earn by contributing to the DAO, and buy goods and services from one another. The next phase is what is called a \u201cminimum viable state\u201d which will allow it to offer some government services\u2014case in point, help Africans stuck in the Russian-Ukraine crisis. Afterwards, it intends to push for full-scale sovereignty and acquire physical lands in cities across the world. \u201cThink a \u2018Chinatown/Afropolitan Town\u2019 in every city in the world where our members can establish a physical presence to create economic opportunities. Our network state will serve as the capital that governs these enclaves that will serve as embassies,\u201d Afropolitan said in a statement.\n\nOne of the VCs that invested in Afropolitan, Shima Capital, believes that Africa\u2019s population; macroeconomics and socioeconomic states are similar to the one that positioned the South East Asian region to capture value during the Web 2 technology boom. \u201cWe believe Africa is the next emerging economy that will significantly benefit from the technology paradigm shift from Web 2 to Web 3. For this value capture to take place, you need catalysts like Afropolitan,\u201d Shima Capital said.\n\n\u201cThe African diaspora represents roughly 150 million people, while the continent is home to nearly 1.5 billion, with 70% in sub-Saharan Africa under 30. As such, its demographics make Africa one of this century\u2019s most compelling growth stories; yet its intellectual, creative, and cultural capital remains overlooked, underfunded, and undervalued. Afropolitan aims to change that,\u201d Cultur3 Capital, said. It also said it believes in Afropolitan\u2019s community approach: \u201cTalking about \u2018community\u2019 is easy. Building it is hard. We at Cultur3 couldn\u2019t be more excited to support Afropolitan in its mission to serve the African diaspora\u2019s vast and deep talent. This community-first approach, combined with their unmatched network of Africa\u2019s top entrepreneurs, artists, and creators, will be the key that unlocks the region\u2019s vast yet underrepresented talent.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant, wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Tech firms put brakes on hiring amid global layoffs",
          "text": "Tech companies in Nigeria are starting to put the brakes on hiring as they weigh the impact of the global economic meltdown that has seen venture capital (VC) firms withhold signatures on new funding deals and forced many tech companies to lay off workers.\n\nTech companies worldwide have laid off a total of 39,480 tech workers from January to June across 212 layoff events. With over 10 days still left in the month of June, the figure is likely to increase. So far, a total of 10 companies have announced they are shutting down operations. Bytedance, the parent company of Tiktok, is the latest to shut down a game development studio, 101 Studio, located in Shanghai, sacking 150 employees.\n\nThe global tech industry is grappling with a recent spree in interest rate hikes, the crash and burn of the crypto market, the meltdown of the stock market and the overvaluation of tech startups which raised investors\u2019 negative sentiments towards highly risky assets. Consequently, limited partners who provide the capital that VCs invest in tech companies are reluctant to provide new funding.\n\nAfrican tech companies in the process of raising funds have raised concerns that VCs are pulling back and in most cases refusing to go forward with the deals. The trend appears to have increased in June.\n\n\u201cToo many stories of VCs pulling out after signing term sheets this month,\u201d said Aaron Fu, head of growth at Catalyst Fund. The fund counts many Nigerian tech companies among its portfolio.\n\nSo far, no Nigerian tech company has announced it is laying off workers or even shutting down but the rumble is already being heard from beneath the industry.\n\nRead also: Mass layoffs hit global tech industry as meltdown persists\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing a bunch of companies and employees going through their first downturn, and it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d Chijioke Dozie, co-founder of Carbon, a digital bank, tweeted recently.\n\nHilda Kragha, CEO of the African Talent Company, said the impact had been slow in trickling down to the African tech ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen massive layoffs and pay cuts in the market, although we do see a slowdown in team ramp-ups,\u201d Kragha said. The African Talent Company\u2019s platforms Jobberman and BrighterMonday are involved in recruitment activities in four countries, namely Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda.\n\nLike many experts, Kragha said Africa traditionally lagged behind the rest of the world when it comes to global shocks.\n\nFunding announcements on the continent so far appear to be going on relentlessly. Data from Africa: The Big Deal show that startups on the continent have set new funding records every single month in 2022.\n\nNevertheless, Nigeria, which holds the top position for the country with the most funding in 2021, has so far floundered and yielded ground to Kenya and Egypt. Kenya has seen a funding growth of over 436 percent from January to May, compared to Egypt\u2019s growth of over 212 percent. Nigeria is in third position with over 154 percent funding growth. The African tech ecosystem is still expecting its first one-billion-dollar company or unicorn, a feat that was set in motion in the first quarter of 2021. The ecosystem ended 2021 with about 13 unicorns.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of African startups that benefitted from the generous funding market might be revenue-poor but cash-rich and will have some dry powder to survive the downturn, but they may not have the cash for growth,\u201d Dozie said.\n\nKragha described the downturn as a \u201cmuch-needed rebalancing.\u201d The tech industry has in recent times been dominated by talents asking for salaries that in the past would have been seen as outrageous for a growing space. The consequence was a talent race that only favoured big tech companies with a lot of cash to burn.\n\nThe local startups are left with a lot of vacancies to fill but scarce top talents to recruit. For those that take the initiative to grow local talents, they have to constantly worry about retaining them because big companies could easily poach them with dollar incentives.\n\n\u201cI think in this downturn, we will see more companies focusing on homegrown talent, and nurturing people through their ranks, focusing on succession planning, and building a talent bench rather than buying one,\u201d Kragha said. \u201cThis is good news as it actually deepens skills and grows the ecosystem. Employers will also have to think deeper about developing a comprehensive employee, with creative tools to attract and retain the best talent since cash will not always be on the table.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 alone, software developers in the United States made a median salary of $110,140. The best best-paid 25 percent made $140,470 that year, while the lowest-paid 25 percent made $84,020. In Africa, paying software developers is much lower which informs the mass exodus of hundreds of these talents to either the US or some other countries where companies pay the equivalent.\n\nOlamide Adeyeye, head of research at Jobberman Nigeria, said the \u201crebalancing\u201d would bring sanity in the salary scale, given that layoffs mean more top talents are currently unemployed.\n\n\u201cThe demand and competition make it positive in terms of pricing of talents. Those organisations will now be forced to evaluate the value they place on tech talents in the country,\u201d Adeyeye said.\n\nKragha said the downturn may not affect the decisions of talent leaving the country. This is because young people have various reasons such as better education and healthcare and these are valid with or without the economic downturn.\n\n\u201cI believe such decisions are highly personal and one will still need to examine their circumstances to decide whether they leave or stay. It\u2019s tough either way,\u201d Kragha said.",

          "title": "Half of Africans without electricity live in Nigeria, four others",
          "text": "Almost half of Africans without access to electricity today live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda, a new report by Paris-based International Energy Association (IEA) has said while calling for new investments to ramp up energy access in Africa.\n\nOf these, only Ethiopia and Nigeria made progress in reducing the number of people without access between 2015 and 2019 \u2013 the small rebound seen in sub-Saharan Africa saw about 10 million able to access power even as the pandemic roiled plans for new projects. However, the improved electricity access in Nigeria has not translated to supply for many.\n\nAccording to the IEA report, more than 25 million more people in Africa are living without electricity today compared with before the pandemic.\n\nThe report said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had sent food, energy and other commodity prices soaring, increasing the strains on African economies already hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe overlapping crises are affecting many parts of Africa\u2019s energy systems, including reversing positive trends in improving access to modern energy, the report said.\n\nAt the same time, Africa is also already facing more severe effects from climate change than most other parts of the world \u2013 including massive droughts \u2013 despite bearing the least responsibility for the problem.\n\nDespite these challenges, the report finds that the global clean energy transition holds new promise for Africa\u2019s economic and social development, with solar, other renewables and emerging areas such as critical minerals and green hydrogen offering strong growth potential if managed well.\n\n\u201cAfrica has had the raw end of the deal from the fossil fuel-based economy, receiving the smallest benefits and the biggest drawbacks, as underlined by the current energy crisis,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.\n\n\u201cThe new global energy economy that is emerging offers a more hopeful future for Africa, with huge potential for solar and other renewables to power its development \u2013 and new industrial opportunities in critical minerals and green hydrogen,\u201d he said.\n\nBirol said the immediate and absolute priority for Africa and the international community is to bring modern and affordable energy to all Africans.\n\n\u201cOur new report shows this can be achieved by the end of this decade through annual investment of $25 billion, the same amount needed to build just one new LNG terminal a year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is morally unacceptable that the ongoing injustice of energy poverty in Africa isn\u2019t being resolved when it is so clearly well within our means to do so.\u201d\n\nThe IEA\u2019s Africa Energy Outlook 2022 explores a Sustainable Africa Scenario in which all African energy-related development goals are achieved on time and in full. This includes universal access to modern energy services by 2030 and the full implementation of all African climate pledges.\n\nThe report said that with demand for energy services in Africa set to grow rapidly, ensuring affordability is an urgent priority. But for this to happen, it argues that increased energy efficiency is essential since it reduces fuel imports, eases strains on existing infrastructure and keeps consumer bills affordable.\n\nThe report envisages expansion and improvement of electricity grids powered increasingly by renewables to provide the backbone of Africa\u2019s new energy systems.\n\nAfrica is home to 60 percent of the best solar resources worldwide, but it currently holds only 1 percent of solar PV capacity. Many grids in the continent are powered by fossil fuels and in some like in Nigeria, the grid is unstable, old and in need of overhauling.\n\nThe IEA believes that with solar being the cheapest source of power in many parts of Africa, solar is set to outcompete all other sources continent-wide by 2030 and could open up more energy access.\n\nRenewables \u2013 including solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal \u2013 account for over 80 percent of new power generation capacity added by 2030 in the Sustainable Africa Scenario.\n\nWhile renewables are the driving force for Africa\u2019s electricity sector this decade, the continent\u2019s industrialisation relies in part on expanding natural gas use. More than 5,000 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas resources have been discovered to date in Africa that have not yet been approved for development.\n\nThese resources could provide an additional 90bcm of gas a year by 2030, which may well be vital for Africa\u2019s domestic fertiliser, steel, cement and water desalination industries.\n\nRead also: Electricity operators commit to 5,000MW from July 1\n\nCumulative CO2 emissions from the use of these gas resources over the next 30 years would be around 10 billion tonnes. If these emissions were added to Africa\u2019s cumulative total today, they would bring its share of global emissions to a mere 3.5 percent, the report said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s vast resources of minerals that are critical for multiple clean energy technologies are set to create new export markets but need to be managed well, with Africa\u2019s revenues from critical mineral exports set to more than double by 2030.\n\nToday\u2019s crippling spikes in energy prices underscore the urgency and the benefits for African countries of accelerating the scale up of cheaper and cleaner sources of energy, says the IEA. Africa accounts for less than 3 percent of the world\u2019s energy-related CO2 emissions to date and has the lowest emissions per capita of any region.\n\nIncreased international ambitions for cutting emissions are helping set a new course for the global energy sector amid declining clean technology costs and shifting global investment patterns and African countries are poised to benefit from these trends and attract increasing flows of climate finance, the report said.\n\nAchieving Africa\u2019s energy and climate goals means more than doubling energy investment this decade. This would take it over $190 billion each year from 2026 to 2030, with two-thirds going to clean energy, the IEA estimates.\n\n\u201cMultilateral development banks must take urgent action to increase financial flows to Africa for both developing its energy sector and adapting to climate change,\u201d said Birol. \u201cThe continent\u2019s energy future requires stronger efforts on the ground that are backed by global support. The COP27 Climate Change Conference in Egypt in late 2022 provides a crucial platform for African leaders to set the agenda for the coming years. This decade is critical not only for global climate action but also for the foundational investments that will allow Africa \u2013 home to the world\u2019s youngest population \u2013 to flourish in the decades to come.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHis arrival in the musical space was like that of a meteor. By the time his chartbuster \u2018Efenedo\u2019 was released, Osayomore Joseph and His Ulele Power Sound Band, were already dazzling exponents of the Benin rich musical repertoire. He chunked out one hit after another to the delight of his teeming fans.\n\nBorn Joseph Osayomore Erhinmwioghae, Osayomore Joseph \u201cset forth\u201d very early in life on the path to musical stardom. He had his roots in a family of musical talent; his elder brother, Pullen\u2019s extraordinary musical talent was extinguished by his painful early death.\n\nOsayomore Joseph\u2019s exploits in the Nigerian Army Band were a solid pedestal for his subsequent stardom. If his decision to exit the Army Band to go solo was career-changing; his action in relocating to Benin from Lagos was career-boosting. He immortalised this move with his \u2018Igha ya s\u2019 edo\u2019 (I am going to Benin) which instantly caught the imagination of the Edo people. Osayomore Joseph or OJ to many of his fans and friends, took the Benin musical scene by storm.

The internal wrangling is the only thing that can stop us as it has stopped PDP in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cIf we sue for peace in the party, we will certainly find one. We should try to resolve the internal wrangling within the party as no court case can bring peace unless we sit together to resolve our quarrel.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur aim is to be in power and to be the ruling party. Our collective interest should be our major focus, not our selfish interest which is at the root of the crisis of the party.\u201d\n\nObaseki urged leaders of the party to make ward meetings important and compulsory from this month.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court justices, have written to chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Muhammad, accusing him of abandoning his responsibilities as the leader of the court.\n\n14 justices of the apex court in a letter, ccused the CJN of abandoning his responsibilities as the leader of the court.\n\nSome of the issues raised by the justices include \u2014 accommodation, vehicles, electricity tariff, supply of diesel, internet services to justices\u2019 residences, training for justices and epileptic electricity supply to the court.\n\nThe justices said following the complaints raised earlier in the year, and \u201cafter several persistent requests\u201d to hold a meeting which was finally held on March 31, a \u201cwelfare committee\u201d was set up to aggregate the issues.\n\nThe justices added, \u201cYour lordship received and ignored these demands since 24th March 2022\u201d.\n\nThe justices demanded to know what has become of funds set aside for training of justices since they have been denied the usual two to three international workshops annually.\n\n\u201cIn the past justices were nominated to attend two to three foreign workshops and trainings per annum with an accompanying person for reasons of age,\u201d the letter stated.\n\n\u201cSince your lordship\u2019s assumption of office justices only attended two workshops in Dubai and Zanzibar. They were not accorded the privilege of travelling with accompanying persons as was the practice.\n\n\u201cYour lordship totally ignored this demand and yet travelled with your spouse, children and personal staff.\n\n\u201cWe demand to know what has become of our training funds, have they been diverted, or is it a plain denial?\n\n\u201cYour lordship may also remember that the national assembly has increased the budgetary allocation of the Judiciary. We find it strange that in spite of the upward review of our budgetary allocation, the Court cannot cater for our legitimate entitlements. This is unacceptable!\u201d\n\nOn the issue of healthcare, the justices said: \u201cThe supreme court clinic has become a mere consulting clinic.\n\n\u201cDrugs are not available to treat minor ailments. There is a general lack of concern for justices who require immediate or emergency medical intervention.\u201d\n\nThe justices further stated that the welfare committee submitted their request for diesel allowance, \u201cbecause of the epileptic electricity supply, the astronomical hike in the price of diesel and the fact that justices require electricity to work at home\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe committee also requested for the restoration of our monthly Internet allowance, because we require uninterrupted Internet service in order to have access to materials online to write our judgments,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWith regard to justice\u2019s vehicles, several are due for replacement, while the new Justices have not received their full complement of vehicles to date. Moreover, some of the vehicles supplied to the Justices are either refurbished or substandard.\u201d\n\nThey drew the attention of the CJN to an internal memo stating that \u201celectricity would be supplied to the court between the hours of 8am and 4pm daily, for lack of diesel\u201d.\n\n\u201cYour lordship with all due respect, this is the peak of the degeneration of the court; it is the height of decadence, and clear evidence of the absence of probity and moral rectitude,\u201d the justices said.\n\n\u201cYour lordship, this act alone portends imminent danger to the survival of this court and the Judiciary as an institution, which is gradually drifting to extinction.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary is an arm of government. The supreme court of Nigeria, just like the Presidential Villa and the national assembly, is the seat of the judiciary as an arm of government. The implication of the memo is that this arm of Government is potentially shut down. May God never allow that day.\n\n\u201cYour Lordship, this is a wake up call. Your Lordship must take full responsibility as our leader. You must not concession your responsibility to people who have no responsibility or stake in preserving and defending the dignity of the Institution\n\n\u201cIt is either you quickly and swiftly take responsibility and address these burning issues or we will be compelled to further steps immediately. May this day never come.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court justices, have written to chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Muhammad, accusing him of abandoning his responsibilities as the leader of the court.\n14 justices of the apex court in a letter, ccused the CJN of abandoning his responsibilities as the leader of the court.\nThis is unacceptable!\u201dOn the issue of healthcare, the justices said: \u201cThe supreme court clinic has become a mere consulting clinic.\n\u201cWith regard to justice\u2019s vehicles, several are due for replacement, while the new Justices have not received their full complement of vehicles to date.\nThe supreme court of Nigeria, just like the Presidential Villa and the national assembly, is the seat of the judiciary as an arm of government.",

Kekere-Ekun, Justice John Inyang Okoro, Justice Chima Nweze, Justice Amina Adamu Augie and Justice Uwani Musa Abba-Aji.\n\nOthers who signed the letter include Justice Mohammed Lawal Garba, Justice Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumujimi, Justice Ibrahim Mohammed Musa Saulawa, Justice Adamu Jauro, Justice Tijjani Abubakar and Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim.\n\nHowever, the CJN, through his senior media aide, Mr Ahuraka Isah, said the economic situation in the country was also affecting the running of the apex court.\n\nThe justices had said in the protest letter that, \u201dContrary to what used to be the norm in the past where Justices were nominated to attend two to three foreign workshops and training per annum with an accompanying person for reasons of old age but since the current CJN assumed office, only two workshops in Dubai and Zanzibar were organized and the Justices were not accorded the privilege of travelling with accompanying persons as it was the practice.\n\n\u201cHowever, the CJN continues to travel with his spouse, children and personal staff. The Justices demanded to know what has become of their training funds and whether the same has been diverted despite the fact that the National Assembly has increased the budgetary allocation of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe Justices also demanded provision of qualified legal assistants when lower Courts provide legal assistants for their Justices and Judges. They noted that the Supreme Court, apart from being the highest court in the land, is a policy court which is confronted with various complex legal issues of national significance with the addition of time-bound matters coming in between their regular court sittings and as such require the services of legal assistants.\n\n\u201cOf importance is the state of health care in the Supreme Court which has deteriorated; the Supreme Court clinic has become a mere consulting clinic. Drugs are not available to treat minor ailments. There is a general lack of concern for Justices who require immediate or emergency medical intervention. The justices also noted that the Rules of the Supreme Court are the immediate tools employed by Justices to dispense Justice to Court users but the CJN has kept the amended Rules of Court for almost three years now without appending his signature.\u201d\n\nBut, the CJN in his response contained in a statement on Tuesday, said: \u201cJudges in all climes are to be seen and not heard, and that informed why the CJN refrained from joining issues until a letter, said to be personal, is spreading across the length and breadth of the society. This was akin to dancing naked at the market square by us with the ripple effect of the said letter\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court definitely does not exist outside its environment, it is also affected by the economic and socio-political climate prevailing in the country. Besides that, the Apex Court has to a larger extent, been living to its constitutional responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhen a budget is made, it contains two sides, that\u2019s the recurrent and the capital, yet all the two are broken down into items. The Federal Government releases the budget based on the budget components. And it\u2019s an offence to spend the money meant for one item for another.\n\n\u201cTake for instance, the Supreme Court budgeted this year to re-roof and rehabilitate its complex built over 30 years ago and that is being done. The work on the extension of the complex is near completion, the esthetic lawns and cleanness of the perimeters are being well kept, and security and water supply are adequately provided for his brother Justices in their offices and residences. During the period of pandemic, a profound and extra-care was maintained to avoid causalities among them as well as the staff generally. It would have amounted to an act of irresponsibility to divert money meant for the above for otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe accusation so far, in summary is that more or all ought to have been done and not that nothing has been done; which is utopian in the contemporary condition of our country.\n\n\u201cBefore eight new Justices were appointed in 2020 onto the Apex Court bench, there was no additional budget to provide new chambers with equipped library, legal assistance, residential accommodations and logistics for them. The Apex Court has to make do with the resources at its disposal to meet their needs over time. All the Justices of this Court has at least a legal assistance, except some may opt for more. One of the CJN\u2019s legal assistance (now Justice Aina) was appointed to Abuja FCT High Court last month, while another (Barr Ramatu) died three months back. Generally the Judiciary is looking up to recruitment of more legal assistance and other supporting staff this year.\n\n\u201cBesides, two Supreme Court Justices died within the period under consideration. Both the four retirees and the two departed cost the court some funds in the forms of gratuities and allowances.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, eight Supreme Court Justices were nominated for a workshop in London as the court cannot take all of them there at once otherwise the job would suffer. They would be going in batches. Accommodations are being gradually provided for the few that are yet to get. There is none of the Apex Court Justices without SUV and back up cars. If any of them were purchased but refurbished, the external and internal auditors are here in the court to take those that bought them up over it.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of electricity tariff and diesel are national problem. The Chief Registrar might have budgeted for N300 per litre but diesel is now selling for over N700 per litre and therefore has to find a way around it without even bringing it to the attention of the CJN. But there is no way the generator would be put off if the Court is sitting.\n\n\u201cThe amendment of court rules is on the process, it has to be critically reviewed to avoid conflict with the constitution and other extant laws. Not all the CJN has reviewed the rules in the past. Within the three years his brother Justices mentioned came the pandemic and the judiciary workers\u2019 strike.\n\n\u201cThe internet services have been restored to Justices\u2019 residences and chambers, just as some allowances have been paid to them. The CJN held a meeting with his brother Justices last Thursday and another one is due to hold this week.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the apex court has been receiving at least N110 billion budget yearly since 2018.",

          "text": "Chief Justice Of Nigeria, Tanko Takes Wife, Children Abroad For Workshops But Blocks Us From Overseas Training \u2013 Supreme Court Judges Kick In Memo\n\nThe Chief Justice of Nigeria, Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, has been alleged to be junketing abroad for workshops with his wife, children and backroom staff while blocking other justices of the Supreme Court from overseas training.\n\nIn a protest memo sent to the CJN by the angry Supreme Court judges, the justices demanded to know what had happened to their legitimate entitlements under Tanko.\n\nThe justices of the apex court in Nigeria said their annual foreign training, meant to enhance capacity building for the country\u2019s judicial process, had been blocked by Tanko.\n\nNews Direct had on June 14 reported that the judges also protested over poor welfare packages which they claimed had hindered their jobs.\n\nThe apex court, they said, has been receiving N110 billion yearly since 2018 despite the increase in its size and responsibilities.\n\nIn their letter, the main issues put forward by the justices in their letter through a welfare committee were; non-replacement of poor vehicles; accommodation problem; lack of drugs at the Supreme Court clinic; epileptic electricity supply to the Supreme Court; increase in electricity tariff; no increase in the allowances for diesel; lack of internet services to residences and chambers.\n\nOthers are; internal problems including non-signing of amended Rules of Court for almost three years; sudden stoppage of two to three foreign workshops and training per annum for Justices; and no provision of qualified legal assistants.\n\nIn the same memo, fresh details emerged where the judges accused the CJN, Tanko of junketing abroad with his wife, children, and cronies while denying them (justices) from doing the same.\n\nAccording to Peoples Gazette, the memo read, \u201cIn the past, justices were nominated to attend two to three foreign workshops or training per annum with accompanying persons for reasons of age. Since your Lordship\u2019s assumption of office, Justices only attend two workshops in Dubai and Zanzibar. They were not accorded the privilege of travelling with accompanying persons as was the practice.\u201d\n\nThe justices added, \u201cYour Lordship totally ignored this demand and yet travelled with your spouse, children, and personal staff. We demand to know what has become our training funds, have they been diverted, or it\u2019s a plain denial.\u201d\n\nWhile demanding to know what had happened to their entitlement, they complained that their welfare under the leadership of Tanko was appalling.\n\nAccording to them, in the past, justices of the Supreme Court were nominated to attend more than two workshops per annum abroad with an accompanying person for reasons of age conditions.\n\nBut since the assumption of office of Tanko, the aggrieved justices said they had only attended training twice in Dubai and Zanzibar.\n\nThey added that even with the two trainings, the few justices allowed to travel, the CJN blocked them from travelling with their families.\n\n\u201cYour Lordship may also remember that the National Assembly has increased the budgetary allocation of the judiciary. We find it strange that in spite of the upward review of budgetary allocation, the court cannot cater for our legitimate entitlement. This is unacceptable,\u201d added the aggrieved justices in the letter.\n\nThe justices berated Tanko further, saying his weak leadership had drastically deteriorated the standards known with the nation\u2019s highest court.",

          "text": "Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and others over their inability to come up with their \u201cpermanent\u201d running mates within the time-frame stipulated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe former number two man said the nation\u2019s top job does not need someone who is hesitant to make decision in picking his running mate.\n\nApart from Tinubu, former Anambra state governor and presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) among others, did not meet INEC\u2019s deadline in submitting names of their running mates.\n\nBoth Tinubu and Obi sent placeholders to INEC pending when they would be substituted with substantive running mates, but Kwankwaso eventually named Ladipo Johnson as his \u2018running mate.\u2019\n\nWhat the Electoral Act says\n\nWith the June 17, 2022 deadline, INEC, via its portal, blocked political parties that failed to meet up with the submission of names of their presidential candidates and their running mates ahead of next year\u2019s poll.\n\nWhile Section 29(1) of the 2022 Electoral Act, as amended, provides that political parties shall submit names of their candidates, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for the general election, Section 31 of the Act also gives the political parties the window to withdraw and substitute their candidates, not later than 90 days before the election.\n\n\n\nIn very clear terms, Section 31 states: \u201cA candidate may withdraw his candidature by notice in writing signed by the candidate to the political party that nominated him for such election and the political party shall covey such withdrawal to the Commission not later than 90 days to the election.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor administrative convenience, the electoral body set 6 pm of Friday June 17th, 2022, as deadline for the submission of names of candidates for the Presidential and National Assembly election and 15th July, 2022, for the Governors and State Assembly candidates.\n\nAtiku blasts counterparts\n\nAnd berating his colleague-presidential candidates over their inability to meet up with the INEC deadline on running mates, Atiku, in a statement Monday in Abuja, lashed at his counterparts, especially from the APC, NNPP, and the LP over what he described as lack of clarity and inability to make decisions at a critical time to pick their permanent running mates.\n\nThe PDP standard bearer said picking running mates by candidates vying for any big office like the presidency is very important in a democracy.\n\n\u201cThe office of the presidency needs someone who has the clarity to make decisions without hesitation.\n\n\u201cIn developed democratic countries, the process and picking of a running mate by a presidential candidate is a step to understanding the capacity of a candidate and his capability to do the job,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu hits back\n\nBut in a reaction, Asiwaju Tinubu told Atiku to focus more on resolving the internal crisis within PDP.\n\nTinubu, who spoke through his media aide, Tunde Rahman, told the BBC that: \u201cThe PDP should pay attention to resolving their internal crisis; they failed to fulfill all their internal promises.\n\n\u201cThey should stop the propaganda campaign on Muslim-Muslim ticket, amongst others.\u201d\n\nINEC\n\nMeanwhile, INEC National Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, has said the placeholder concept was not recognised by the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV monitored Monday in Abuja, Okoye said: \u201cThe issue on the legality within the framework is that a presidential candidate cannot run alone and an associate must be nominated which the parties did. As far as we are concerned, the parties didn\u2019t submit the names as a placeholder.\n\n\u201cThe issue of placeholder is a Nigerian creation that has no place in the constitution. The INEC cannot issue a mandate regarding the names to be submitted for these positions.\u201d\n\nTo withdraw the placeholder, Okoye said, such person must submit a withdrawal letter and affidavit addressed to the commission and the party before they can be replaced, ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThere is a period for withdrawals for the placeholders to pen an official affidavit which will be submitted to the commission and the party to ratify it,\u201d he further clarified.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "It was one of the unusual days in Lagos on Monday as many residents spent hours waiting on queues in filling stations at various locations in the state.\n\nThis was as a result of the scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol which affected businesses which depend on the product for power due to the erratic supply of electricity in the country.\n\nSimilarly, the number of commercial vehicles plying the roads was less compared to a regular business day, leaving many passengers stranded at various bus stops.\n\nWhile some were forced to pay extra fares for transportation, others opted to trek to their respective destinations, including offices, markets, and homes.\n\nAmid fears that the scarcity might be a result of industrial action by members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the union said it took a decision to go on strike.\n\nIn an interview with Channels Television, the Lagos Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Akin Akinrinade, explained the rationale behind the fuel scarcity.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAccording to him, the situation across the state is as a result of the operating environment which has become hostile to their businesses.\n\nAkinrinade specifically stated that the petroleum marketers were not on strike as feared but have found it difficult to operate considering the dependence on diesel whose price has skyrocketed.\n\n\u201cMembers of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria IPMAN have shut down their stations, not because we are striking; we are not on strike,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRather, the business environment has been very hostile to us such that we can no longer do business under this condition. For you to load a litre of petrol, you pay in N162 per litre.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN official was quick to say the situation had nothing to do with the removal of subsidy or deregulation of the petroleum sector.\n\nHe listed the high cost of buying petrol at the depots, the high cost of diesel for running their station, and the increased cost of freight as the major factors responsible.\n\nAkinrinade stressed that it was no longer feasible to sell the product at the recommended price of N165 to a litre, adding that the landing cost of petrol was between N175 to N178 naira to the litre.\n\n\u201cYou now have to add the cost of transportation which is between N6 to N8, depending on the distance within Lagos,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf it is outside Lagos, it is much more than that.\n\n\u201cSo, if you add N8 to N162, you already have N170 and the government which is the regulator wants us to sell at N165; we have not even added the charges at the depot and the running cost at our stations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what diesel says now, and you know how epileptic power supply is; we run on generator, using diesel at N800 per litre. There is no station in Lagos that uses less than 50 litres (of diesel) per day.\n\n\u201cSo, our members can no longer sell (petrol) at N165 per litre; in fact, there is no reasonable person in this business that can sell below N180 per litre, so it is not as if we are on strike,\u201d he concluded.",

A Ukrainian official described a lull in fighting there as the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d.\n\nThe latest diplomatic crisis is over the Kaliningrad enclave, a port and surrounding countryside on the Baltic Sea that is home to nearly a million Russians, connected to the rest of Russia by a rail link through EU- and NATO-member Lithuania.\n\nIn recent days, Lithuania has shut the route for basic goods including construction materials, metals and coal.\n\nVilnius and Brussels say Lithuania is implementing new EU sanctions that came into force on Saturday. Moscow calls the move an illegal blockade and has threatened unspecified retaliation.\n\nThe EU ambassador in Moscow appeared at the Russian foreign ministry headquarters on Tuesday, Russia\u2019s RIA state news agency reported. Overnight, the Kaliningrad governor told Russian television EU ambassador Marcus Ederer was to be summoned and \u201ctold of the appropriate conditions involved here\u201d.\n\nNikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia\u2019s powerful Security Council, arrived in Kaliningrad to hold a council meeting, RIA reported.\n\nMoscow had summoned a Lithuanian diplomat on Monday, but the EU has deflected responsibility from the Lithuanians. Vilnius was \u201cdoing nothing else than implementing the guidelines provided by the (European) Commission\u201d, said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nWithin Ukraine, the battle for the east has become a brutal war of attrition in recent weeks, with Russia concentrating its overwhelming firepower on a Ukrainian-held pocket of the Donbas region that Moscow claims on behalf of its separatist proxies.\n\nMoscow has made slow progress there since April in a relentless fighting that has cost both sides thousands of troops killed, one of the bloodiest land battles in Europe for generations.\n\nThe fighting has spanned the Siverskyi Donets river that curls through the region, with Russian forces mainly on the east bank and Ukrainian forces mainly on the west, though Ukrainians are still holding out in the east bank city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nIn recent days Russia has captured Toshkivka, a small city on the west bank further south, giving it a potential foothold to try to cut off the main Ukrainian bastion at Lysychansk.\n\nRodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow separatist self-styled Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, said forces were \u201cmoving from the south towards Lysychansk\u201d with firefights erupting in a number of towns.\n\n\u201cThe hours to come should bring considerable changes to the balance of forces in the area,\u201d he said on Telegram.\n\nThe governor of Ukraine\u2019s surrounding Luhansk region said Russian forces had gained some territory on Monday. It was relatively quiet overnight, but more attacks were coming, Serhiy Gaidai said: \u201cIt\u2019s a calm before the storm\u201d.\n\nAlthough fighting has favoured Russia in recent weeks because of its huge firepower advantage in artillery, some Western military analysts say Russia\u2019s failure to make a major breakthrough so far means time is now on the Ukrainians\u2019 side.\n\nMoscow is running out of fresh troops, while Ukraine is receiving newer and better equipment from the West, tweeted retired U.S. Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, a former commander of U.S. ground forces in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavyweight boxing match. In 2 months of fighting, there has not yet been a knockout blow. It will come, as RU forces become more depleted,\u201d Hertling wrote.",

          "text": "The tobacco industry in Nigeria is allegedly exploiting social networking platforms to promote and market its products in contravention of provisions of the National Tobacco Control Act 2015 and its regulations, a new report has revealed.\n\nThe report launched Monday in Abuja, by the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) also revealed how the tobacco industry captured the virtual space in Nigeria to market its products.\n\nThe Executive Director of CAPPA, Mr. Akinbode Oluwafemi during the public presentation of the report decried how the tobacco industry was making use of social media platforms to aggressively promote sales of tobacco products and a smoking culture.\n\nHe said the research was supported by a grant from the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) on behalf of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog, researched popular social networking platforms between 2016 and 2021 and flagged 226 activities involving tobacco companies and their allies in Nigeria.\n\nThe report documented how tobacco companies while embarking on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities deploy different strategies to gain the affection of policymakers, reflect partnerships and collaboration with state institutions and organisations that ultimately help them build good public ratings.\n\nThe report further exposed growing cases of tobacco industry vendors such as Smoke Box Ng and Da Smoke Hub, allegedly flouting the ban on advertising, promotion, and sponsorships by using their social media platforms to flagrantly market tobacco products.\n\nThe report added: \u201cAs the title suggests, the report documents how the tobacco industry in Nigeria craftily uses social networking sites to burnish their image and foster partnerships with state actors and institutions in contravention of provisions of the National Tobacco Control Act 2015 and its Regulations.\n\n\u201cThe report examined Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedln, and a host of other social networking platforms used by over 100 million Nigerians for the period between 2016 and 2021 and found that British American Tobacco Nigeria (BATN), through its charity arm, British American Tobacco Nigeria Foundation (BATNF), Philip Morris International Nigeria Limited (PMINL) and others operate unchecked in the virtual space and use it to gain favourable public rating while mentioning nothing about the harms of their products.\n\n\u201cCAPPA found that tobacco vendors and distributors such as Smokehubng and Dasmokehub, use their social media platforms to aggressively promote sales of tobacco products and a smoking culture which relies largely on promoting content showing Nigerian music icons smoking profusely.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that the documented visibility activities of the tobacco industry were mostly in the agriculture, education and entertainment sectors of the Nigerian economy which is subtly targeted at fostering engagement and collaboration with stakeholders in the sectors.\n\nSome key findings of the report also revealed that the tobacco industry most preferred and exploited digital and internet channels were: Facebook which was estimated at 40 per cent; Twitter \u2013 36 per cent and Youtube \u2013 14 per cent in the period under review; Instagram \u2013 five per cent; Blog/Website \u2013 three per cent, and Linkedin \u2013 two per cent.\n\nThe report therefore blamed existing gaps in the National Tobacco Control Act 2015 and the National Tobacco Control Regulations 2019, as it pertains to enforcing the ban and endorsement of tobacco industry CSR activities by state actors and institutions for the manipulation of the space by the tobacco industry.\n\nIt recommended that the federal government should enforce penalties for Tobacco Advertising Promotion and Sponsorship (TAPS) and tobacco control violations in compliance and accordance with national tobacco control and policy.\n\nIt also urged the government to revoke all Ministries, Departments and Agencies\u2019 (MDAs\u2019) collaboration with the tobacco industry and their front groups.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Monday said the country has been able to fully vaccinate 21,236,404 of its eligible population with COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSpeaking at a ministerial press briefing organised by the Federal Ministry of Health in Abuja, Monday, the Executive Director of the National Primary HealthCare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib said: \u201cAs at 10pm yesterday, the 19th of June 202, of the 111,776,503 eligible Nigerian residents target for the entire vaccination cycle, a total of 21,236,404 people were fully vaccinated with different mix of COVID-19 vaccines while 28,426,564 people were partially vaccinated, indicating 19.05 per cent and 25.4 per cent respectively.\u201d\n\nShuaib who was represented by Dr. Abdullahi Bulama Garba, said from the above statistics, it was clear that Nigeria was still far in achieving its set target of vaccinating 70 per cent of her eligible population.\n\nHe said more aggressive actions needed to be taken to fast-track the process to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 infection in Nigeria\n\nShuaib said one the major strategies being adopted by the agency to achieve the objective was the introduction of the concept of mass vaccination exercise across the country. This concept, he said, had been further reinforced with concept of service integration where COVID-19 vaccines are given along with other high impact health interventions like routine immunisation, among others.\n\nHe also said another major strategy was, \u201cthe expansion of the vaccination sites to include all the publicly owned PHC, secondary and tertiary health facilities, public, private corporate bodies and selected private health facilities. We have also created mass vaccinations sites in stadium, shopping malls, markets, religious houses, motor packs and in careful selected/trained pharmaceutical stores.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, who presented an update on the state of affairs with epidemics in the country, said the centre was making efforts to keep the various infectious disease outbreaks at bay.\n\nWhile giving updates on Monkeypox infection in the country, the NCDC DG said as of June 19, 2022, 41 confirmed Monkeypox cases and one death had been reported.\n\nHe said among the 41 cases reported in 2022 so far, \u201cthere has been no evidence of any new or unusual transmission of the virus (such as spreading among the MSM group), nor changes in its clinical manifestation documented in Nigeria (including symptoms, profile and virulence) as compared to other countries in the global north reporting cases.\u201d\n\nHe said globally, between the January 1 and June 15, 2022, a cumulative total of 2,103 laboratory confirmed cases, one probable case, and one death were reported to WHO from 42 countries in five WHO Regions.\n\nHe said with the commencement of the Hajj Pilgrimage on June 9, the NCDC supported the Port Health Services to ensure pilgrims met the health protocol requirements.\n\n\u201cWe continue to strengthen diagnostic capacity by adding new laboratories to the COVID-19 network. We continue to engage with states to ensure regular reporting and response continuity.\n\n\u201cWe have ensured continued working with NYSC camps for safe reopening to minimise infection risk,\u201d he said.\n\nAdetifa said the NCDC has been part of many conversations in recent weeks on monkeypox and was pushing for the de-stigmatisation of the disease and renaming.\n\n\u201cGlobal reports report the disease in men aged 0 \u2013 65 with a median age of 37; most self-identify as men who have sex with men,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, NCDC in collaboration with the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom (NVRI), and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), have conducted animal surveillance in Adamawa State to investigate the possible role of rodents in the transmission of the virus.\n\nThe Director of the Department of Family Health, Dr. Salmat Ibrahim gave update on the present challenges posed by female genital mutilation in the country.\n\nShe said about two million Nigerians were still at risk of female genital mutilation, while 200 million persons face similar risk globally.",
