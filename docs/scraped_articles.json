One old person had asthma attack, another died of heart attack. The dead bodies were left in the train. It will be difficult to convey the corpses to the hilltop where we took refuge.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers exchanged fire with the terrorists. They rescued some passengers. The soldiers also killed some of the terrorists.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nThey came in SUVs\n\nHe said the terrorists came with SUVs (Toyota Sharon) and took away a number of passengers during the Monday night train attack.\n\n\u201cI was in Coach SP 17 when the train was hit and derailed. The terrorists, many of them, rushed into our coach and killed a passenger. I hid under the seat and saw them taking away many passengers.\n\n\u201cAn argument ensued among the terrorists after killing the passenger and they couldn\u2019t pay attention to us.\n\n\u201cWe were about 10 that remained in coach when they left. The terrorists proceeded to the VIP coach and abducted many passengers.\n\n\u201cOne of the VIPs, who managed to escape and returned to us, told us that the terrorists filled vehicles with abductees.\n\n\u201cThey came with Sharon vehicles, shot some abductees; but nine passengers were later confirmed dead.\n\n\u201cOthers were severely injured; they were shot in their legs.\n\nEngine man killed\n\n\u201cWe saw the train driver. He came down and attempted to run, but they shot and killed him.\n\n\u201cI saw the terrorists with my own eyes. They were chatting Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar! Come down, come down.\n\n\u201cI was hiding under the seat, praying. The terrorists were two steps away from me, but after killing a passenger, they went out of the train arguing.\n\n\u201cThey abducted many passengers. Later about 300 soldiers came. The soldiers took us to a nearby hill where we sat down.\n\n\u201cThey said vehicles will come to convey us to Kaduna. The soldiers also attended to those who were injured.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers said we should stop making noise and put out light because we could still be in danger.\n\n\u201cWe were at a place after Rijana, about 20 minutes ride to Rigasa Kaduna.\u201d\n\nVanguard News",

The terrorists, many of them, rushed into our coach and killed a passenger. I hid under the seat and saw them taking away many passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn argument ensued amongst the terrorists after killing the passenger and they couldn\u2019t pay attention to us. We were about 10 that remained in coach when they left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe terrorists proceeded to the VIP coach and abducted many passengers. One of the VIP who managed to escape and returned to us, told us that they filled a vehicle with abductees. They came with Sharon vehicles, they shot some abductees in the vehicles but 9 passenger were later confirmed dead others were severely injured, they were shot in their legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw the train driver. He came to us and attempted to run but they shot and killed him. I saw the terrorists with my own eyes. They were chatting Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar!! Come down, come down!!\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was hiding under the seat praying\u2026it remained about two steps for the terrorists to get to me but after killing a passenger, they began to argue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey abducted many passengers. Later about 300 soldiers came. The soldiers took us to a nearby hill where we sat down. They said vehicles will come to convey us to Kaduna. The soldiers also attended to those who were injured. \u201c\n\n\u201cThe soldiers said we should stop making noise and put out light because we could still be in danger. We were at a place after Rijana about 20 minutes ride to Rigasa Kaduna.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome passengers were injured severely. Some old people had trauma, one old person had asthmatic attack, another died of heart attack. The dead bodies were left in the train. It will be difficult to convey the corpses to the hill top where we took refuge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were traumatised for about 2 hours. The soldiers exchanged fire with the terrorists. They chased them and rescued some passengers, but we were really traumatised. Almighty Allah saved us \u201c\n\n\u201cThe soldiers killed some of the terrorists.

O. Oluwafemi, Deputy Director of Public Prosecution, called three witnesses and tendered exhibits. But halfway through the trial, Anyanwu and Chibike on February 4, 2019, went through trial within a trial and the court dismissed the trial within trial after ruling that there was a prima facie case against them.\n\nWhen the case came up on March 4, 2022, the convicts opted for a plea bargain agreement and it was adjourned till March 29, 2022 for sentence.\n\nAnyanwu and Chibike, who were re-arraigned on a one-count amended charge of stealing before Justice Adesanya yesterday changed their not guilty plea to guilty.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cThe court has ascertained from the defendants that they entered into the plea bargain agreement on their own free volition, free from any coercion and that nobody promised them.\n\n\u201cI have considered the plea bargain and sentencing agreement, which was agreed and duly executed between the parties.

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday, rejected the naming of the second Niger Bridge after President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIPOB said the bridge should be named Achuzie or other accomplished Igbo patriots, and not Buhari.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, had disclosed that the Second Niger Bridge was named after the President.\n\nA statement by IPOB\u2019s spokesman, Emma Powerful, said: \u201cThe attention of the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has been drawn to the laughable plan by the Fulani-controlled Federal Government of Nigeria to name the second Niger Bridge after President Muhammadu Buhari by Fulani-controlled Federal Government.\n\n\u201cWe wish to restate our position on this and reject naming the second Niger bridge after the name of a Fulani man who came to power and completely sidelined our people. Under his watch, our youths have been slaughtered by security agents with reckless abandon. Under his watch, terrorists masquerading as Fulani herdsmen have invaded our communities killing innocent men and women after destroying our farms with their cows. These jihadists have raped our mothers and sisters and spread insecurity across our land. How can a man who supervised all these pains on our people be rewarded with immortalising his name among us?\n\n\u201cIPOB is vehemently opposed to naming the second Niger Bridge after Buhari. The bridge should rather be called ACHUZIE BRIDGE or other accomplished Igbo patriots. No Igboman has been named after any big project in the north.\u201d\n\nThe separatist group also dismissed claims by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola that its members tried to disrupt the construction of the bridge.\n\nIPOB described the claim credited to Fashola as a lie.\n\nHe added: \u201cAgain, we want to debunk the allegation by Fashola that IPOB disturbed the construction of second Niger Bridge. This is another lie from the pit of hell. We want to challenge Fashola to substantiate his claims. Did IPOB in any way physical interfere with the construction of the bridge by either directly or indirectly hindering any worker either foreign or local handling the project? Fashola should know that we don\u2019t have his time. He should face his job and not dare us because he is too little to dance to our music.\n\n\u201cSouth East has more credible names and more important persons who the federal government can name the second Niger bridge after. We have a galaxy of accomplished Africans like Chief Chinua Achebe the writer of (THINGS FALL APART), late Chu Okongwu the renowned economics and a simple man of his time, late Cyprian Ekwensi the author of African Night Entertainment, late Alexander Ekwueme former Vice President of Nigeria, late Chief Michael Okpara former premier of Eastern Region, late Dr Akanu Ibiam, late Mbonu Ojike, late Chief Kenneth Dike the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, late Professor Eni Njoku the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, late Dora Akunyili, late Dee Sam. O Mbakwe, late Achuzie, late Phillips Efiong and the living legend Chief Amaechi Mbazuruike.\n\nAll these names mentioned above are eminently qualified for the second Niger Bridge to be named after them.\n\n\u201cSecond Niger Bridge was awarded in 1979 by the Shehu Shagari regime and since then no administration found it worthy to execute it but IPOB agitation for self-determination pushed this APC administration to reluctantly embark on its construction using the funds past Nigerian politicians looted and stashed away in Europe. We are aware of the condition given by a certain European country that they will only release stolen funds stashed away in their country if the funds will be channelled towards the construction of the second Niger Bridge. This is what compelled the Nigerian government to embark on the bridge project not out of love for the Igbo people of Biafra. We reject naming the bridge after Buhari when we have other better names.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: PDP groups clash over zoning",
          "text": "The battle over zoning of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential ticket has shifted to the 37-man zoning committee chaired by Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom.\n\nTwo opposing groups, apparently working for some presidential aspirants, are divided along regional lines over zoning.\n\nOne group is demanding that the ticket be zoned to the South. The other is insisting that the contest should be left open to all contenders.\n\nYesterday, the pro-North group, under the aegis of Justice and Equity Group (JEG), sent a memorandum to the zoning committee. They argued that the interest of the PDP would be better served if the race is left open to all contenders.\n\nIn the memorandum by Ahmed Muhktar, Yemi Arokodare and Chima Ndugbu, the JEG said the opposition party cannot afford the luxury of boxing itself into a regional or sectional corner.\n\nIt further warned that zoning the ticket to any section of the country could drive the party into a costly error.\n\nAccording to the group, what the PDP needs, at this time, is an open and inclusive race in which no member or section of the country is excluded.\n\nThe group urged the committee to be guided by what it described as \u201ccertain pragmatism and practical realities\u201d.\n\nThe memorandum reads: \u201cOur position is that the presidency should not be zoned to either the south or north of the country. Rather, it should be an open race where members of the party from both the north and south of the country are free to aspire to the office of the president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe hold this position with utmost sense of responsibility. It is our firm belief that the interest of the party will be better served when there is no polarity in the contest, especially that arising from regional or zonal sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe equally recognize the fact that the PDP as an opposition party is constrained in some ways. It cannot afford the luxury of boxing itself into a regional or sectional corner.\n\n\u201cZoning the office of the president to any section of the country will drive it into this costly error. What the party needs at this time is an open and inclusive race in which no member or section of the country will be excluded.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the PDP as an opposition party must shun the luxury of taking certain liberties. It should, instead, be guided by pragmatism and practical realities.\u201d\n\nIt argued that a pan-Nigerian disposition will put the PDP in a better stead to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe JEG said: \u201cIf the PDP must win the race, it must close ranks. It must shun any arrangement that could bring about grievance and feeling of exclusion.\n\n\u201cIt should, instead, go into the race more united and more formidable than ever before. An open, free, fair and inclusive primary election will guarantee the party this winning edge.\u201d\n\nBut the opposing group, under the aegis of the Conscience Group (CG), accused those opposed to zoning of hypocrisy and insincerity.\n\nIn its own memo to the Zoning Committee signed by Paul Nwanubia, the group described as unfortunate that some people could be kicking against zoning at this point in time.\n\nAccording to the group, those opposing zoning were the same people that sabotaged the PDP in 2015 because they said that former President Goodluck Jonathan and party leaders from the South did not respect the PDP zoning principle.\n\nThe CG said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the same PDP chieftains who deserted the party to work with Buhari and the APC are now posing as owners of the party.\n\n\u201cThese people are not sincere. They deserted the PDP because they said former President Goodluck Jonathan and the South did not respect zoning.\n\n\u201cWe have not forgotten how they left the PDP in droves to join the APC where they worked for Buhari to win the 2015 presidential election.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s their turn to respect our zoning arrangement, zoning has suddenly become an evil that must be rejected. So, where can an act of hypocrisy and insincerity take the PDP?\n\n\u201cCheck the list of the 2023 presidential aspirants and you will see a preponderance of those that sabotaged the PDP in 2015. What an irony!\n\n\u201cTheir latter day views on zoning and their ill-disposition to the principles of equity and justice smacked of desperation.\n\n\u201cIf others had not stayed back to rebuild the PDP at the time they defected to the APC, on what platform would they be seeking the presidential ticket today?\u201d\n\nThe group urged the Ortom-led panel not to be swayed by what it described as the \u201cantics of desperados\u201d.\n\nThe zoning committee, which held its inaugural meeting on yesterday, is expected to submit its report and recommendations to the party leadership by April 7.\n\nTen aspirants have so far purchased nomination forms to contest for the presidential ticket of the PDP. Four of them are from the North.\n\nThe aspirants from the North are: former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President Dr. Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed.\n\nThose from the South are: Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Pius Anyim; Ovation Magazine publisher, Dele Momodu; an industrialist, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa; a United States (U.S.)-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze and a female contender, Tariele Diana Oliver.\n\nZoning: We \u2018ll come up with acceptable position, says Ortom\n\nFrom Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja\n\nCHAIRMAN of the Zoning Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Samuel Ortom has said that the committee will come up with a position that would be acceptable position for all stakeholders.\n\nOrtom, who is Benue State governor, told reporters in Abuja at the end of the committee\u2019s meeting, that discussions went without rancour.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week, same time, same venue.\n\n\u201cAnd until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn\u2019t any form of tension.\u201d\n\nOther members of the 37-member committee who attended the meeting included vice chairman, Mr. Ndudi Elumelu and a former PDP deputy chairman, Chief Bode George.",

          "title": "2nd Niger Bridge: IPOB replies Fashola, we\u2019re not Boko Haram",
          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has responded to the allegation made by Minister of Works Raji Fashola claiming that the separatist group was responsible for the delay in completion of the second Niger bridge.\n\nA statement on Tuesday to reporters by the group\u2019s spokesperson Emma Powerful noted that IPOB should be commended for keeping the project safe from hoodlums who would hamper its progress.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nPowerful argued that if the project were to have been sited in the north, Boko Haram terrorists would have destroyed it.\n\nThe group also rejected the proposal of the Second Niger bridge being named after President Muhammadu Buhari, describing such a proposal as laughable. It said would prefer such Igbo names as the late Sam Mbakwe, Mbazuluike Amaechi, Dora Akunyili, Achuzie, or Chinua Achebe, among others, to be considered.\n\n\u2018We wish to restate our position on this and reject naming the second Niger bridge after the name of a Fulani man who came to power and completely sidelined our people. Under his watch, our youths have been slaughtered by security agents with reckless abandon. Under his watch, terrorists masquerading as Fulani herdsmen have invaded our communities killing innocent men and women after destroying our farms with their cows,\u2019 the statement read.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u2018These jihadists have raped our mothers and sisters and spread insecurity across our land. How can a man who supervised all these pains on our people be rewarded with immortalising his name among us?\n\n\u2018IPOB is vehemently opposed to naming the Second Niger Bridge after Buhari. The Bridge should rather be called ACHUZIE BRIDGE or other accomplished Igbo Patriots. No Igboman has been named after any big project in the North.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u2018Again, we want to debunk the allegation by Fashola that IPOB disturbed the construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge. This is another lie from the pit of hell. We want to challenge Fashola to substantiate his claims. Did IPOB in any way physical interfere with the construction of the bridge by either directly or indirectly hindering any worker either foreign or local handling the project? Fashola should know that we don\u2019t have his time. He should face his job and not dare us because he is too little to dance to our music.\n\n\u2018Fashola and his co-travellers should know that if not for IPOB that has ensured security in South East, the workers of Julius Berger would have run away from the site a long time ago. If the second Niger Bridge is being done in the North, Boko Haram, Ansaru, ISWAP and the pampered bandits would have chased them away. That shows them that South East is more peaceful than the North,\u2019 Powerful stated.",

His family, the Zambia FA and the government of Zambia have been duly informed.\u201cIf the death of #Zambian doctor Dr Joseph Kabungo at the #Abuja stadium was caused by being attacked by the #Nigerian fans who invaded the pitch, after the @NGSuperEagles lost the@FIFAWorldCup ticket to @GhanaBlackstars, @thenff would be in terrible trouble with @FIFAcom.\u201dNeither officials of the Nigeria Football Federation nor CAF have confirmed the doctor\u2019s death.It was learnt that Kabungo\u2019s family, the Zambia FA and the Government of Zambia had been informed.A Ghanaian sports journalist, Collins Atta Poku, who was also at the venue of the match, alleged that the doctor was beaten to death.In his reply to Osasu\u2019s tweet, Poku posted:\u201cThey beat him, he fell and they throded on him.

          "text": "\u2022Survivors speak of their ordeals, say they saw hell, prayed and prayed\n\n\u2022Buhari: No one will hold us to ransom, orders military to be ruthless with terrorists\n\n\u2022 Amaechi confirms 8 dead, 41 hospitalised, 362 passengers onboard\n\n\u2022TUC, NMA, NBA, NBTE suffer casualties\n\n\u2022Bank of Agriculture MD, Hassan, niece, others still missing\n\n\u2022Life is near worthless under APC, president, says PDP\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Sunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu, James Emejo in Abuja, John Shiklam, Kasim Sumaina in Kaduna, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and Hammed Shittu in Ilorin\n\n\n\n\n\nAs many as 200 passengers might have been kidnapped during Monday\u2019s raid on a Kaduna-bound train by dare-devil terrorists in a well-organised operation, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nA THISDAY special investigation discovered that although 398 passengers bought tickets for the ill-fated trip, only a little over 362 checked in and boarded, out of which eight passengers were killed in the attack, 26 injured, and dozens still missing, while several others were unaccounted for at the time of filing this report.\n\nOne of the eye-witnesses, who had been hauled into one of the small buses brought by the criminals and later escaped, told THISDAY that from all that he personally saw that evening, it was a well-organised operation, as all the terrorists had a walkie-talkie each for ease of communications.\n\nThe lucky passenger, who claimed to have followed their conversations after being put on one of the small bus, said he could hear them in one of their conversations, saying they needed to tidy up the operations and leave quickly, because they didn\u2019t have much time left, apparently being fed with requisite information from those on the other side of the communication.\n\nThis passenger, however, said it was on the basis of this, that he took his chances and jumped out of the bus through the window, saying although they turned back to look at him, they hadn\u2019t the time to chase after one victim, when there were scores others already in their net.\n\n\u201cThey looked at me and also checked their time, and realised there was no time to look for me and just zoomed off,\u201d the source said, explaining that he took advantage of having followed their communication.\n\nThe eye-witness, who said he could recognise all of them if brought for identification, emphasised the fact that they were not only organised but had a rich network of contacts that made their operations and coordination smooth.\n\nWhile confirming that they took with them many of the passengers, the number of which he could not verify, he said they targeted VIP coach upon demobilising the train, where he was seated too, and started first by shooting the security men onboard the train.\n\nHe noted that there were many security men on the train, who obviously were not on the manifest, because they were not added, stressing further that at least, about six of them might have been killed in the operation, aside the eight passengers, who were not so lucky.\n\nUnfortunately, while the development had sounded the alarm bell across the country and exposing the growing insecurity, Monday\u2019s attack was not the first time that the Kajuru station came under threat by terrorists, who had wanted to make an incursion into that sector of the economy.\n\nThey Were Small Boys, Not Nigerians, Who Kept Shouting Allahuhakubar, Survivors Recount Ordeal\n\nHowever, some of the other survivors of the train attack, have also begun to share their own ordeals too in the hands of their attackers, saying those who attacked them seemed more like non-Nigerians and \u2018small boys\u2019 between the ages of 18 and 20, who shouted Allahuhakubar repeatedly as they rained bullets on the train.\n\nThree of the the survivors at the St. Gerald Catholic hospital, however, described their ordeal as horrible.\n\nOne of the survivors, Maimuna Ibrahim, who was shot on the thigh, said it was a horrible experience.\n\n\u201cWe saw hell. I prayed and prayed and prayed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI went to a workshop in Abuja in the morning and I was on may back to Kaduna that same day after the workshop. I was shot on the thigh. But the bullet did not touch my bone. The bullet penetrated out of my thigh.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we suffered seriously, but thank God soldiers came and they really helped us\u201d, she said, adding that, she was unable to walk after she was shot and soldiers had to carry her out of the train to a vehicle by the expressway.\n\n\u201cI was unable to walk, it was the soldiers, who carried me on the back to a the vehicle that brought us to the hospital. They were able to pass over the cliff, carrying us on their backs. Seriously, they tried, because it was not easy climbing the cliff,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe terrorists were moving about in the train, but they did not come to where I was seated. I was hit by the bullet through the window. They entered SP17. As they were shooting, the police security on the train asked us to lie down on the floor of the train so that the bullet will not get at us.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately before I could lie down, the bullet hit me. I saw the terrorists from the window. They were many, they were small boys of between the ages of 18 and 20. They appeared like Fulani. They wore turbans. They don\u2019t look like Nigerians. They were shouting Allahakubar.\n\n\u201cThey abducted some people. I saw them forcing people out of the train. They were beating them as they were taking them out of the train.\n\nThey were shouting Allahuhakubar, Allahuhakubar as the shot sporadically,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking too from her hospital bed, another survivor, Fatima Shuaibu, a student of College of Education, Gidan Waya, Kaduna State, said her sister was killed in the attack. She was being treated for dislocation on her right leg.\n\n\u201cMy sister, Zainab Awal, was shot on the stomach and she died,\u201d she said amid tears.\n\nShuaibu said she was seated by the window when she started noticing flashes of touch lights.\n\nInitially, she thought it was the villagers around the area, but when she suddenly heard a loud explosion and the train went off track, she knew there was trouble as her heart started palpitating.\n\nShe said, \u201cI was seated by the window in the train. Suddenly, I started seeing flashes of touch light, this was around 8pm. Then, there was a loud bang as if something exploded. Then the train went off track as if was falling down. We started shouting and praying.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the train stopped, we started hearing gunshots. The security personnel on the train announced that everybody should lie down on the floor of the train. They attacked the VIP couch, they abducted some people and took them to the bush, they shot other people. They operated for about two hours or so before soldiers and Airforce arrived and they exchanged gunshots.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists came with five Sharon buses and motorcycles. Those who were abducted were taken away in the Sharon buses. The terrorists were small boys of between 18 to 20 years. I saw them, they don\u2019t look like Nigerians. The soldiers rescued us in the train. Those of us who were injured were evacuated from the train. They climbed the cliff with us and took us to the expressway, where vehicles were brought to carry people.\n\nOn his part, also from his hospital bed at St. Gerald, Mohammed Isa, who was shot on his right arm, said the whole episode was like a dream.\n\n\u201cI was seated by the window and they shot me on the right arm. There was an explosion and the train lost control and went off track. All of a sudden, they started shooting at the train from afar, then, they started coming closer. When they got to the train, they attempted to force the door open, but they couldn\u2019t. So they shot at the door and it opened.\n\n\u201cThey were speaking Hausa. It took quite some time before soldiers came and they exchanged fire with them,\u201d he said, corroborating the accounts of others.\n\nYusuf Idris, ex- spokesman to Zamfara State\u2019s former deputy governor, said Alhaji Ibrahim Wakkala was shot in the leg and was currently receiving treatment in a medical facility in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cHe is responding to treatment very well. He is answering phone calls in his bed. I spoke to him and several other people spoke to him also. There is no cause for alarm,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nAt the Army, hospital, journalists were prevented from seeing the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has visited victims of the attacks in the hospitals.\n\nIn a statement issued after visiting the 44 Nigerian Army Referral Hospital and St. Gerald Catholic Hospital on Tuesday, the state government condemned the terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train.\n\nThe statement expressed sympathy and solidarity with all the passengers, and extended its condolence to the families of the those that died in the attack.\n\nThe statement signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, spokesman to El-Rufai, stated that, the governor and his deputy Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, had visited the injured in hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe governor prays for the peaceful repose of the souls of the deceased persons and wishes the injured persons speedy recovery,\u201d the statement stated, stressing that, \u201cwhile the evacuation of passengers from the scene of the attack has been completed, efforts are still being made to account for all the passengers, crew and security officers that were on the train.\u201d\n\nBuhari: No One Will Hold Us to Ransom, Orders Military to Be Ruthless, Directs Integrated Security Surveillance\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, in his first reaction to Monday\u2019s terrorists\u2019 attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, which killed many people and left several hospitalised, said his government would not let anyone hold Nigeria to ransom.\n\nThe president, who reiterated his call on the military to be ruthless with terrorists and other criminal elements, however, directed the security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of the attack and also ensure, without further delay, the release of all the kidnapped passengers on the ill-fated train.\n\nIn addition, the president has further ordered the immediate implementation of integrated security surveillance for the Abuja-Kaduna and Lagos-Ibadan rail lines.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who visited the scene of the attack, yesterday, confirmed the death of eight passengers, and 41 others said to be receiving treatment at the hospital, while putting the total number of the passengers on board the train at 398.\n\nHowever, new information emerging from the attack, has shown that the Secretary-General of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Barrister Musa Lawal Ozigi, and a lady medical doctor with the St. Gerald\u2019s Hospital, Chinelo Megafu, were among those killed by the terrorists.\n\nA former deputy governor of Zamfara State, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, who was also on the train, reportedly sustained a gunshot wound on the leg, and among those currently receiving treatment at the hospital.\n\nAt the same time, the Managing Director of the Bank of the Agriculture (BoA), Alwan Ali Hassan, and his niece, were reported to be part of the missing passengers on the train.\n\nBuhari gave the directive at the State House, Abuja, after being briefed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor and service chiefs as well as the Inspector General of Police, among other top military officers, about the attack by terrorists on the Kaduna bound passenger train.\n\nHe charged the security chiefs to bring back all passengers kidnapped and ensure that each of the terrorists were hunted down and made to face justice for their heinous acts as no one or group should be allowed to make the country prostrate.\n\nPresident Buhari, who reiterated his earlier directive that the military should deal ruthlessly with terrorists, asked them to be more decisive and not spare anyone unlawfully wielding the AK 47 weapon.\n\n\u201cNo one should be allowed to hold the country to ransom,\u201d the President said as he strongly condemned the bombing of the passenger train, which he described as a \u201cmatter of grave concern.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLike most Nigerians, I am deeply pained by this occurrence, the second of its type, which has resulted in the death of a yet to be determined number of passengers and others, who suffered injuries.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the train, a safe means of transport to many, is callous; and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers for the injured,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President commended the Law Enforcement agencies for their prompt response and emergency personnel, who were responsible for the evacuation and treatment of the injured persons.\n\nHe also directed the immediate conclusion of all the processes for the implementation of the integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution for the Abuja to Kaduna railway line, adding that this be extended to cover the Lagos-Ibadan railway line.\n\nHe further directed the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) management to speedily repair the damaged lines and resume normal service without delay.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the closed door meeting with the president, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor said, \u201cWe have come to brief the President regarding the unfortunate incident of yesterday, where some criminals, bandits had gone to lay improvised explosive devices on the rail tracks and a passenger train was demobilised and seven Nigerians were killed, 29 others wounded and some were kidnapped and we are yet to establish the exact number.\n\n\u201cSo, we went to the scene this morning, inspected the entire area and gave out instructions on what is to be done and we have come to brief the president on this development.\u201d\n\nThe CDS said security agencies would build on the lessons they have learnt from the latest incident, while assuring Nigerians that the military and other security agencies would not rest on their oars until everywhere was secured.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe challenge of insecurity is a constant one and so the defence and security agencies need to be on their toes 24/7. This is unfortunate and we believe that the lessons out of this are what we need to build upon going forward.\n\n\u201cI can, perhaps, use this opportunity to reassure the nation that based on the President\u2019s directive, we will take every necessary action, not just to apprehend those behind this dastardly act, but for them to also face justice. Going forward, certainly there will be greater security for the nation and I will like to urge everybody to go about their normal duties.\u201d\n\nApart from the CDS, others who took turns to brief the president were the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Faruk Yahaya; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, as well as the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo and the Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS),Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nAmaechi Confirms Death of 8 Passengers, 41 Hospitalised\n\nMinister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday, confirmed the death of eight passengers, and hinted that 41 persons were currently receiving treatment at a undisclosed hospital following Monday\u2019s terrorists attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nAmaechi, speaking to the press after inspecting the scene of the bomb blast at Rijana, along the Abuja-Kaduna rail corridor, put the total number of passengers at 398.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the figures of missing persons, kidnapped and those injured at the moment. The numbers we have is that there are eight death and 41 passengers at the hospital.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to wait on the security and the Kaduna State government and the Nigerian Railway Corporation are all trying to make contact with those on the manifest,\u201d he said.\n\nAmaechi added that there were a few persons, who were not on the manifest like the staff of the NRC, staff of the cleaning contractor, were not on the manifest and might not be able to completely account for them, noting that for those on the manifest, calls were being made to reach them.\n\n\u201cWe have not being able to install the security sensors, because the procurement process is a bit difficult. It is typical of Nigerians. To shorten the process and save lives like this but because the process is tedious, the approval is also tedious, we have not been able to get that approval that will lead to purchase those items.\n\n\u201cIf those items were here, drones alone will tell you that there are people around the rail tracks, because there are drones, there are equipment that pick sensors if you touch the track but unfortunately the process has not been able to get us that approval for us to import those items. So, for me, I am devastated and I honestly don\u2019t know what to tell Nigerians anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the cameras in the train could not pick what was happening outside, stating, \u201cWhat you need is a camera that shows 100 metres away from the train, there are unknown things carrying gun. Then, we can take precaution but we have done all we need to do in the ministry of transport and we have forward to them for approval but we have not gotten approval.\n\n\u201cThe patrol vehicles are available but they cannot reach everywhere. For the areas the patrol can patrol, it will forestall. We are thinking about the possibility of employing natives until we get those equipment. We also need helicopters, beyond the drones, we need helicopters.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of the train service, Amaechi said, \u201cThe Kaduna state government has advised that we stop it but on whether there is a need, there is a need, because there are those who work in Abuja and go back home in Kaduna. So, we have to provide those service but if it\u2019s going to make us lose lives, we may have to stop it but I don\u2019t think that is the solution.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not in running away from the militants or the bandits; the solution is providing the technology that lets you know that they are around. If it lets you know that you are around, there are two actions to take \u2013 either for the security men to go after them or you don\u2019t ply within that period but the agencies that need to give us approval have to give us the approval, because we need to purchase those items.\n\n\u201cNo matter the cost, you cannot equate it with the eight lives that were lost. The equipment were just N3 billion and we are about to place order for the one in Lagos but we need to know what is happening on the track, it is everywhere in the world. The ministry of transport has finished everything, the other agencies are not under me.\u201d\n\nOn perimetre fencing, Amaechi said: \u201cThe man was doing it but he was not paid and even for areas that have the fencing, they are being demolished and it is high enough to protect one from criminals; it is just for cows.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is technology that lets you know that there are human activities or foreign activities on the track, that way, you can secure the locomotive and secure lives and I had warned earlier that it is important they get us this approval, because human lives would be involved. Since that warning till today, we have had two incident.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of due process is that? When I say due process, it does not necessarily mean BPP but whatever agency it is, they need to get us approval so that we can get out of cabinet. Even if they get us approval, it will take some months to acquire them from overseas to install them.\n\n\u201cWe need to do that to enable us see from Kaduna-Abuja, Itakpe-Warri and from Lagos-Ibadan what is going on so that we don\u2019t continue to lose lives, because lives are important. If we don\u2019t do that, more persons will die. The cost was about N3 billion and the damage here is more than N3 billion. So, if we had gotten the approval, we would have saved the N3 billion and saved lives.\u201d\n\nTUC, NMA, NBA, NBTE Suffer Casualties\n\nAs Nigerians and the world continue to mourn with families of those who lost people in the Monday train attack in Kaduna, information trickling in has indicated that the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC), the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), also suffered casualties of various categories.\n\nWhile some of the associations were still in search of their members, presumed to have been kidnapped by the terrorists, others have identified their members as among those who suffered injuries and were being treated, while some had announced outright, the passing of their members.\n\nThe TUC, an official statement stated, lost its Secretary General, Comrade Musa-Lawal Ozigi, and the Kwara State Chairman, Comrade Akin Akinsola to the train attack, whilst on their way to Kaduna for an official assignment slated for yesterday.\n\nThe NMA too has expressed sadness over the death of one of its members, Dr Chinelo Megafu Nwando, in the terror attack.\n\nPresident of the association, Prof. Innocent Ujah, said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Dr Aniekeme Uwah, that the body was deeply saddened by the tragic, horrific and preventable death of Nigerians during the incident.\n\nNwando was reported to have lost her life from injuries sustained from gun shots, when the train she travelled in from Abuja to Kaduna was attacked by suspected bandits.\n\nThe NBA, on its part, lost Tibilere Mosugu and Farida Sulaiman, to the cold hands of death. The death of Tibilere Mosugu was confirmed by the NBA Kaduna Branch in an obituary announcement signed by Oguguo C.

A source told a national daily that Hassan\u2019s line had since been switched off from the time of the attack.\n\nThe source added that Hassan boarded the evening train going to Kaduna with one of his nieces.\n\n\u201cWe cannot tell if he has been kidnapped or not but we are worried, because we have been unable to reach him since yesterday. His phone lines have been switched off and no one has contacted the bank or any of his family members,\u201d the source close to his family stated.\n\nSenate Tells Military to Bombard Terrorists\u2019 Enclaves\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, called on the Army and Airforce to, as a matter of urgency, bombard terrorist enclaves with a view to restoring peace and stability in the country.\n\nThe call was made amid resolutions reached, following a point of order raised on \u201cthe continuing attacks on communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\nThe point of order was raised by Senator Uba Sani (Kaduna Central).\n\nThe lawmaker, noted that terrorists had in recent times stepped up attacks on some communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cThe latest attacks by these murderous elements took place in some communities in Giwa Local Government, namely Angwan Sarki Yahya, Tashar Shari, Bare-Bari, Tsaunin Natal, Dillalai, Durumi and Jatin Kanwa, all on Yakawada Ward.\n\n\u201cOther places affected include Kaya community, Mai kyauro and Fatika. They killed 50 persons and kidnapped o 100 people. They also made strategic roads in Giwa Local Government no go areas. Not done with their devilish acts, they made an attempt to penetrate the Kaduna International Airport.\n\n\u201cAlthough the attack was foiled by vigilant security operatives, one person lost his life. When people were trying to come to grips with a week-long wanton destruction of lives and property, the terrorists struck again.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, bemoaned the attacks by bandits on a Kaduna bound train carrying over 970 passengers around Kateri-Rijana axis in Kaduna, just a few kilometers to the Rigasa Train Station in Igabi Local Government Area of the State.\n\nSani observed that the forests where the terrorists held sway were not impregnable, adding that, \u201ca comprehensive operational plan, executed with high sense of professionalism and responsibility, total commitment on the part of our security forces and the support and cooperation of the local communities will rid Kaduna State forests of these murderous elements.\u201d\n\nContributing, Senator Gabriel Suswam lamented that Kaduna had become the new theatre of insecurity and said the lingering activities of terrorists in the state made it imperative for the appropriate authorities to take decisive action.\n\nSenator Danjuma La\u2019ah, said if the security situation in the country was not nipped in the bud, political leaders would become the main targets of terrorists.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, in its resolutions, urged President Buhari, to declare full scale war against terrorists, so as to fully secure all our national territory from them in whatever guise.\n\nAttack is Horrifying, Barbaric, Say Northern Governors\n\nThe Northern Governors Forum, has expressed shock and fury over the attack on a train along Kaduna-Abuja route by terrorists, saying the attack was horrifying, barbaric, and totally reprehensible.\n\nChairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, while responding to the development in a statement signed by his director of press, Simon Macham, said, \u201cThe entire governors and people of the region as well as other Nigerians are distressed over the unfortunate attack on innocent commuters by terrorists, who have demonstrated total disregard for human lives and compassion.\u201d\n\nEncouraging security forces to intensify their search and rescue efforts in ensuring that those kidnapped were released without further delay and the fleeing terrorists were arrested and brought to justice, the governors sympathised with the families of those killed as well as those kidnapped or injured.\n\nThe forum also commended the armed forces for their quick intervention, which prevented further escalation of the incident.\n\nLalong said the Forum was working with the federal government and Governor Nasir Elrufai of Kaduna State to ensure that the incident and other recent terrorist attacks on communities in Kaduna were dealt with decisively.\n\nHe called for the support and collaboration of citizens by volunteering relevant information about criminal elements throughout the region and the country, as well as supporting the armed forces to carry out their mandate of security of lives and properties effectively.\n\nThe governors said more investments were being made into the security sector by state governments within the region as part of the collaboration with the federal government to boost the capacity of the security forces to be on top of the situation.\n\nHouse Summons Monguno, Amaechi, Sirika, Baba, Others\n\nThe House of Representatives has invited some of the key security chiefs in the country, including supervisory ministers for a meeting over the recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nThose invited included the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd); Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi; Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal, Isiaka Amao;and Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nOther heads of agencies expected at the meeting starting today include, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Department of Security Services (DSS), Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Managing Railway Corporation and Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n\nThe House urged the federal government through the NSA, Chief of Defense Staff, the Inspector General of Police and heads of other security agencies, to holistically intervene by setting up a Special Security task Force on Airports across the country.\n\nIt urged the Federal Ministry of Aviation, FAAN and other security agencies to put a more proactive measure in securing airports, including a modern security surveillance equipment on the perimeter.\n\nThe resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Chairman Committee on Aviation, Hon. Nnolim Nnaji at plenary, yesterday\n\nMoving the motion, Nnaji recalled that about a year ago, armed bandits attacked the staff quarters the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), at the Kaduna International Airport and abducted about 12 persons.\n\nHe noted that on Friday, 25th day of March, 2022, there was a horrific armed banditry attack at the Kaduna International Airport, culminating in the death of a security guard of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency.\n\nHe expressed concerns that the armed banditry attacks at Kaduna International Airport might escalate to other airports across the country, if not checkmated.\n\nHe also worried that no one was safe to travel by air if positive steps were not taken urgently to safeguard airports from banditry attacks, considering the international standards on airport security management as outlined by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\nContributing, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, lamented that terrorists were now essential threats to the country and Nigeria was hemorrhaging.\n\nHon. Onofiok Luke urged the executive, legislature, federal, state and local governments, to come together and proffer solutions and provide security for Nigerians, which was the primary objective of government.\n\nObi: Worsening Insecurity Depressing, Disheartening\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has described as shocking, the recent terror attacks on Kaduna Airport and on Abuja-Kaduna bound train, saying the worsening level of insecurity across the country was depressing and disheartening.\n\nObi, a presidential aspirant for the 2023 elections, in a statement from his Media Office, said the terror attacks in Kaduna and different parts of the country, had become very worrisome and should serve as a wake up call for the government to beef up the country\u2019s security architecture and be more proactive in handling security issues.\n\nHe lamented that the challenges of insecurity would be too much of a burden on Nigerians already battling with hardship and poverty.\n\nThe former Anambra governor explained that the worsening level of insecurity further aggravated the negative performance of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nWhile condoling with the families of the bereaved and sympathising with the traumatised passengers, Obi urged the different security agencies in the country to remain resolute in the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nUp Your Game, Northern Senators Charge Security Agencies\n\nSenators from the North under the auspice of the Northern Senators Forum (NSF), yesterday, expressed shock and outrage over the Monday night attack on Kaduna-bound train, and asked the military to re-strategise in handling the security situation in the North West.\n\nThe forum\u2019s chairman and former governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, said the attack was a direct dare at the Nigerian state and its security forces.\n\nWamakko, who is also chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence, said the loss of lives of innocent and defenceless Nigerians must be halted immediately.\n\nThe senators described the attack as \u201cheinous and unforgivable\u201d and charged the security agencies to come together and pursue the criminals.\n\n\u201cIt is devastating hearing about the outrageous attack, which was brought to the fore, yet again, the nature of the problem we are dealing with.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that the precious lives of defenceless citizens get perished in the hands of callous and merciless terrorists,\u201d Wamakko said in the statement released in Abuja yesterday, adding that, \u201cThis is yet another wake-up call not only for our security forces, but indeed all Nigerians \u2013 to wake up and be more decisive in ending this menace.\n\n\u201cWe condole with His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, the Kaduna State Government as well as families and associates of those who lost their lives in the attack. But as a tribute to those lost in the attack we must ensure that their lives do not go in vain by bringing the perpetrators to book.\u201d\n\nPANDEF: Attack Is a National Embarrassment\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), has described Monday\u2019s bombing of an Abuja- Kaduna train by terrorists as a national embarrassment and monumental indictment of the nation\u2019s security agencies.\n\nReacting to the ugly incident in an interview with THISDAY yesterday, PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, was of the view that the nation\u2019s security architecture has collapsed as the terrorists were clearly sending a message to government that they were in control and could attack anywhere, anytime as they wanted.\n\nThe group bemoaned the silence of the federal government on the incident, particularly, the silence of the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, whom it described as someone quick to accuse people of trying to destabilise Nigeria.\n\nWhile sympathizing with families of the those, who lost their lives in the horrific incident, the Forum called on President Buhari to do the needful by discarding his nepotic disposition and act as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Abuja Attack is a National embarrassment and a monumental indictment of the nation\u2019s security agencies. These terrorists are clearly sending a message to Nigerian government that they are in control and can attack anywhere, anytime as they want. It shows that the nation\u2019s security architecture has collapsed completely and overwhelmed by this monstrous bandits and terrorists that have made life unbearable for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila Commiserates with Grieving Families, Says House to Investigate Attack\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has commiserated with families, who lost their loved ones in the Monday attack by terrorists on an Abuja-Kaduna bound train, saying his spirit was wounded by the tragic attack.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a condolence message, said the losses to insecurity in the last two decades were needless and must end.\n\nThe speaker said the lawmakers had resolved to investigate the circumstances of the tragic attack and the security response, to understand why these security breaches continued to occur despite ongoing investments.\n\nHe challenged security agencies to redouble their efforts in finding urgent solutions to the repeated killings.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the families, who are now living through an experience that no one should ever endure. The dead, wounded and missing are our brothers and sisters going about their lives. They had families and friends waiting for them to come home last night. Some of them will never go home again.\n\n\u201cOthers will live the rest of their lives with the memory and injury of this tragic encounter. I commiserate with the families of the dead and pray for a quick recovery for the injured. I strongly urge the national security agencies to find and account for all the passengers, who boarded that train and whose whereabouts remain unknown to their families and loved ones.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq Mourns Death of TUC Chair, Others\n\nKwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, yesterday, commiserated with the labour unions and the family of the state council of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) chairman, Comrade Akinsola Akinwunmi, who died in the Kaduna train attack.\n\nIn a statement by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor said, \u201cI send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the trade union leader as well as the labour communities in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer to God to console all that mourn this fine gentleman at this very sad moment. I also condole with the families of all the other victims of the dastardly attack\u201d.\n\nNSIA Gives Police Patrol Vehicles to Boost Highway Security\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr. Uche Orji, yesterday, formally handed-over 16 patrol vehicles to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, to improve the security of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano road.\n\nHe said the gesture was extremely important for the NSIA and for the Nigerian people in view of the current security challenges on the highways.\n\nThis came as the police IG said seven people lost their lives while 29 persons sustained injuries in Monday\u2019s train attack along the Abuja- Kaduna route.\n\nOrji paid his respect and condolences to the victims of the train attack, adding that the development was a constant reminder of the challenges Nigerians face with security, which the police were at the forefront to fight.\n\nHe said the donation which was directed by President Muhammadu Buhari was to \u201censure that the work continues to get done and while it\u2019s not sufficient in any way, we hope it will help\u201d.\n\nResponding, the IGP said the donation came at a time Nigerians were mourning the dastardly acts of the \u201cfew ones in our society or community that will not want to leave us in peace.\n\n\u201cWe have briefed Mr. President of our findings and we will be able to emphatically say that during our tour, we were able to establish that seven Nigerians lost their lives and 29 had injuries.\n\n\u201cThis event came at a time we had respite for sometime on the Abuja-Kaduna road, because of the commitment of the security forces to secure the road.\u201d\n\nLife is Near Worthless Under APC, Buhari, Says PDP\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has condemned in the strongest terms, the continuing insecurity and near worthlessness of the lives of Nigerians under the administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC), following terrorist attack on a Kaduna State-bound train on Monday, March 28, 2022.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the ambush of the train by terrorists, who killed many Nigerians, abducted scores of others in an operation that lasted over an hour, confirmed PDP\u2019s stand that the security command and control coordination structure under President Buhari has collapsed.\n\nPDP said More alarming was the fact this particular attack took place within two days of another on the Kaduna International Airport on Saturday, March 26, 2022, a state controlled by an APC government.\n\nThe PDP insisted that the complicity of silence by the Buhari administration on the Saturday airport attack emboldened the terrorists to assault the train, a development it said further validated its position that the APC administration had conceded sovereignty over parts of Nigeria to terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe continued silence and obvious helplessness of the Buhari Presidency on these deadly attacks on our nation\u2019s key transportation sectors, raise apprehensions of possible complicity at the very top level of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cIt is callous and unfortunate that the APC government, in its usual insensitive nature attempted to suppress information by keeping mute over 24 hours after this horrendous attack, which claimed the lives of promising Nigerians among whom was a young medical doctor, Dr. Chinelo Megafu, who was fatally shot in the ill-fated train travel.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall the confession by a former APC leader that these assailants are terrorists brought from neighboring countries by the APC as \u2018political mercenaries\u2019 to rig the 2019 general elections,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "According to her, \u201cThe terrorists were moving about in the train, but they did not come to where I was seated.\nThe security personnel on the train announced that everybody should lie down on the floor of the train.\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has visited victims of the attacks in the hospitals.\nThe lawmaker, noted that terrorists had in recent times stepped up attacks on some communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\nThis came as the police IG said seven people lost their lives while 29 persons sustained injuries in Monday\u2019s train attack along the Abuja- Kaduna route.",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s inefficient, creates uncertainty, instability\n\n\u2022Canvasses efficient tax administration for increased revenue\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has faulted the nation\u2019s current multiple and overlapping tax system saying it\u2019s inefficient and creates uncertainty and instability.\n\nHe therefore canvassed for efficient tax administration to boost the nation\u2019s revenue base.\n\nSpeaking yesterday while declaring open the second annual National Tax Dialogue Week in Abuja, the president said he was worried about the current tax system in the country, characterised by fragmented administration, multiple and sometimes, overlapping taxes.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cMultiplicity of tax administration is as undesirable as multiplicity of taxes; it creates uncertainty and instability; and above all, it is inefficient.\u201d\n\nHe, however, expressed his administration\u2019s commitment to an efficient tax system in order to improve tax revenue in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201dIn most tax-efficient nations, tax administrative processes and practices are harmonised within a single system.\n\n\u201dOne key deliverable of this year\u2019s tax dialogue is to promote synergy in tax administration among the different tiers of government.\n\n\u201dHarmonising taxpayer identification across the country is a good start; but we must do more to promote ease of doing business (including ease of tax compliance) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dOn our part, we have started by clarifying in the 2021 Finance Act that FIRS is the sole authority to administer tax for the federal government.\n\n\u201dThis clarification became necessary in order to avoid taxpayers being burdened with multiple tax compliance obligations towards different agencies of the same government\u201d, the president said at the dialogue with the theme: \u201dTax Harmonisation for Enhanced Revenue Generation.\u201d\n\nIn the face of dwindling revenues from commodities, Buhari told participants that there was an urgent need to maximise domestic revenue within the extant tax policy and laws.\n\nHe, therefore, proposed improved tax revenue for the country which would not necessarily impose new tax rates on Nigerians.\n\n\u201dWe all know that good intentions are not enough as they simply cannot pay for infrastructure, security or social amenities. We must therefore improve tax revenue without necessarily raising new taxes.\n\n\u201dRevenue from commodities, including crude oil, are too volatile and unreliable. Therefore, I pledge government\u2019s support for any viable initiative for improving tax revenue that should emanate from this dialogue,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio, the president declared that the country also needs to do more in securing a buoyant domestic revenue base of the country that bequeaths an enduring economic foundation, political stability and social harmony to the next generation.\n\n\u201dAccording to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in its Revenue Statistics in Africa 2021, the average ratio of Tax-to-GDP of 30 selected African countries in 2019 was 16.6 per cent while Nigeria recorded a mere six per cent.\n\n\u201dIt is obvious that much needs to be done in the area of tax revenue mobilisation. \u2018It is my expectation that the discussions at this 2022 National Tax Dialogue will be focused on what we must do to maximise legitimate revenue collection and massively improve the tax-to-GDP ratio. \u201d\n\nOn the importance of the tax dialogue, which was instituted by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, and the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Buhari noted that the first edition in 2021, was productive and integral in influencing tax policy, as well as legislative and administrative changes that were introduced last year.\n\nHe added that the most important testament to the success of the first edition was the fact that the FIRS achieved 100 per cent of its collection target in 2021 and surpassed N6 trillion revenue threshold for the very first time.\n\nCongratulating the FIRS on the achievement, the president assured Nigerians that the present administration would continue to maintain prudent management of the collective resources.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said the dialogue was designed to engage stakeholders in the Nigerian tax-space in meaningful discourse so as to glean information, ideas and experience in the aid of policy formulation and improved tax environment.\n\nAccording to her, he main tax revenue objectives of the federal government included developing an economy that does not lean too heavily on resource wealth.\n\nShe explained that Nigeria\u2019s economic history provides enough facts that resource wealth alone cannot lead to sustainable development, self-sufficiency and sustainable.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cThe other tax revenue objectives are:\n\n\u201dTo institutionalise a healthy tax culture among Nigerians. The right attitude towards taxation will enable every Nigerian to become a co-guardian of the tax system and the commonwealth.\n\n\u201dTo create a participatory system of taxation whereby the taxpayers and other stakeholders understand and accept that they have equal stakes in the tax system.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, thanked the president for his directive to government agencies to enable FIRS connect to their ICT systems; noting that this singular pronouncement softened the grounds for the Service to roll-out its system for seamless acquisition of data.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe are confident that by the time all the agencies achieve 100 per cent compliance with the president\u2019s directive, Nigeria shall be the envy of other countries for tax compliance and domestic tax revenue mobilisation.\u201d\n\nOn the remittances of the FIRS to the Federation Account, Nami announced that statistics from March 2022 Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting show that out of a total revenue of N803.072 billion from all revenue agencies, tax revenue contributed by FIRS was N513.522 billion (63.94%) while non-tax revenue from all other agencies amounted to N289.55 billion (36.06%).\n\nHe noted that that the average tax or FIRS contribution to FAAC in 2021 was 59.45%.\n\n\u201dI mentioned in my welcome address to the 2021 edition of the Tax Dialogue that the world had begun a tax race of which Nigeria must be a winner.\n\n\u201dThe revenue profile of the country in 2021 has clearly shown that our continued survival as a nation depends on tax revenue.\n\n\u201dThis trend is set to continue for some time to come. As such, all hands must be on deck to support the tax system and make it function efficiently.\n\n\u201dHowever, it is surprising that some people have begun to play politics with tax revenue generation.\n\n\u201dWe humbly invite the President to step-in to dissuade political tax gladiators to sheath their swords. Tax revenue is an inherently apolitical issue; it should be treated as such by all, irrespective of their political leaning\u201d, the FIRS Chairman said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason Former Lagos Governor, Tinubu Cancelled 70th Birthday Colloquium In Lagos",
          "text": "Former Lagos State Governor and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, was shocked on Tuesday to realise that President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and a host of other dignitaries snubbed his 70th birthday colloquium, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that Tinubu was therefore forced to call off the event which was only attended by two South-West governors and Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje while other expected dignitaries shunned the colloquium, which came only days after the much controversial APC national convention in Abuja.\n\nTop sources familiar with the drama revealed that Tinubu used the Abuja-Kaduna train bombing only as a smokescreen to save face when he realised that the dignitaries had shunned the event and it would not get the momentum he so desired.\n\nAt the Eko Hotels in Lagos, the venue of the 13th Bola Ahmed Tinubu Colloquium with the theme, \u201cPivoting Nigeria Into The New Order,\u201d Tinubu, while trying to hide his displeasure had said, \u201cToday is supposed to be a very joyful 70th birthday of mine living on earth. I give thanks to God Almighty for being able to survive to this age. I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country, very sad indeed, that over 60 people and many more were killed and bombed on a train between Kaduna and Abuja just last night. That is a very serious incident about the security of lives in this country and it calls for a very serious sober reflection.\n\n\u201cFor me to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying myself doesn\u2019t show enough concern for a statesman and a senior citizen of this country. This event should not be held. I have consulted with the people you see around me here and they\u2019ve agreed with me and being a very highly committed democrat, I have given myself to their suggestion that they agree that this event be cancelled.\u201d\n\nHowever, sources told SaharaReporters that Tinubu did not need to get to the venue of the event to make the announcement if he truly cared about the victims of the train bombing, which occurred on Monday evening, the previous night.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claims, the real reason was poor attendance; Buhari boycotted; the Senate President boycotted; only three governors showed up; Ganduje, Oyetola Gboyega of Osun and Lagos Governor, Babatunde Sanwo-Olu.\n\n\u201cEven the new chairman of APC (Abdullahi Adamu) was absent.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason Former Lagos Governor, Tinubu Cancelled 70th Birthday Colloquium In Lagos",
          "text": "Former Lagos State Governor and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, was shocked on Tuesday to realise that President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and a host of other dignitaries snubbed his 70th birthday colloquium, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that Tinubu was therefore forced to call off the event which was only attended by two South-West governors and Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje while other expected dignitaries shunned the colloquium, which came only days after the much controversial APC national convention in Abuja.\n\nTop sources familiar with the drama revealed that Tinubu used the Abuja-Kaduna train bombing only as a smokescreen to save face when he realised that the dignitaries had shunned the event and it would not get the momentum he so desired.\n\nAt the Eko Hotels in Lagos, the venue of the 13th Bola Ahmed Tinubu Colloquium with the theme, \u201cPivoting Nigeria Into The New Order,\u201d Tinubu, while trying to hide his displeasure had said, \u201cToday is supposed to be a very joyful 70th birthday of mine living on earth. I give thanks to God Almighty for being able to survive to this age. I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country, very sad indeed, that over 60 people and many more were killed and bombed on a train between Kaduna and Abuja just last night. That is a very serious incident about the security of lives in this country and it calls for a very serious sober reflection.\n\n\u201cFor me to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying myself doesn\u2019t show enough concern for a statesman and a senior citizen of this country. This event should not be held. I have consulted with the people you see around me here and they\u2019ve agreed with me and being a very highly committed democrat, I have given myself to their suggestion that they agree that this event be cancelled.\u201d\n\nHowever, sources told SaharaReporters that Tinubu did not need to get to the venue of the event to make the announcement if he truly cared about the victims of the train bombing, which occurred on Monday evening, the previous night.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claims, the real reason was poor attendance; Buhari boycotted; the Senate President boycotted; only three governors showed up; Ganduje, Oyetola Gboyega of Osun and Lagos Governor, Babatunde Sanwo-Olu.\n\n\u201cEven the new chairman of APC (Abdullahi Adamu) was absent. The Kaduna incident happened the night before. It was all false that he cared about the train victims,\u201d one of the top sources explained.\n\nSaharaReporters also learnt that by shunning the event, the President and other chieftains of the APC were sending Tinubu a subtle but important message \u2013 you don't have our support for 2023 presidency.\n\n\u201cThey used their absence to send a final message to Tinubu that he won\u2019t be their candidate.

They were said to have assembled at the motion ground of the secretariat, dressed in all-white spiritual traditional attire, while chanting incantations as they performed rituals.\n\nOlanrewaju said it was impossible to engage the locals as they disregarded processes in tabling their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor now, no protest on campus. People and vehicles have been allowed to come in and go out. Everything is calm for now, let\u2019s just put it at that. We\u2019re not supposed to engage anybody because we don\u2019t engage touts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are procedures for doing things. Do you expect us to reason with those who are bringing charms and sacrifices to the university? No, we don\u2019t do that. We won\u2019t do that. We\u2019re more enlightened than that.\u201d\n\nA students union executive at OAU, who also spoke with TheCable Lifestyle, confirmed that activities had returned to the campus.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have protests on campus and there\u2019s no longer any disruption. The protest stopped the day before yesterday at around 4:30 pm. The university has been on top of the matter,\u201d the source said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe school deployed security operatives, both the DSS and the police headquarters in Osogbo, to heighten the security on the campus. This is although they couldn\u2019t do much to totally stop the protest.\u201d\n\nThe tension in OAU had come after Eyitope Ogunbodede, the former VC, was said to have been attacked over the varsity\u2019s land-grabbing dispute with the host community.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any issue with the people of Ife. The group that came are the ones who decided to do what they were doing. Ask one of them. Ours is a global university highly recognised internationally,\u201d Olanrewaju had said.\n\n\u201cTheir forefathers gave the land to us. It\u2019s been there ever since. We cannot, on the alter on sentiments, jettison excellence and bring in mediocrity. Let\u2019s not even use the word community in relation to the hostility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a few selfish people in that community that are against the university. It would be unfair on others to lump all the people of Ife with the greedy but vocal few who have been causing the controversy.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Everything you need to know about Web3\u2014according to a blockchain engineer",
          "text": "\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of the Web3 Foundation, and he predicted then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain, a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications, also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAfter our explainer on Web3, we set out to have a discussion with a blockchain engineer to help break down Web3 building blocks for our readers. We spoke with Mayowa Tudonu, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading blockchain engineers, and he answered some of our readers\u2019 burning questions on Web3.\n\nMayowa Tudonu\n\nTudonu studied computer engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University and, while still in school, started working with Jumia as a software engineer before joining Interswitch\u2019s Research and Development (R&D) as a blockchain engineer. After leaving Interswitch, he joined Buycoins and a host of other DeFi companies.\n\nTudonu is currently building Wallet Cloud, a blockchain wallet-as-a-service platform, which provides an API that allows businesses to use blockchain wallets.\n\nHow would you describe Web3?\n\nTudonu: Web3 is an umbrella term for the blockchain space. Web2 stands for the internet that requires authentication and authorisation, requiring you to provide data to centralised organisations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix. These organisations take a lot of information from you based on your use of the internet, location, and activity.\n\nWeb3 is a disruption to that whole paradigm. The Web3 space is here to decentralise those centralised organisations. A good example is a decentralised finance (DeFi) space where we have a lot of finance applications providing services to you in a similar way to the financial services we have today\u2014savings, loans, and payment services\u2014but you\u2019re no longer expected to submit your information or do KYC. To begin to use DeFi, all you need is a blockchain wallet that is anonymous, does not require a central server to work, can authorise transactions without asking for your email or location, and can sign blockchain transactions independently.\n\nWhat role does blockchain technology play in Web3?\n\nTudonu: Web3 is an umbrella term for the blockchain space, and the blockchain itself is the technology. Web3 is built on top of the blockchain, the core technology that powers it.\n\nWeb3 does not only involve the blockchain space and applications built on it. It also involves the regulations and people in online communities, which would go on to create a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). Communities are not blockchains; they are real people. Web3 is broader in terms of adoption, usage, application, and the consequences of the blockchain technology itself.\n\nWhat role will crypto play in Web3, and how is crypto different from and similar to Web3?\n\nTudonu: Web3 is an umbrella term for the blockchain space, and the blockchain itself is the technology. Web3 is built on top of the blockchain, the core technology that powers it. Cryptocurrency is a facility that enables the exchange of value in Web3.\n\nYou can represent the value\u2014even though not in its entirety\u2014a system provides in Web3 by using a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency, which can be created by organisations and protocols, represents the value that a system provides. For example, the value of USDC, a stablecoin, was created by the Centre Consortium by providing USD in the bank and giving users USDC as a representation. Matic is a cryptocurrency that belongs to a protocol called Polygon, which offers scaling services to blockchain technology and it represents the value Polygon is providing to the world.\n\nIs Web3 an effort to get everyone into crypto?\n\nTudonu: Web3 is an effort to enlighten everyone about the possibilities of the freedom crypto technology provides. It is built to let people see the benefits, move into the space by themselves and attain financial and data freedom.\n\nWhat excites you about Web3?\n\nTudonu: PayPal, TransferWise, and Revolut are financial services that Nigerian freelancers and workers use to receive money from outside the continent. But these services lock up their money just because they aren\u2019t comfortable with their name, location, or region. There are many victims of these kinds of seizures because these financial entities have been designed to profile Nigerians.\n\nSome crypto companies in Nigeria were founded because Nigerian users could not buy cryptocurrency with Coinbase, even though they could receive and send cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is these limitations that Web3 wants to solve.\n\nMeanwhile, with cryptocurrency, no one cares about where you are from.\n\nHow is building for Web2 different from building for Web3?\n\nTudonu: There are significant differences. For example, the technologies in the Web3 space are still nascent and experimental. You can\u2019t compare a Node.js that has been in production for over 13 years to an ethereum created just 7 years ago. Or AWS infrastructure that has been around for over 15 years to a decentralised infrastructure system like IPFS that was created just 5 years ago. You can\u2019t compare the maturity of a lot of these products in Web2 to those in Web3.\n\nThis means that when building for Web3 you need to be more careful and pay attention to security. Some of the tools used in Web3 are new, so, as a developer, you have to learn how to use them, and you need to familiarise yourself with the ever-increasing terms in the space.\n\nWhat are the major misconceptions around Web3?\n\nTudonu: A common misconception about Web3 is that it is a scam; and the idea is prevalent because a lot of people don\u2019t understand it. A lot of people compare it to hot air; or engineers, nerds, and smart people playing around.\n\nSome people are scared that OpenSea, a marketplace that allows you to buy NFTs, will go down and all the NFTs with it. But the way data is stored on the blockchain, if OpenSea goes down, what is on the blockchain doesn\u2019t change or disappears\n\nAnother misconception is in the regulatory space: central banks, because of the blockchain technology\u2019s decentralisation, say crypto is used by scammers and fraudsters\u2014even though fraud is already being perpetrated on existing financial systems.\n\nWho is Web3 for?\n\nTudonu: It is for people across the world alienated from using services that could make them make more money; people whose data are mined for advertising; people who want freedom and who don\u2019t want to live in a centralised world.\n\nWhat are the exciting Web3 projects you know?\n\nTudonu: A good example would be Blockswap, a project that allows you to lock up your money and take advantage of staking technologies to gain yields.\n\nMaple Finance lends money to corporate and institutional institutions because cryptocurrency platforms have a limit on the amount of money they can lend. So, institutions go to Maple Finance, request the amount of crypto they want, drop their collateral, and receive the money. It is a very interesting idea.\n\nHow can Web3 get past the scam narrative that surrounds it?\n\nTudonu: Web3 gives people a lot of power; the power to own their own finances, so, as a user, you need to be more careful, because this time around, you are responsible for your own finances.\n\nCentralised entities\u2014because users relinquish power to them\u2014carry the responsibility to protect your finances. So, if you are going to be investing in the Web3 space, you need to read a lot more; you need to understand the projects you are investing in. You also have to learn better security practices: protect your private keys and store them in a very secure place.\n\nIs Web3 still a fictitious idea?\n\nTudonu: No, it is not. Bitcoin, ethereum, polygon, solana, uniswap are all real projects. Web3 is not in anybody\u2019s imagination. But it is true that it\u2019s still in its early days; there is still a lot to figure out.\n\nHow will Africa benefit from Web3?\n\nTudonu: Web3 can open up intra-African trade, as it is currently very expensive to buy and ship things between African countries. It will help Africans make more money as they can now sell to a larger market. Africa can also benefit from Web3 by playing play-to-earn games to make money.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Buy now pay later (BNPL)\u2014a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees\u2014is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, BNPL activity is beginning to take shape and one of the pioneers in this space, CredPal, on Tuesday announced that it\u2019s raised $15 million in a bridge round comprising equity and debt. This will be used to expand its consumer credit offerings in its home country, Nigeria, and scale across Africa.\n\nLaunched in 2018 by CEO Fehintolu Olaogun and COO Olorunfemi Jegede, Y Combinator- and Google-backed CredPal allows individuals and businesses to pay for purchases in instalments across online and offline merchants, for both large and small-ticket items\u2014from as low as \u20a62,000 up to \u20a65 million. CredPal claims to have over 85,000 active customers and more than 4,000 active merchants.\n\nIn addition to providing infrastructure that allows banks and other financial institutions to deliver consumer credit in real-time, CredPal offers its customers access to credit cards, which was launched in November 2020.\n\nWhen it comes to credit cards, the frequent user wins!\n\n\n\nThe more you use your credit card, the more your reward \u2013 from 1% to 15% across our partnered merchants!\n\n\n\nImagine being rewarded for spending! pic.twitter.com/PCekh7M5oZ \u2014 CredPal (@CredPal) November 26, 2020\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is encapsulate the lifestyle of the average working-class Nigerian and ensure that every person can find something specifically for them on CredPal,\u201d Olaogun said in a recent interview. \u201cFor instance, a professional who earns \u20a6250,000 can get a credit card with a limit that they can pay back at the end of their billing cycle or use it to buy now and pay later.\u201d\n\nWith the new funding, the startup plans to extend partnerships with merchants through its recently deployed CredPal Pay, an omnichannel merchant suite that allows businesses seamlessly accept buy now, pay later. The point-of-sale infrastructure enables BNPL through various means, including a credit payment link, checkout plugin, QR codes, and a transaction management system.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to better credit facilities for African consumers and helping sellers grow their sales is getting a huge boost with these latest milestones,\u201d Olaogun says in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe latest funding brings the total investment secured by CredPal to $16.7 million, per Crunchbase data, having previously raised $1.5 million in 2020, part of which was used to roll out its credit cards.\n\nParticipating in this bridge round are existing investors, including Greenhouse Capital (which is also an investor in Kenya\u2019s BNPL startup Lipa Later), as well as new backers including Uncovered Fund, LongCommerce, First Circle Capital, and Adii Pienaar, co-founder and former CEO of WooCommerce. Meanwhile, a number of undisclosed financial institutions provided the debt facility.\n\nCredPal co-founders Fehintolu Olaogun (left) and Olorunfemi Jegede.\n\nThe funding announcement coincides with a new partnership with Airtel Nigeria to enable consumers across Nigeria to access BNPL to own smartphones and broadband modems, CredPal says, without sharing specific details about the deal.\n\nThe fresh investment will also support the startup\u2019s planned expansion across Africa, starting with Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, and Cameroon, the company said.\n\nWith the bulk of African consumers severely starved of efficient and sustainable credit solutions, the BNPL movement is waxing strong across the continent and so is the competition among players.\n\nLipa Later is one of the early companies in the space in Kenya and there is M-Kopa\u2014which has since expanded into phones and retail products\u2014in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. CDCare, PayQart, and Carbon also play in Nigeria. And in South Africa, there are PayJustNow and Payflex. The latter was recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip.\n\nWhile competition appears to be heating up, there is a significantly large market of consumers and merchants to be tapped. But success will largely be determined by how effectively players can drive the adoption and use of credit financing and cards by African consumers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech.\nThis was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else.\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro.\nHe doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\nIf you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Kainji to subsidy: How Nigeria\u2019s debt drifted from grace to grass",
          "text": "Nigeria first looked abroad for a loan in 1964 to build Kainji Dam, a gigantic hydroelectric dam on the Niger River which a New York Times article at the time described as the country\u2019s \u201cmost ambitious project\u201d.\n\nThe dam at Kainji Island, one of the longest in the world, was supposed to generate 760 megawatts of electricity to light up Nigeria and spur economic development.\n\nA letter dated June 17, 1964 obtained by BusinessDay from the World Bank\u2019s archives shows that the then Prime Minister, Tafawa Balewa, had requested and obtained an $82 million loan from the World Bank to fund the Kainji Dam project.\n\nGeorge Woods, who was the president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an arm of the World Bank Group, had said in the loan approval letter to Balewa that he was confident it would \u201cmark an important stage in your country\u2019s economic progress.\u201d\n\nAlthough it would later cost the government $209 million (equivalent to about $1.3 billion in 2020 dollars) to complete the project, the decision to borrow to fund an infrastructure project was indeed a game-changer for Nigeria.\n\nWhile the Kainji Dam is still standing, 58 years later, not many ground-breaking projects that can stand the test of time have been built since then through loans.\n\nThe country\u2019s latest foreign loan, a $1.25 billion loan from international investors, was not to fund an infrastructure project like Kainji Dam but to finance a wasteful petrol subsidy, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nThe controversial petrol subsidy, which was initially to be phased out this June, will continue for another 18 months until President Muhammadu Buhari leaves office next year.\n\nDespite the obvious drain of the practice on public revenues, Nigeria continues to stick with it against all odds.\n\n\u201cWe are sinking deeper into debt with nothing to show for it in terms of infrastructure development and economic growth,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, chief executive officer of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise.\n\n\u201cIt goes to show that we have not managed the economy well. Our increasing appetite for debt is creating a vicious cycle of more borrowing, high debt service, more recourse to the central bank, more inflation pressures and a weaker currency,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total debt stock has more than doubled since the collapse of oil prices hurt government earnings in 2016, going from N17.36 trillion to N39.5 trillion in 2021, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s lending to the Federal Government, which hit N18 trillion in January 2022, is added to the debt stock, it becomes N57 trillion ($136 billion).\n\nPresident Buhari, who has borrowed the most of any Nigerian leader since 1999, has taken fresh loans of N22 trillion since he assumed power. Yet in that time, the economy has been in and out of two recessions.\n\nHis supporters point to data showing the economy grew at the fastest pace in seven years in 2021 but fail to attribute the growth to the low base effect of the COVID-ravaged 2020.\n\nThey also fail to acknowledge that the economy has shrunk from $546.67 billion in 2014 to only $436 billion in 2021, despite rising population. The shrinking economy has worsened poverty, and unemployment has soared to record levels.\n\nNigeria\u2019s motivation for increased borrowing was to make up for the revenue shortfall caused by low oil prices, which bottomed in 2016. The country has racked up more external debt than any other member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since then, according to World Bank data.\n\nOil prices have since recovered but Nigeria\u2019s finances have not. The country looks less of a major oil-exporting country with each passing day.\n\nFor instance, while Algeria is celebrating a revenue surplus as the Russia-Ukraine crisis drives up oil prices this year and is now giving out cash to the unemployed, Nigeria is borrowing to make up for a severe revenue crisis.\n\nLow oil production caused by reduced investments in its oil sector, as well as the cost of the petrol subsidy, has muted the gains of higher oil prices for Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is the only commodity exporter to have tapped the Eurobond market this year. The country\u2019s desperation was clear to see, given the premium paid to raise the Eurobond.\n\nIn another instance of how other oil exporters are benefiting from higher oil prices, Angola is seeing its currency, the Kwanza, gain substantially against the dollar since the rally in crude oil. Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, has however weakened this year, with the gap between the official and unofficial rate widening to new levels.\n\nWith petrodollars on the decline and debt on the rise, Nigeria needs to utilise debt better and find new ways of bolstering earnings to avert a debt crisis, according to Johnson Chukwu, CEO of Cowry Asset Management Limited.\n\n\u201cOur debt sustainability is weakening as we accommodate more debt. If that continues, the implication is the debt level becomes unsustainable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do now is to boost revenue by attracting private capital, local and foreign, into the economy. When the economy is bigger, the government earns more,\u201d Chukwu added.\n\nYusuf, a former director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, shares a similar view.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to borrow to fund more capital projects and grow revenues by improving the investment landscape of the country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria first looked abroad for a loan in 1964 to build Kainji Dam, a gigantic hydroelectric dam on the Niger River which a New York Times article at the time described as the country\u2019s \u201cmost ambitious project\u201d.\n\nThe dam at Kainji Island, one of the longest in the world, was supposed to generate 760 megawatts of electricity to light up Nigeria and spur economic development.\n\nA letter dated June 17, 1964 obtained by BusinessDay from the World Bank\u2019s archives shows that the then Prime Minister, Tafawa Balewa, had requested and obtained an $82 million loan from the World Bank to fund the Kainji Dam project.\n\nGeorge Woods, who was the president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an arm of the World Bank Group, had said in the loan approval letter to Balewa that he was confident it would \u201cmark an important stage in your country\u2019s economic progress.\u201d\n\nAlthough it would later cost the government $209 million (equivalent to about $1.3 billion in 2020 dollars) to complete the project, the decision to borrow to fund an infrastructure project was indeed a game-changer for Nigeria.\n\nWhile the Kainji Dam is still standing, 58 years later, not many ground-breaking projects that can stand the test of time have been built since then through loans.\n\nThe country\u2019s latest foreign loan, a $1.25 billion loan from international investors, was not to fund an infrastructure project like Kainji Dam but to finance a wasteful petrol subsidy, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nThe controversial petrol subsidy, which was initially to be phased out this June, will continue for another 18 months until President Muhammadu Buhari leaves office next year.\n\nDespite the obvious drain of the practice on public revenues, Nigeria continues to stick with it against all odds.\n\n\u201cWe are sinking deeper into debt with nothing to show for it in terms of infrastructure development and economic growth,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, chief executive officer of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise.\n\n\u201cIt goes to show that we have not managed the economy well. Our increasing appetite for debt is creating a vicious cycle of more borrowing, high debt service, more recourse to the central bank, more inflation pressures and a weaker currency,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total debt stock has more than doubled since the collapse of oil prices hurt government earnings in 2016, going from N17.36 trillion to N39.5 trillion in 2021, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s lending to the Federal Government, which hit N18 trillion in January 2022, is added to the debt stock, it becomes N57 trillion ($136 billion).\n\nPresident Buhari, who has borrowed the most of any Nigerian leader since 1999, has taken fresh loans of N22 trillion since he assumed power. Yet in that time, the economy has been in and out of two recessions.\n\nHis supporters point to data showing the economy grew at the fastest pace in seven years in 2021 but fail to attribute the growth to the low base effect of the COVID-ravaged 2020.\n\nThey also fail to acknowledge that the economy has shrunk from $546.67 billion in 2014 to only $436 billion in 2021, despite rising population. The shrinking economy has worsened poverty, and unemployment has soared to record levels.\n\nNigeria\u2019s motivation for increased borrowing was to make up for the revenue shortfall caused by low oil prices, which bottomed in 2016. The country has racked up more external debt than any other member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since then, according to World Bank data.\n\nOil prices have since recovered but Nigeria\u2019s finances have not. The country looks less of a major oil-exporting country with each passing day.\n\nFor instance, while Algeria is celebrating a revenue surplus as the Russia-Ukraine crisis drives up oil prices this year and is now giving out cash to the unemployed, Nigeria is borrowing to make up for a severe revenue crisis.\n\nLow oil production caused by reduced investments in its oil sector, as well as the cost of the petrol subsidy, has muted the gains of higher oil prices for Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is the only commodity exporter to have tapped the Eurobond market this year. The country\u2019s desperation was clear to see, given the premium paid to raise the Eurobond.\n\nIn another instance of how other oil exporters are benefiting from higher oil prices, Angola is seeing its currency, the Kwanza, gain substantially against the dollar since the rally in crude oil. Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, has however weakened this year, with the gap between the official and unofficial rate widening to new levels.\n\nWith petrodollars on the decline and debt on the rise, Nigeria needs to utilise debt better and find new ways of bolstering earnings to avert a debt crisis, according to Johnson Chukwu, CEO of Cowry Asset Management Limited.\n\n\u201cOur debt sustainability is weakening as we accommodate more debt. If that continues, the implication is the debt level becomes unsustainable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do now is to boost revenue by attracting private capital, local and foreign, into the economy. When the economy is bigger, the government earns more,\u201d Chukwu added.\n\nYusuf, a former director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, shares a similar view.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to borrow to fund more capital projects and grow revenues by improving the investment landscape of the country,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s misplaced borrowing priority",
          "text": "The optimism of Buhari\u2019s government when preparing its budget defies incredulity. It is, however, surpassed by the public\u2019s inertia which goes along with the charade. This is one way to explain the failed revenue targets & increasing deficit financing since it assumed office on 29 May 2015. To be clear, there are benefits to running a fiscal deficit. Sadly, Nigeria\u2019s situation isn\u2019t one.\n\nFiscal expenditure is not tilted towards capital expenditure which this government continues to tout when justifying its borrowings. This government\u2019s capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure has been, on average, about 21 percent from June 2015\u2013June 2021 (the \u201cterm\u201d). One is left underwhelmed with the capital expenditure items and implementation.\n\nDuring this term, total fiscal deficit was approximately N26.2 trillion. Historically, Nigeria\u2019s deficits were funded primarily by borrowing from the domestic debt market & by withdrawals from the excess crude account (ECA). ECA is no longer a viable option as the balance declined from US$2.4 billion as of 31 December 2015 to US$61.0 million as of 20 August 2021.\n\nConsequently, fiscal deficits are being financed by borrowing from the domestic & foreign debt markets. This explains the growth in primary deficits& federal debt. Data from the Budget Office of the Federation shows that total debt service for the term was approximately N13.5 billion.\n\nThe arguments by Olivier Blanchard (2019) on public debt are not applicable to Nigeria, despite the best intentions of its monetary authority. Also, note that the advantages Japan has, as one of the most indebted countries, is that outstanding public debt is denominated in local currency &mostly held by domestic investors.\n\nThe Budget Office of the Federation planned to fund 85 percent of the 2021 supplementary budget deficit of N6.5 trillion with debt (domestic 36 percent, foreign 49 percent).\n\nThe balance to be covered by multi- & bi-lateral project tied loans and privatisation proceeds. This government\u2019s statist stance is evident as sums from privatisation or proceeds of asset sales to fund burgeoning deficits, where considered, have been negligible.\n\nThis government refuses to consider unlocking its dead capital (residential real estate & agricultural land) as identified by PwC. Contrary to some opinions, this government does not have a spending problem. It has a revenue problem. The conscious & continuous reach for the debt lever indicates its lack of imagination in generating revenue or unlocking monetary value in the economy.\n\nMost observers are familiar with the nation\u2019s debt profile in domestic currency. A less discussed topic is the composition of Nigeria\u2019s external debt & the interest burden.\n\nThe obvious fact being that external debt is not payable with Naira. Nigeria\u2019s total foreign debt increased from US$10.3 billion as of 30th June 2015to US$38.4 billion as of31st December 2021. During this period, multi- & bi-lateral loans decreased from 70 percent & 15 percent to 49 percent & 11 percent of total foreign debt, respectively. Eurobonds increased from 15 percent to 37 percent of foreign debt.\n\nRead also: Nigerian states with the highest and lowest debt profile in 2021\n\nDuring this period, average interest rate on outstanding Eurobonds marginally increased from 6.1 percent to 7.3 percent. Based on the principal differential, US$38.4 billion less US$10.3 billion, the implied marginal interest expense on Eurobonds is US$337 million per annum.\n\nThis ex-post analysis serves to illustrate the expense capable of being incurred from increased commercial foreign borrowing at ever higher cost. It also excludes the 7-year US$1.25 billion paper priced at 8.375 percent which was issued on 17 March 2022. One assumes that the Nigerian treasury has cogent reasons for tapping the debt market under its global medium term note programme.\n\nData from the Debt Management Organisation (DMO) shows that external debt service (interest paid & principal repayment) increased from US$50 million in Q2 2015 to US$286 million in Q4 2021. For clarity, interest (& other charges) paid during this period increased from US$31 million to US$203 million, respectively.\n\nEurobonds account for 73 percent of the US$203 million interest expense. Principal repayment increased from US$19 million to US$83 million, respectively. Multi- & bi-lateral loans account for the entire principal repayment. The earliest maturing Eurobond, with a principal sum of US$300 million, is due on 27th June 2022.\n\nThe changing composition of external debt, with commercial debt dominating, will lead to increasing foreign exchange outflows for debt service.\n\nIt behoves the fiscal authority to keep its commercial debt investors sweet. Despite the multitude of risk disclosures in any bond prospectus, and collective action clauses, some investors, like hedge funds, have been known to be unrelenting when seeking repayments in the event of a default.\n\nAn IMF paper on indicators of external vulnerability (2000) noted that external debt-to-exports ratio is a useful indicator of trends in debt & repayment capacity. Debt-to-GDP ratio, the oft cited measure by policymakers, is a supplemental indicator that takes account of the potential for switching from production to exports.\n\nReinhart & Rogoff (2009) show an external debt-to-exports threshold of 30 percent\u201335 percent for developing countries when evaluating debt sustainability. It is a sad state where the officials tasked with monitoring public finance seem wilfully blind to the undue burden placed on future generations. The role of the canary in the coalmine is often left to the likes of this writer & other conscionable analysts.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his government is building sustainable infrastructure, strengthening reforms and enhancing security to ensure the influx of investors into the state.\n\nThe governor, who spoke to journalists in Benin City, said his administration is also expanding the private sector space to make the state an investment hub and ensure sustainable development and economic prosperity for the state.\n\nObaseki noted that there has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnerships with the private sector, from which Edo has reaped immense benefits including the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ossiomo Power Company to provide stable power to government institutions and to also drive the state\u2019s industrial sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis close link with the private sector has also led to the establishment of the 6000bpd Edo Refinery and Petrochemical Company Limited (which is 100 percent complete), a landmark project that shows what is possible with well-intentioned Private-Public Partnerships (PPP). The model that birthed the refinery project is being deployed for similar high-impact development and industrial projects in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cThere is no better illustration of the expanding private sector space than the increased air traffic and high occupancy rate of hotels in the state. When we came into office, there were only two airlines flying into the state, today, there are five of them.\n\n\u201cThe state has generally become more attractive to investments with the influx of investors in real estate, hospitality, oil and gas, industries, technology, agriculture, and manufacturing, among others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the state has improved significantly with the linkage of the Edo State Security Network with the federal security structure. The local actors have leveraged this partnership in terms of training, intelligence gathering and surveillance. This has ensured synergy that has helped in curbing urban crime, banditry and other forms of criminality,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We know we needed to have digital security equipment on the corridors. We applied for it. Let me just stop here so I don\u2019t hurt so many people. But I heard the president has given a directive that the procurement must be completed immediately.\n\n\u201cIf we had those equipment on the tracks, you will see the entire track. And we warned that lives would be lost. Now lives were lost. Eight persons dead and 25 persons in the hospital. We don\u2019t know how many people have been kidnapped. And the cost of those equipment is just N3bn. The cost of what we have lost is more than N3bn.\n\n\u201cWe have lost track. We have lost locomotives and coaches. We have lost human beings. And the equipment is just N3bn. To fix the damages will cost more than N3bn. To imagine that we just said give us the approval and not even the money. At the time we asked for it, Dollar was N400, and now its about N500. When you come with sincerity to government and people are stopping you, it is annoying.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said contacts tracing of passengers had started to identify everyone on board the train.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Kaduna state government and the Nigerian Railway Corporation are all trying to make contact with those on the manifest. There are few persons who are not on the manifest like the staff of the NRC, staff of the cleaning contractor, they are not on the manifest and we may not be able to completely account for them but those on the manifest. calls are being made to reach them.\u201d",

          "title": "Train attack: Names of prominient dead, missing, injured victims emerge as Buhari, NASS drop hint for security chiefs",
          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has confirmed that eight dead bodies were recovered, 26 people injured, with several passengers onboard the Abuja-Kaduna train attacked Monday night by bandits, still missing.\n\nThe train departed Abuja minutes after 6pm Monday evening and attacked between Kateri and Rijana, as bandits bombed the train track leaving it stranded before attacking the train and its passengers.\n\nKaduan state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, in a statement Tuesday said: \u201cThe Kaduna state government has received from the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), the detailed passenger manifest for the Abuja-Kaduna train service AK9 which was attacked by terrorists Monday.\n\n\u201cAccording to the documents received, 398 passengers bought tickets for the trip, but 362 were validated as having boarded the train through the recognized turnstile. The passenger manifest does not include NRC staff and security officials who were on board.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have reported that eight bodies were recovered and 26 persons were injured during the attack. Investigations are still ongoing to ascertain the status of the passengers who were on board the train and remain unaccounted for at the time of this update. Search operations are also being sustained.\n\n\u201cCitizens are requested to contact the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency on the phone line 09088923398, to make enquiries or provide information regarding passengers who were on board the Abuja-Kaduna train AK9,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nThe missing, dead passengers\n\nIn a related development, the Secretary General, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Musa Lawal Ozigi and the Kwara state branch chairman of the union, Comrade Akin Akinsola, were among victims of the Kaduna train attack.\n\nA statement by TUC president, Comrade Quadri Olaleye, said they were on their way to Kaduna for an official assignment slated for Tuesday 29 March, 2022.\n\nWhile expressing sadness over the development, Olaleye urged government at all levels to brace up by ensuring the safety of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cComrade Ozigi served in the capacity of General Secretary, Construction and Civil Engineering Senior Staff Association (CCESSA), an affiliate of TUC for almost two decades before he joined the Congress in 2012. Comrade Akinsola was a staff of Dangote Flour Mill under OLAM. They were both seasoned Trade Unionists.\n\n\u201cWe call on government at all levels, especially the Federal Government to rise up to the occasion to stop the killing of innocent Nigerians. As it stands, nowhere is safe now \u2013 we cannot travel by air, road is not safe and neither is the rail. Is Nigeria a failed state? It is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe Congress condoles with the families and friends of our comrades and the good people of Kogi State for this irreparable loss. May God rest their souls.\u201d\n\nAlso, a female medical doctor with St Gerald\u2019s Hospital, Chinelo Megafu, was also reported to have been killed in the incident.\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director Bank of Agriculture Alwan Hassan and his niece, were among missing victims of the train attack, just as a former deputy governor in Zamfara state, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, was equally shot in the leg.\n\nHe is still in the hospital recuperating.\n\nHassan, whose line was reportedly switched off, it was gathered, may have been one of the victims whisked away by the terrorists with cars the criminals brought to the scene.\n\nCOAS orders\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, Tuesday visited the scene of the train attack, with a charge to troops to gun down the terrorists in the area.\n\nHe was accompanied on the visit by some principal staff officers of the Army Headquarters and the General Officer Commanding 1 Division.\n\nAfter assessing the level of damage, the COAS then ordered troops of the Nigerian Army and other security agencies to intensify their search and rescue operations to hunt down the terrorists and ensure rescue of the kidnapped victims.\n\nIn the same vein, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) expressed shock at the twin attack which it described as unprecedented in Nigerian history.\n\nIn a statement by the state chairman of the party, Hon. Felix Hassan Hyat, the PDP said: \u201cThe PDP received with shock, news of an attack on a passenger train along the Abuja-Kaduna railway last night. This is coming barely 24 hours after a similar attack on the Kaduna International Airport by terrorists in which a staff of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) lost his life.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which bandits and terrorists are taking over communities, highways, and most recently the airport and railway is unprecedented in the history of Kaduna state. Hapless citizens have continued to be killed, maimed or displaced with no signs that the bandits would be slowing down or the APC-led government in the state would bring the insecurity challenge to an end.\n\n\u201cThe current security malaise in the state is certainly not what the people of Kaduna state bargained for. No one could ever have imagined, seven years ago, that a time would come when bandits and terrorists would take over our communities, our highways or even railways in such a brazen and daring fashion. There\u2019s simply a total failure of governance especially as it affects the security of lives and property. This is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBuhari orders security chiefs\n\nAnd in his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attacks and directed the immediate conclusion of all the processes for the implementation of the integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution for the Abuja to Kaduna railway line.\n\nHe also directed that the system be extended to cover the Lagos-Ibadan railway line, a statement from his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, said.\n\nThe president gave these directives in Abuja Tuesday, after receiving briefs from the Service Chiefs led by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, with the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Yahaya, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nThe meeting, held in the State House, also had in attendance the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, Major General Samuel Adebayo, the Chief of Defence Intelligence and the Director General of the Department of State Services(DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nThe statement quoted the president as charging the security chiefs to bring back all passengers kidnapped and ensure the terrorists were hunted down and made to face justice for their heinous acts.\n\n\u201cNo one should be allowed to hold the country to ransom,\u201d the statement quoted the President as saying.\n\nIt further said the president strongly condemned the bombing of the passenger train, describing it as a \u201cmatter of grave concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike most Nigerians, I am deeply pained by its occurrence, the second of its type, which has resulted in the death of a yet to be determined number of passengers and others who suffered injuries.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the train, a safe means of transport to many, is callous; and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers for the injured,\u201d he said.\n\nNASS worries\n\nSimilarly, the National Assembly also expressed grave concern over what it called the worsening security situation in the country.\n\nIt consequently called on the military and various security agencies to carry out full scale war against the terrorists and bandits in all their theatres of cooperation.\n\nIt specifically called on the Army and Air Force to carry out constant bombardments of hideouts of the devilish terrorists.\n\nThese were sequel to urgent motion sponsored to that effect by Senator Uba Sani (APC Kaduna Central).\n\nSenator Sani who rose through orders 41 and 51 of the Senate\u2019s standing rules to get his motion debated, lamented the security situation in Kaduna state , saying it is getting worrisome on daily basis with attendant loss of innocent lives .\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the last one week, terrorists or bandits , have stepped up their attacks in the State with killings of innocent citizens and deadly attacks on government facilities , the latest of which was the Kaduna bound train attack on Monday evening where scores of passengers were kidnapped and some killed.\n\n\u201cThe latest attacks by these murderous elements took place in some communities in Giwa Local Government, namely Angwan Sarki Yahya, Tashar Shari, Bare-Bari, Tsaunin Natal, Dillalai, Durumi and Jatin Kanwa, all on Yakawada Ward.\n\n\u201d Other places affected include Kaya community, Mai kyauro and Fatika. They killed 50 persons and kidnapped over 100 people. They also made strategic roads in Giwa Local Government no go areas.\n\n\u201cNot done with their devilish acts, they made an attempt to penetrate the Kaduna International Airport. Although the attack was foiled by vigilant security operatives, one person lost his life.\n\n\u201cWhen people were trying to come to grips with a week-long wanton destruction of lives and property, the terrorists struck again. Bandits also attacked a Kaduna bound train carrying over 970 passengers around Kateri \u2013 Rijana axis in Kaduna, just a few kilometers to the Rigasa Train Station in Igabi Local Government Area of the State.\n\n\u201cThe train derailed after the first wave of attacks. Grenades and RPG were used. They rained bullets on all the coaches. Some passengers were killed, while many sustained bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cThere are reports that some of the passengers were abducted. The terrified passengers only breathed a sigh of relief when security agencies arrived and secured the train and the area. It\u2019s been a reign of undiluted terror.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that these enemies of the people are getting emboldened by the day. They are becoming more brazen. These blood cuddling vampires have no regard for human life. They have no place in a civilized society.\u201d\n\nIn separate contributions, Senators Suleiman Kwari (APC Kaduna North) and Danjumah La\u2019ah ( PDP Kaduna South ), said heinous operations by terrorists in Kaduna state were no longer news as they happen on daily basis\n\nIn particular, Senator Kwari gave gory details of violence unleashed on passengers of the ill-fated train by terrorists.\n\nAccording to him, those rescued by security agencies out of the 970 passengers trekked in the bush for two hours.\n\nReps\n\nAlso, after an extensive debate on the growing insecurity in Nigeria at the plenary, Tuesday, the House of Representatives resolved that its leadership should meet with the heads of military and paramilitary agencies to discuss the security situation in the country.\n\nThose to appear before the House include the National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd.); Minister of Defence, Maj.-Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.); Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Director-General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi; Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Director-General, NCAA, Musa Nuhu; Managing Director, FAAN, Rabiu Yadudu; Managing Director, NAMA, Mathew Pwajok; and General Manager, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Fidet Okhiria.\n\nDeputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, who presided at the session, said the Committees on Aviation, National Security and Intelligence, Police Affairs, Army, Air Force, Defence and Land Transport would work with the leadership on the probe.\n\n\u201cWe beg that the invitation be sent as soon as possible. Hopefully, we will start the meeting from tomorrow (Wednesday),\u201d Wase said.\n\nThe resolution was based on a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Chairman of the House Committee on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji, titled, \u2018Urgent Need for the Federal Government to Investigate the Recent Attack at Kaduna International Airport and Reinforce Security Surveillance and Personnel in All the Nigerian Airports.\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Nnaji recalled that about a year ago, bandits attacked the staff quarters of the FAAN at the Kaduna International Airport and abducted about 12 persons.\n\nHe also recalled that on Friday, there was \u201ca horrific\u201d attack on the airport, leading to the death of a security guard working with NAMA.\n\nThe lawmaker expressed concern that the attacks on the airport might escalate to other airports across the country, if not prevented.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe House is worried that no one is safe to travel by air if positive steps are not taken urgently to safeguard our airports from bandits\u2019 attacks, considering the international standards on airport security management as outlined by International Civil Aviation Organisation.\u201d\n\nNnaji decried that while flights on the Kaduna route were being suspended over the attack on the airport, a train on the Abuja-Kaduna rail line was also attacked Monday night, with the Nigerian Railway Corporation suspending train services on the route indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that the only means of transportation now to Kaduna is the road. Definitely, if it happens in other places; if they start attacking our airports, the implication is that even the international airlines will stop coming to Nigeria. That is the implication.\n\n\u201cAnd the premium on our local airlines \u2013 the premium on their insurance \u2013 will go up and the implication is that (the cost of) air tickets will double. That is why I am asking that the leadership should come to our aid to see how we can solve this problem. It is not just a committee issue; it has to do with the entire House led by the leadership, to see how we can unravel this situation.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Leke Abejide made reference to a statement allegedly made by Governor , asking the Armed Forces to bombard the forests housing the terrorists and flush them out.\n\nAbejide partly said: \u201cI just want to know whether these bandits live in hell or they live here on earth. If they are living within Nigerian territory, how come our military cannot locate where they are?\n\n\u201cIf you notice now, a former Governor of Zamfara State was shot yesterday in the process of this attack. A lady \u2013 a medical doctor \u2013 was killed that same yesterday in the same attack. Who knows who would be the next? Most of our colleagues here depend on that train from Abuja to Kaduna every week, to visit their constituencies. How long will we continue to be talking about the same problem?\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Majority Whip Mohammed Monguno said: \u201cMy suggestion is that, as part of our resolution, we should call on the executive arm of government to declare a state of emergency on the security sector.\u201d\n\nIn a similar position, another lawmaker, Aminu Suleiman said: \u201cI never believed that this incident really happened. It surprises me and truly troubles me as a person that this thing could happen in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This thing that happened \u2013 that truly happened \u2013 actually challenged us as a nation.\n\n\u201cI think these bandits have taken these deliberate killings to the sovereignty of this country, far beyond what we can comprehend. So, we must accept collective failure.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker urged the House to \u201cpresent a very formidable front\u201d to prevent a recurrence of such attacks. \u201cAnd for it not to happen, somebody somewhere must be held responsible,\u201d he stated.\n\nSuleiman also noted that, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have just been ordinary, that these people drive through the cities and challenge the security of our airport. It is not only reprehensible but also a display of general ineptitude on the part of the security (agencies) responsible for security in our airports.\u201d",

Now, lives are lost. Eight persons dead, 25 persons in the hospital. We don\u2019t know how many persons have been kidnapped. And the cost of that equipment is just N3 billion. The cost of what we\u2019ve lost is more than N3 billion. We\u2019ve lost tracks, we\u2019ve lost locomotives and coaches. We\u2019ve lost human beings.

Of course not,\u201d he said, adding Russia had bombarded Chernihiv \u201call night long\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia said it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital, Kyiv.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded in Kyiv in the early hours of Wednesday, hours after Russia said it would withdraw some troops from around the capital.\n\nKyiv\u2019s deputy mayor, Mykola Povoroznyk, said the capital itself had not been shelled overnight, although gunfire had been heard from battles around the city.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv, probably as part of an effort to refocus on eastern regions.\n\nRussia\u2019s Deputy Defence Minister, Alexander Fomin, said the country would \u201cradically, by several times reduce the military activity\u201d in an effort to \u201cboost mutual trust\u201d in peace talks.\n\nDelegations from Moscow and Kyiv held three hours of discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday aimed at bringing to a close more than a month of fighting in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine said it had proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russia\u2019s invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage.\n\nRussia\u2019s pledge to cut back military activity was met with scepticism. \u201cUkrainians are not naive people,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address.\n\nMr Zelensky said that initial signs from the peace talks were \u201cpositive\u201d, but added that they did not \u201cdrown out\u201d the explosions of Russian shells.\n\nOther countries also reacted with caution. US President Joe Biden said: \u201cI don\u2019t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.\u201d\n\nLeaders from UK, France, Germany and Italy also urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia.\n\nIn his comments on Telegram, Mr Chaus said Russian forces had been \u201ccarrying out strikes on [the city of] Nizhyn, including air strikes, and all night long they hit [the city of] Chernihiv\u201d.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to confirm this independently.\n\nOne resident of Chernihiv told the BBC: \u201cThis night was rough. We heard there was fighting all night in the suburbs, away from the city centre. We heard artillery. But there was no aviation tonight.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Chernihiv city, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said Russia\u2019s pledge to ease its assaults on Kyiv and Chernihiv would be good news if it could be trusted.\n\nHe told the BBC that as recently as Tuesday, \u201cinhuman artillery shelling of several residential areas of the city took place, where about 35 people were hospitalised, where people lost their legs and some people were killed\u201d.",

          "text": "Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism, a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s happening on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d\n\nStill, Tuesday\u2019s talks sketched out what could end up being a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll, with thousands dead and more than 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. The talks had been expected to resume on Wednesday, but with what Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called \u201cmeaningful\u201d progress made, the two sides decided to return home for consultations.\n\nAt the conference in Istanbul, Ukraine\u2019s delegation laid a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations.\n\nRussian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said Moscow would in the meantime \u201cfundamentally \u2026 cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv\u201d to \u201cincrease mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.\u201d\n\nHe did not spell out what that would mean in practical terms.\n\nRussian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky said negotiators would take Ukraine\u2019s proposals to Russian President Vladimir Putin and then Moscow would provide a response, but he did not say when.\n\nCavusoglu said he expected a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers at an unspecified time. Another between the presidents of the two countries is also \u201con the agenda,\u201d he said. Russian state news agency Tass reported that Moscow\u2019s delegates arrived back in Russia late Tuesday.\n\nIn the wake of the flurry of proposals and some muted optimism, Zelenskyy warned the world and his own people not to get ahead of themselves. He said Ukrainian troops had forced Russia\u2019s hand, adding that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t let down our guard\u201d because the invading army can still carry out attacks.\n\n\u201cUkrainians are not na\u00efve people,\u201d he said. \u201cUkrainians have already learned during the 34 days of the invasion and during the past eight years of war in the Donbas that you can trust only concrete results.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and others also expressed doubts about Russia\u2019s intentions.\n\nWhile Moscow portrayed it as a goodwill gesture, its ground troops have become bogged down and taken heavy losses in their attempts to seize Kyiv and other cities. Last week and again on Tuesday, the Kremlin seemed to lower its war aims, saying its \u201cmain goal\u201d is gaining control of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe judge the Russian military machine by its actions, not just its words,\u201d British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some skepticism that it will regroup to attack again rather than seriously engaging in diplomacy.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cof course the door to diplomacy will always be left ajar, but I don\u2019t think you can trust what is coming out of the mouth of Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Russia stating a focus on Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region \u201cis likely a tacit admission that it is struggling to sustain more than one significant axis of advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganize and supply,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cSuch activity is placing further pressure on Russia\u2019s already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having reorganizing its units in forward areas within Ukraine.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria has lost over $14 billion yearly due to the frequent farmer-herder clashes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday.\n\nOsinbajo made the disclosure in Lagos, while declaring this year\u2019s Livestock and Aquaculture Trade Fair open.\n\nRepresented by the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) Delivery Advisor at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development, Efosa Onyezebe, the vice president, noted that it was disheartening that a country whose population was projected to rise to over 250 million by 2030, was suffering such a huge loss because of clashes between farmers and herdsmen.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, in order to tackle the challenge, the federal government initiated the NLTP to support and strengthen the development of market-driven ranches in the livestock ecosystem for improved productivity through breed (genetic) improvement and pasture production, in addition to efficient land and water productivity improvement.\n\nThe vice president explained that under the programme, about 22 states have so far sent letters of expression of interest, adding that 10 states have set up the state Livestock Transformation Office, just as four states have identified and mapped the gazetted grazing reserves in their domains and are ready for take-off.\n\nHe said some states have received funding for the development of the pilot ranches.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Agriculture & Rural Development, Mahmood Abubakar, called for the development of the nation\u2019s fishing industry.\n\nRepresented by Mrs. Omolara Oguntuyi, Abubakar noted that the nation has no business importing fish going by the nation\u2019s abundant marine resources.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cIf you look at Nigeria\u2019s capacity for producing fish for example, it is enormous, and truly we don\u2019t have any business importing fish. Fish do not grow on sand but in water and the country is blessed with abundant amount of water. We have lakes, creeks, rivers and Atlantic Ocean all filled with different kinds of fishes.\n\n\u201cWe also have diversity of fishes in our waters. So, what we should be doing is to take advantage of these natural resources which has been ignored for a very long time.\n\n\u201cA typical example is the abundant stock of shrimps in our water, drift fish and large lantern fish population that we can use to make our fish feed which is important to aquaculture production.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe have to develop our fishing industry and not be dependent on importation. God did not make a mistake when He gave us the Atlantic Ocean and those lakes we have, it is only a prodigal child that will have resources and will not use it and instead be looking at what others have.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we can do now is to promote what we have within our own country and a lot can be achieved in the livestock and aquaculture production. We have cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry, rabbit, snail, tilapia and catfish among others that we can promote.\n\n\u201cA lot of farm estates can be promoted, cage culture can be constructed within some of our rivers so that we can produce a lot of our own animals and fish needs.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that is unacceptable is for Nigeria to be totally dependent on other countries for animal protein source when we have land and water we are not making use of.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe time is ripe for us to revolutionise agriculture in Nigeria especially in the livestock and aquaculture development and the youths should be the bedrock of our drive to transform this sector in agriculture,\u201d he added.\n\nGoddy Egene and Ebiti Yusuf",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika has insisted that the planned national carrier which is billed to commence operation later this year would be private sector driven as the federal government would only have five per cent stake.\n\nThe minister made this known on Tuesday while fielding questions during the discussion on the future of global aviation at the ongoing World Government Summit Dubai Expo 2020, where he reiterated that members of the public would have 95 per cent stake in the national carrier with the core investor holding 49 per cent equity.\n\nSirika said aviation remains the fastest growing sector of the nation\u2019s economy since the COVID-19 lockdown and described the country as the best place for airline business in Africa.\n\nHe said available statistics had been giving the federal government cause for cheers, saying the serviceable airports and prospecting airlines had both doubled, adding that aviation had been positioned as the fastest growing sector of the national economy.\n\nSirika also stated that the Aviation Road Map programme developed by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was running its full course with planned actualisation of the national carrier, setting up of an aircraft maintenance facility, leasing company, aerospace university and concession of major airports in the country.\n\nThe minister stressed that Nigeria needs a national carrier because of its 200 million population, most of whom are very mobile and exploiting all modes of transportation, including air transport, which has recorded increasing passenger traffic since after the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nHe pointed out that international carriers jostle to operate in the Nigerian route and demand multiple entry points because of the country\u2019s high traffic and stressed that the present administration has succeeded in expanding the nation\u2019s airport capacity to 50 million passengers per annum.\n\nHowever, the President of Emirates, Sir Timothy Clarke, pledged that Emirates would be willing to provide support to the Nigerian flag carrier start-up and would also be available for collaboration to aid the speedy growth of new carrier, Nigeria Air.\n\nMeanwhile the President, Airport Council International (ACI) H.E. Luis Oliveira, said Africa, which comprised 15 per cent of the global population accounted for merely two per cent of the global traffic, adding that Africa deserved all the support she could get to improve her air transport in all facets of the business.",
