Fulani terrorists masquerading as politicians and security agents are the ones heading Nigeria Army, Police and other security agencies and are responsible for the recruitment of terrorists who were massacring innocent Christians, Muslims and Non-Muslims.\n\n\u201cWe are equally advising the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, to stop condemning attacks from these terrorists from the Sahel or praying for God\u2019s intervention and start acting in defence of Christians in Nigeria. \u201cCONDEMN\u201d do not raise people from graves; therefore, we suggest again to the Christian Association of Nigeria CAN that the only remedy is to be prepared to withstand the terrorists and jihadists who were sponsored by unfortunate politicians and the Government of Nigeria to eliminate every citizen in the country.\u201d\n\nIPOB assured that the Eastern Security Network, ESN, has the training to confront terrorists causing insecurity in the Southern part of the country.\n\nThe group called for the support of politicians, clergymen, and Nigerians in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cAll children of God and religious bodies throughout Biafraland should as a matter of urgency, support this call now that we have the right people and perfect arrangements to safeguard our land,\u201d he added.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDescribing the move as a joke taken too far , the Presidential hopefuls disclosed that the move is in total absurdity as against the directive of President Buhari.\n\nThe aspirants namely; Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade; former minister for state for Education,Emeka Nwajiuba; former Minister for science and technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, former governor Rochas Okorocha and businessman Tein Jack-Rich in a joint statement issued by Ogbonnaya Onu on their behalf distanced themselves from the purported list.\n\nAccording to them, the motive of the Governors is in their personal selfish interest not the South . They also clarified that at no time the President equivocally support zoning of the Presidency to the South , saying that though they were support of the Presidency to the South especially the Southeast neither them nor other South-East Presidential aspirants were consulted before any or such decision was taken.\n\nUrging Nigerians to disregard the report, Onu stressed that neither the Governors Forum nor Northern Governors had any moral or constitutional jurisdiction to determine the political fate of the South.\n\nThe aspirants queried the alleged selection of only one candidate from South East which had never Produced Nigeria\u2019s President and the picking three from the South West, a zone that has had 16 years at the Presidency and the inclusion of the one from the South South a zone which has also produced a President for six years.\n\nOnu pointed out that the Governors were merely acting based on gratifications being promised to them by a certain Yoruba aspirant from the Southwest, who was also included in the list.\n\nOnu said that five of the northern governors have been promised the office of Vice President, which has suddenly prompted some of the governors to push for the zoning of the All Progressive Congress presidential ticket to the South.\n\nAccording to him, Governors are paying lip service to their reason for zoning the Presidency to the South based on equity and justice, he said that if truly they meant their words , the Southeast must be the considered first for the Presidency and its aspirants subsequently tabled before Buhari to select from .\n\nRallying support for the National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu the Presidential aspirants commended the decisions made so far by the party leadership . The aspirants also held that the party leadership remains the official organ through which decisions are made and adhered to, while urging all stakeholders to galvanise support for the Adamu led executive.\n\nThe statement read ;\n\n\u201cIn the past few hours we have been bombarded with calls and messages from my supporters and concerned Nigerians on a list of five Presidential aspirants submitted to President Buhari to choose from.\n\n\u201cAs long as we are concerned no list has been submitted to Mr. President, the move by the Governors is considered a joke taken to the extreme with the aim of playing with the intellect of Nigerians particularly us from the South-East.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s directive is very simple, that all Presidential aspirants including those from the North should meet and harmonise inorder to produce a single candidate.

They described the massacre of over 50 worshippers at the church during Sunday service as a crime against humanity and a grievous and inexplicable sin.\n\nThe Nigeria Police, yesterday, said they had launched a manhunt for the killers. The police confirmed that the terrorists used AK 47 rifles and explosives in the attack on the church.\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osibanjo, and presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, commiserated with the Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the people of the state, and the Catholic Diocese over the attack.\n\nReacting to the attack, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) asked the federal government to wake up from its slumber and mobilise security agencies to tackle criminal elements causing mayhem across the country head-on.\n\nAn explosion rocked the Catholic Church on Sunday, which was immediately followed by sporadic shootings by gunmen suspected to be terrorists. Over 50 worshippers and passers-by died in the incident, with many more injured.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury wrote in his verified Twitter handle, \u201cThe massacre of worshippers \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 during a Mass in South-west Nigeria was an act of pure evil and a profound offence to God. My prayers are with all affected by this barbaric attack. I continue to pray for the nation of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto\u2019s condemnation of the attack was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the NSCIA Director of Administration, Zubairu Haruna Usman-Ugwu.\n\nThe statement reiterated the Islamic council\u2019s absolute solidarity with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Catholic community and the government and people of Ondo State. The Sultan also commiserated with the families of the victims of the attack, \u201cat this time of immeasurable agony and distress.\u201d\n\nHe tasked all peoples of faith to take the attack on the Catholic Church as a direct attack on all law-abiding citizens, asking them to be in the vanguard of efforts to halt the evil assailing the life, property and integrity of humanity, particularly believers in God.\n\nHe also urged all sub-national governments to issue an ultimatum to the security agencies to unravel the identities of the perpetrators of the violation of sanctity of not only life, but also religion, and bring them to justice.\n\nThe Sultan said in the statement, \u201cThe security agents, who have been engaged to combat criminality and insecurity, are enjoined to heed the Qur\u2019anic call that: \u2026For had it not been that God checks one set of people by means of another; monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the name of God is persistently mentioned would surely have been pulled down.\n\n\u201cVerily, God will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, God is All-Strong, All-Mighty. (Q 22: 40). It is therefore mandatory for security agencies to help in rescuing the helpless citizens that we have all become.\u201d\n\nPolice Launch Manhunt for Killers, as IG Condemns Dastardly Act\n\nThe police high command declared a manhunt for the killers of the worshippers on Sunday in Ondo State. It confirmed that the terrorists deployed AK 47 rifles and explosives in the massacre of the church members. The police also disclosed that they recovered pellets of AK 47 rifles and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at the scene of the mass murder.\n\nA statement from the Force Headquarters said the police recovered pellets of expended AK-47 ammunition and confirmed the use of explosives, as fragments of the IEDs used were found after thorough sweeping of the scene. It said preliminary investigation revealed that some of the gunmen disguised as congregants, while other armed men positioned themselves around the church premises from different directions from where they fired into the church.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, who condemned the act, ordered full-scale investigation into the incident to bring to book the perpetrators.\n\nThe police statement said, \u201cThe Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has condemned in all totality the brutal murder of innocent Nigerians in an attack on St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owaluwa, in Owo, Ondo State. The attack was carried out by yet-to-be-identified gunmen at about 11.30am on Sunday 5th June, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen, from preliminary investigations, invaded the church with arms and materials suspected to be explosives.\n\n\u201cPolice investigators, who were part of the first responders deployed to the scene, have recovered pellets of expended AK-47 ammunition while the Explosive Ordnance Devices \u2013 Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Explosives (EOD-CBRNE) unit \u2013 confirmed the use of explosives as fragments of the IEDs used were found and after thorough sweeping of the scene, three unexploded IEDs were recovered at the scene of the incident.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by Force Public Relations Officer, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), Mr. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, added, \u201cThe assailants fled the scene using a Nissan Sunny car with Reg No. AKR 895 AG, which was snatched from the owner, and escaped through Owo/Ute road. The vehicle has been recovered while the owner of the vehicle is currently assisting the police in its investigations.\n\n\u201cThe IGP has ordered full-scale investigations into the incident in order to bring to book the perpetrators of the gruesome killing of the worshippers at the church.\u201d\n\nThe statement affirmed that the IG also ordered the deployment of specialised operatives of the Police EOD-CBRNE, police experts, and other tactical units from the Force Headquarters for a comprehensive investigation and for immediate interception of the villains.\n\nThe IG, therefore, condoled with Ondo State Government, family members, relatives and friends of those, who lost their lives in the attack.\n\nHe assured that \u201cthe heartless killers of the harmless victims, particularly, innocent children, would be made to face the full wrath of the law while the force will emplace strategies to forestall similar future occurrences,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOsinbajo, Tinubu, Fayemi, Makinde, Amosun Commiserate with Akeredolu, Olowo, NGF Donates N50m to Catholic Diocese\n\nOsibanjo and Tinubu yesterday commiserated with the Ondo State governor, the people of the state, and the Catholic Church over the attack.\n\nOsinbajo, while addressing journalists at the scene of the incident, said, \u201cLet me say that I am completely speechless, looking at the extent of the tragedy that took place here yesterday (Sunday). I think the evil is almost unspeakable and horrible, indeed.\n\n\u201cI think it is just terrible and I\u2019m here on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as well as the government to express our sincere condolences to the church and the people of Owo community and the people of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrible tragedy and I don\u2019t think anyone will wish this to their worst enemies. It is also a time for us to reflect deeply on our relationship with one another.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) also paid a condolence visit to the state.\n\nChairman of NGF and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, visited Akeredolu at the Government House, Akure. Former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, accompanied Fayemi.\n\nFayemi and Amosun were later led by Akeredolu to the residence of the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Bishop Jude Arogundade, before moving to Owo to commiserate with the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye, in his palace.\n\nFayemi, who described the attack as least expected, stated that Owo had been a very peaceful environment.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cIt is a serious and unusual attack on the people who can\u2019t go out and farm or worship God in peace. We are all shocked. Just like the governor said, these people shall not go unpunished. They will be hunted down and brought to book. But this cannot save the lives that have been lost or save the wounded from discomfort.\n\n\u201cAs leaders of the people, we will redouble our efforts. This is happening across the county and we are concerned. We know how troubled you will be. And we know that this is something that troubles our minds.\n\n\u201cFor now, the government at the state and federal levels are working to bring the perpetrators to book. My colleagues in the governors\u2019 forum have asked me to donate N50 million to the Catholic Church to ameliorate the condition of the families of the victims. This is a crime against humanity.\u201d\n\nArogundade described the attack as evil. He urged the governors to ensure that those behind the killing and their sponsors were brought to book.\n\nThe bishop stated, \u201cI appreciate your coming and comments. How did we get here? Have we lost our mind and humanity? Even in war situation, nobody kills children and women. Nobody attacks the church.\n\n\u201cI am calling on you, the leaders of the country, I think we need to talk and we need to be frank with ourselves. This cannot happen without the backing of some powerful people. Those behind this, no matter how powerful they are, must be brought to book.\n\n\u201cHow are we presenting ourselves as primitive. Ondo State doesn\u2019t deserve this; humanity doesn\u2019t deserve this. This doesn\u2019t present us well. People are laughing at us.\u201d\n\nNorthern Governors Condemn Attack\n\nThe Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) condemned the attack on worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church Owo, Ondo State, which over 50 persons dead and others injured.\n\nChairman of the forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, said in a statement signed by his media aide, Simon Macham, that NSGF totally condemned the unprovoked attack on the Church and its worshippers. The statement said the attack was a clear attempt by criminals to instigate religious hatred and inflame passions among Nigerians.\n\nWhile commiserating with the survivors, families of victims, the Catholic Church, and the Christian body in Nigeria, Lalong said the northern governors wanted security agencies to do everything to apprehend the perpetrators, their sponsors, and collaborators. This, he said, would not only ensure that justice was served, but also send a clear message to criminals bent on causing chaos in the country.\n\nThe governor added that the northern governors were in solidarity with their colleague, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, and the government of Ondo State.\n\nMakinde Visits Scene of Attack, FMC Owo\n\nGovernor of Oyo State, \u2018Seyi Makinde, yesterday, visited the church, where worshippers were attacked and killed on Sunday in Ondo State. Makinde, who condoled with the government and people of Ondo State, noted that necessary intelligence must be deployed to prevent a recurrence of such incident.\n\nA statement by Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, said Akeredolu and Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, received Makinde at the premises of the church.\n\nThe statement further said Makinde, who was accompanied by his Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters, Hon. Babatunde Oduyoye, visited the affected church and the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, in company of Akeredolu and Aregbesola.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, where most of the surviving victims with various degrees of injury were receiving treatment, Makinde said the country must be prepared to stop terrorism.\n\nHe added that he was concerned and hoped there was no nexus between the June 5, 2021 attack on Igangan, Oyo State, and that of Owo, Ondo State, on June 5, 2022.\n\nMakinde, who was moved to tears at the sight of an infant casualty with severe injuries, said the attack was unacceptable and highly condemnable.\n\nHe declared that such attacks must never be allowed to recur, calling on all stakeholders to be more prepared and deploy intelligence to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe just saw a baby on the bed there struggling for life. It was a dastardly act. But we have to avoid any knee-jerk reaction. We have to use the intelligence that we have and not just say a particular thing cannot happen. We have to be prepared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound as though this is a regional thing, but as long as it is not acceptable anywhere else, we don\u2019t want to see this kind of thing anywhere in the South-west region of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHunt Down Criminals Responsible for Owo Attack, NLC tells FG\n\nNLC urged the federal government to wake up from its slumber and mobilise security agencies to take full term justice to criminal elements causing mayhem across the country.\n\nIn a statement signed by NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, the congress said government should ensure swift administration of justice to the perpetrators of the dastardly act.\n\nNLC said it was unfortunate and worrisome that barbaric attacks by all shades of criminals across the country were getting bolder and more daring as politicians hustled to occupy public elective positions.\n\n\u201cThis is, indeed, one attack too many,\u201d NLC stated. It said, \u201cOur heart goes out to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this despicable attack.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are also with those who were injured and we wish them very quick recovery and healing from yet another savage and satanic attacks on innocent citizens of our country.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Ondo State government and the federal government to mobilise immediate medical supplies and other care items for victims. We also call for the beefing up of security in public spaces all over the country.\n\n\u201cGovernment must strengthen its intelligence gathering and surveillance mechanisms with the objective of preventing odious crimes of this nature.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that every action \u2013 whether good or bad \u2013 is planned before execution. We also commiserate with the Catholic Church and the Ondo State government for this great loss. Nothing can be more devilish than this.\u201d\n\nCatholic Group Protest in Jos, Says Government Has Failed\n\nThe Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria protested the unwarranted killings of their members in Owo.\n\nAddressing journalists in Jos, National President of Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria, Mr. Henry Yunkwap, lamented that the victims committed no other \u2018crime\u2019 than being Christians, and worshipping their God in church on the day the unfortunate incident occurred.\n\nYunkwap said, \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken and I find it very difficult to address my people at this moment knowing that we are yet to recover from the recent murder of our daughter and friend, the late Deborah Samuel, by some heartless religious extremists in Sokoto State.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making frantic efforts to console our people and also plead with our youths not to take laws in their hands, but to abide by the Bible injunction which admonished us, as Christians, to allow God take vengeance in all circumstances, over 50 innocent worshipers on Sunday, June 5, 2022 at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State were gruesomely murdered by the people we\u2019ve deliberately refused to identify by their names but prefer to use \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 when referring to them. This is uncalled for; this is unacceptable at this time.\u201d\n\nHe warned that every life was sacred, adding that nobody has the right to take life in whatever way, be it under the guise of religion, ethnic or political differences.\n\nYunkwap said, \u201cThe \u2018crime\u2019 committed by those killed were just two; Christians, and secondly, because they were in the church on Sunday worshipping God.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian group and direct mourners of this sad incident, we do not want to only condemn this barbaric act carried out by these animals in human form, but use this medium to let the government know that we have taken enough of this killing of our people and we find it very difficult to chew what is now being forcefully put in our mouth.\n\n\u201cAny government that cannot provide security for her people is indirectly telling them to defend themselves by whatever means. We are, indeed, tired of words; we want action and the urgent arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of this evil act.\n\n\u201cGovernment must rise against just condemning the act by using the over-used words. They must see the life of every Nigerian as very important, not minding where he or she comes from.\u201d\n\nDiri Condoles with Victims\u2019 Families, Akeredolu\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, extended his condolences to the families of victims of the attack. Diri also condoled with his Ondo State counterpart, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and condemned the attack on the worshippers as callous and extremely wicked.\n\nThe Bayelsa State governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, urged the federal government to spare no effort in unravelling the attackers and ensuring they were brought to justice.\n\nThe statement quoted Diri as saying, \u201cThis is another callous and mindless attack on defenceless worshippers. It is of more concern as the perpetrators of the dastardly act went into the temple of worship to desecrate it.\n\n\u201cAll lovers of peace and our country must stand with the victims and families to condemn this very despicable act. I urge the federal government and the security agencies to spare no effort in tracking down the perpetrators and ensure that they face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cWe mourn with families of the victims and pray that the Lord comforts them in this moment of grief. No word is soothing enough to succour them except the solace of the Lord.\n\n\u201cI also commiserate with my brother-governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, over this deeply sad incident. An attack on one in any part of the country is an attack on all of us that love the peace and unity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDiri, who equally condoled with the Catholic Church, said the culprits would face the wrath of God.\n\n\u201cI urge the Catholic Church and, indeed, the Church in Nigeria not to despair because of this attack, but to remain fervent in prayers. All evildoers will definitely have their day of reckoning,\u201d the governor added.\n\nChristian Body Flays Wanton killings in Owo Church, Elsewhere\n\nThe national leadership of Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellowship (NCGF) called on President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle the challenge of insecurity in the country, saying Nigerians could not go to church to worship and feel safe any longer. The national president of NCGF, Professor Chuks Eboka, made the appeal in Benin City, Edo State, while addressing journalists. Eboka expressed sadness over the wanton killings everywhere in Nigeria.\n\nHe said NCGF was traumatised and shocked by Sunday\u2019s killings at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis has happened over and over, with lives of Nigerians being at the mercy of Boko Haram, killer herdsmen, and the so called bandits. We are aggrieved that there no longer exists any safe place in our country.\n\n\u201cNigerians cannot go to church to worship and feel safe: they cannot travel by road and by rail in safety. Innocent lives are being wasted every day.\u201d\n\nThe group also stated, \u201cNigerians have lost faith and trust in the current ruling class, regardless of the parties to which they belong,\u201d after the unrests in parts of the country occasioned by the activities of Boko-Haram, Killer herdsmen, and bandits.\n\nEboka stated, \u201cWe call on President Buhari to urgently arrest this headlong descent into anarchy. We refuse to believe that our military is unable to effectively rein in those who are terrorising our people.\n\n\u201cIf this degeneracy, insecurity and social crisis continue to escalate across the country, the National Assembly should do the needful by invoking the relevant provisions of the constitution to salvage the country.\u201d\n\nThe national president of NCGF also described as vexatious and counterproductive the continued closure of the country\u2019s universities, just as he lamented the alarming poverty index in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the group, as Nigeria heads towards 70 years of independence, there is an urgent need for a return to true federalism and nationalism as was practised in the First Republic. It observed that given all indicators, the present structure was not working and, indeed, could not work.\n\nWe Are All Potential Targets of Terrorists, Says APC Chieftain\n\nA Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Ayodele Arise, SAID with the spate of insecurity in the country, everyone was now a potential terrorist target.\n\nArise, while reacting to the Owo incident, in a statement yesterday, described the sad occurrence as a national calamity. He said there was a need to be resolute in the fight against the insecurity ravaging the country.\n\nArise stated in the condolence message to the governor and people of Ondo State, \u201cPlease, accept my condolences over the gruesome massacre of worshipers in Owo, your hometown. That this could happen anywhere is the dangerous narrative of our time. The callous perpetrators chose to strike in the heart of one of Yoruba heritage and on holy ground.\n\n\u201cWe must be resolute in our quest to fight the gory tragedies of insecurity ravaging our country. This grief is not just for you or Ondo people, it is a national grief that requires all hands on deck to confront the evil minds in our society.\n\n\u201cNigeria must defeat all acts of terrorism. Everybody is a potential victim. We must act decisively and timely. God will grant you the wisdom to console your kith and kin.\u201d\n\nBuhari Overwhelmed by Insecurity, Says Accord Party\n\nNational Legal Adviser of Accord Party, Maxwell Mgbudem, yesterday, said the killing in Ondo State was an indication that Buhari was overwhelmed as the chief security officer of the country.\n\nIn a statement issued in Abuja, to condemn the tragic incident, Mgbudem said there was no doubt that Nigeria was at a crossroads, which he said required concerted effort by every stakeholder to find a lasting solution.\n\nMgbudem said in the statement, \u201cProtection of lives and properties is the primary responsibility of the government. This is clearly stipulated in the 1999 Constitution, so any government that cannot guarantee this has failed in its basic obligation to the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the brazen wastage of innocent souls could only portray that Nigeria was on the way to becoming a failed state, saying this must be reversed immediately, especially given the huge human emergency it will create across West Africa.\n\nMgbudem, who is also National Vice Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), regretted that the security agencies had consistently failed to detect such ugly attacks before they happen. He said the arrogance with which the terrorists carried out their evil acts left much to be desired on the part of the Nigerian security and intelligence community.\n\nHe cautioned that if government failed to take urgent steps to rein in terrorism and their sponsors, the county might be thrown into anarchy due to reprisal killings. This, he said, will ultimately bring the existence of Nigeria to an ugly end.\n\nWhile commiserating with the families and victims of the attack, Mgbudem challenged both the state and federal governments to work in synergy with the security agencies to track down the perpetrators of the act, saying it is one attack too many and cannot be swept under the carpet.\n\nYour Govt in Abuja Has Failed Nigerians, Edo Government Chides APC\n\nSpecial Adviser, Media Projects, to the Edo State Governor, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, upbraided the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its silence on the church massacre in Owo.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide, in a statement, said it was unfortunate that the party in the state had kept mum in the wake of the attack, which had thrown the country into mourning.\n\nOsagie stated, \u201cEdo APC has been uncomfortably mum about the recent attack at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, which has drawn condolences and condemnation from across the country.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Godwin Obaseki embarks on foreign trips to seek investment, Edo APC is quick to throw tantrums. When there is momentary flooding in Benin metropolis, the party and their lackeys go about taking pictures, making bogus claims. But on a very important occasion, such as the Owo attack, they have failed to make a statement to commiserate with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe attack speaks to the failure of the APC at the national level, in Abuja, to take responsibility and face the issue of safety and security squarely. This failing is what Edo APC has refused to acknowledge and draw the attention of its leaders in the executive arm of government to so as to forestall a reoccurrence.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022President wants options reduced further today\n\n\u2022Denies anointing anyone, writes delegates, urges voting without bait\n\n\u2022Controversy trails Lawan\u2019s alleged pick as Adamu shuns govs\n\n\u2022Kalu pushes for senate president, Akeredolu dismisses idea\n\n\u2022Tinubu\u2019s camp insists delegates must decide standard bearer\n\n\u2022Nnamani withdraws from race, Akpanudoedehe quits ruling party\n\n\u2022A\u2019Court stops APC from using statutory delegates at convention\n\n\u2022 Party chair chases journalists out of secretariat\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nAhead of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) special convention and presidential primary today, in Abuja, stakeholders in the party, including the progressive governors, yesterday, reduced the number of aspirants jostling to fly the party\u2019s flag to five in order to properly manage the voting exercise.\n\nFrom the 23 cleared by the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun Screening Committee to contest the presidential primary, the top five in the race now are the Vice-President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi and the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nHowever, not satisfied with the number still in the race, President Muhammadu Buhari, after meeting with governors of the party at a meeting, which started last night and dragged till the early hours of today, directed the governors to further reduce the names to two or three, so it would be a straight fight between those shortlisted to contest.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s nothing close to the United States Super Tuesday, when the greatest number of US states \u2013 about 14 of them \u2013 hold primary elections and caucuses, where approximately one-third of all delegates to the presidential nominating conventions could be won, today\u2019s presidential primary of the ruling APC, is a coincidence, which unfortunately, has birthed more crises than the party leadership had envisaged.\n\nReports earlier yesterday that the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, had endorsed Lawan, unsettled the convention atmosphere, a development, which first precipitated a meeting of the northern governors of the party with President Buhari.\n\nThe president, who immediately issued an official statement to quell tension, however, made public his stand on the choice of a presidential candidate for the APC, saying he had no preference amongst the 23 presidential aspirants.\n\nHe also wrote a letter to the delegates partaking in today\u2019s presidential primary election, and pleaded with them to exercise their rights without allowing any form of inducements or manipulations.\n\nThe APC governors had left a meeting at the party secretariat and headed to another one with the president, armed with five names from the southern presidential aspirants as part of their resolution, in addition to Lawan, a northern aspirant, who has refused to stand down, making the total number of those set for final showdown today six.\n\nGoing through the list, the president directed, albeit in form of advice, that they should prune down the list to two or three, preferably two so it would be a straight fight between the two at the convention today.\n\nBut seeing that the governors seemed uncomfortable with the advice, the president then said if they found it difficult to further prune down the list from the ones shared with him, then, they should let everyone go for an election today.\n\nThe progressives governors are billed to meet again this morning to wrap up their consultations, take a decision and also issue a statement to that effect, after they might have pruned down the list to a manageable number.\n\nYet, an apparently angry Adamu, had avoided a meeting with the governors, where the issues were meant to be looked at collectively and a solution proffered.\n\nRelatedly, Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, has boasted that Adamu would present Lawan to the president today as the consensus option, an idea the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has also dismissed as at best, an opinion of the APC chairman.\n\nBut the camp of one of the presidential hopefuls and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in a statement by Babatunde Ogala and Kehinde Bamigbetan, on behalf of the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation, has warned on the legal impossibility of a consensus and said the delegates must be allowed to determine the choice of the party for presidential candidate.\n\nThis is as a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, has announced his withdrawal from the presidential race in the light of the unsavoury developments, while a former National Secretary of the defunct Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, has quit the party.\n\nHowever, Adamu, apparently unhappy with the reports that exposed his underhand intrigues, yesterday, chased out all the journalists covering activities of the party from the secretariat.\n\nBut before his meeting with the governors late last night, Buhari, at a meeting with the Northern APC governors, State House, Abuja, stated emphatically that he had \u201cno preferred candidate\u201d.\n\nHe also stressed that he had \u201canointed no one,\u201d and was determined to ensure that, \u201cthere shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement by his spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said, the party was important and its members must be respected, and made to feel they were important, stressing that he had a clear mind about what he was doing and asked the APC governors to feel the same way.\n\n\u201cYou were elected as I was. Have a clear mind as I have. God gave us the chance; we have no reason to complain. We must be ready to take pain as we take the joy. Allow the delegates to decide. The party must participate; nobody will appoint anybody,\u201d the president stated.\n\nEarlier, in their addresses, Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State and Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State of the Progressive Governors Forum, said they had come to affirm the position of the Northern Governors that the party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election shall come from the southern part of the country.\n\nThey apologised to the President for the leakage of their signed memorandum, which was not in support of any particular candidate and gave assurances to the president on their readiness to accept his leadership on the matter.\n\nAlso speaking with newsmen, Lalong reiterated the stand taken at the weekend by the APC Northern Governors that power must shift to the South in the presidential primary of the party.\n\nHe said the essence of the meeting with the president was to formally brief him about their stand on power shift and to get the backing of the party\u2019s national leader.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe had a meeting this afternoon with the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our dear President Muhammadu Buhari and this meeting is also in line with part of the consultations that Mr. President had.\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. President had a meeting with us governors and series of people, but at the APC Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, we sat down, we reviewed a lot of things in this country and we discussed at length about the unity of this country, about the need for progress and the need for inclusiveness, and also the need for accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe sat down in the last few days and 13 out of 14 governors agreed. We took a decision to go and advise Mr. President. While we were on our way to advise Mr. President, I think part of the discussions that we had leaked out to the press. Well, we still went ahead and we told Mr. President. Mr. President, being a democrat, said no, he must listen to us, he would listen to us. And so, Mr. President granted the opportunity today.\n\n\u201cOur mission today is to reaffirm our position on that statement. We also apologised to him that that statement was made by all of us and we reaffirmed the position, but we apologised that the statement leaked before even our consultations with him.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is now in the message, not the messenger. So, Mr. President was very happy. He took our position and out of that discussion, Mr. President, as a believer in democratic process, believe that any candidate must emerge through a transparent process and the emphasis that Mr. President told us that for this election, for now, he has no anointed candidate and therefore directed that the Progressive Governors Forum meet with the National Working Committee of the party to agree and proffer further solutions and recommendations for his own succession.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, those of you who read it, I have a copy of what we wrote, which was already out of press, and I said we wrote it and we stand by it; that in the interest of unity, in the interests of peace, we recommended that and also justice, our recommendation is that the next President should come from the south.\n\n\u201cI told you that the President believes in democratic process, but even during democratic process, that are consultations, that are consensus, is also part of democratic process. Even our constitution provides for that; it says consensus and then election, either direct or indirect. So, what we\u2019re doing is part of the build-up towards the election. What we\u2019re also saying is recommendation as we think that will bring out a very peaceful process.\u201d\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, explained that his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, who was also a presidential aspirant asked to be excused from the meeting with the president, because he did not belief in zoning presidency to the South.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe met before coming to meet with Mr. President, we met all of us, including the governor of Kogi State. As you can see, he\u2019s not the only aspirant, the governor of Jigawa State is also an aspirant and he\u2019s here with us and we met. But the governor of Kogi State chose to excuse himself from meeting with Mr. President, because he believes that he does not agree with our position.\n\n\u201cThere are 14 APC governors out of the 19 Northern states. 13 of us are on one page on this subject and we all came to see the President, but the governor of Kogi State excused himself and it is within his democratic rights to excuse himself. But 12 out of 14 is a super majority. 13 out of 14 is an even bigger super majority and the 13 of us met with the President today.\u201d\n\nResponding to question as to if Bello was invited to the meeting, where the Northern APC governors took the decision, El-Rufai confirmed that invitation was duly extended to him but failed to make it to the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe was invited to the meeting, he had a clash, he didn\u2019t make it. Look, I have said this over and over. I don\u2019t know why people assume that when you have 100 people, everyone must agree before a decision can be taken. That is the key to analysis paralysis.\n\n\u201cWhen the majority, or even a super majority, like 12 out of 14, takes a decision, everyone is bound. There is no time that everyone will agree to an issue. It\u2019s part of human nature. But what is the majority view of Northern governors? We represent the majority, indeed a super majority. Also, in any case, his name is not on our list, we didn\u2019t write his name. So even without writing his name, it shows that he was not part of it.\u201d\n\nThe northern APC governors that attended the meeting with the President included Bagudu (Kebbi), Lalong (Plateau), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Abdulrasaq Abdulrahman (Kwara) and Babagana Zulum (Borno).\n\nOthers were Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Bello Matawale (Zamfara), Mallam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Yahaya Inuwa (Gombe), Abubakar Bello (Niger), and the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nBuhari Writes Delegates, Urges Voting Without Inducement\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, wrote to all delegates taking part in picking a presidential standard-bearer for the All Progressives Congress (APC), and urged them to exercise their franchise in an atmosphere devoid of any form of inducement or manipulation.\n\nIn a message signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari, while welcoming the delegates, wrote that, \u201cAs I said when I met with the Progressives Governors Forum, last week, the outcome of this primary election should prove to the world the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\nHe added that the delegates should conduct themselves decently and in order, reiterating that the APC stood for positive change in the way of doing things, \u201cand we must reflect this in all areas of our lives and conduct.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari saluted all delegates, who had traveled from far and near, describing them as \u201cthe true pillars of the party, who have been our strength from formation, to our first electoral victory, the second in 2019, and to the third, by the grace of Almighty Allah, in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe recalled what he told the National Advisory Council at State House on Sunday night, that, \u201cWe are marching towards a third straight victory since 2015, at the Presidential polls.\u201d\n\nTo this end, he urged the delegates to vote wisely, and pick a person that would fly the banner of the party to a resounding victory next year, even as he wished all delegates a happy stay in the Federal Capital Territory, and safe trip when they travel back to their respective destinations.\n\nAdamu Shuns Govs, Kalu Pushes for Lawan, Akeredolu Dismisses Idea\n\nNational Chairman of the APC, Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, shunned a meeting with the governors of the party held at the national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nThis is as Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has expressed confidence that Adamu would present Lawan as the consensus candidate, while the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has dismissed the proposition by his party chairman.\n\nThe meeting scheduled between the governors and Adamu was to discuss the issue of alleged endorsement of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as consensus candidate of the party.\n\nThe governors, who had initially agreed to brief the media on the outcome of the meeting with Adamu and other members of the National Working Committee (NEC) left after an hour as Adamu tactically stayed away.\n\nDeputy National Chairman, North, Senator Abba Kyari, told journalists that the meeting was called in respect of today\u2019s convention, but added that they had not taken a decision on consensus.\n\nAsked about the outcome of the meeting, he said, \u201cAs you are aware, we have a national convention and that is in respect of what is going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe governors, however, left the party secretariat for Adamu\u2019s house located within the precinct of the Presidential Villa.\n\nGovernors, who attended the meeting were Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; Governor of Nasarawa, Abdulahi Sule and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, among others.\n\nAll members of the NWC were at the meeting except Adamu.\n\nMeanwhile, Kalu, in a statement, yesterday, said Lawan was chosen after a thorough evaluation of all the presidential aspirants.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSen Abdulahi Adamu, has through a vigorous evaluation of all our able and qualified candidates, decided in the interest of our party and the future wellbeing of millions of Nigerians, who look to our party for continuous leadership, decided that Senator Ahmed Lawan, is the strongest and\n\nmost suitable candidate to be the flag bearer of our party in the upcoming Presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman and NWC of our party will present Senator Ahmed Lawan to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his endorsement.\u201d\n\nBut Akeredolu has said that Adamu was on a frolic of his own and that he decided to issue a statement, because the speculation about Lawan\u2019s alleged endorsement was rife.\n\n\u201cMy attention has just been drawn to the expensive joke purportedly enacted by the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The speculation is rife that the Chairman took a flight of fancy and decided to make a pronouncement beyond his competence. He has, allegedly, made public his preferred choice as the candidate of the APC for the Office of the President in the next general election.\n\n\u201cThis alleged pronouncement runs contrary to the position of the majority of northern governors in APC and their counterparts in the South. Our agreement is unanimous on this issue.\n\n\u201cThe office of the President should be contested for by qualified persons from the Southern part of the country if the move to get a consensus candidate fails. There has been no shift from this settled issue.\n\n\u201cLet it be known that the Chairman or anyone, who holds a contrary opinion does so at a personal level. He is at best embarking on a frolic, which reasonable people will consider dangerous.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said though his state was grieving, they have not forgotten that power must shift to the\n\nsouth, adding that, \u201con this we stand.\u201d\n\nNWC Disowns Adamu, Insists Lawan Not Consensus Candidate\n\nMembers of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, drew a battle line with the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, over the purported endorsement of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan,as the consensus candidate, a few hours to the party\u2019s presidential primary scheduled for today.\n\nAdamu during the NWC held at the National Secretariat of the party yesterday in Abuja, had allegedly announced Lawan as being chosen as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nHe informed the NWC members that the decision was reached following consultation with President Muhammadu Buhari, who had since denied endorsing Lawan.\n\nNevertheless, the plan by Adamu to seal the fate of other presidential aspirants hit a brick wall when other members of the NWC refused to ratify Lawan as the consensus candidate of the party, a few hours to the party\u2019s convention.\n\nAddressing journalists at the party secretariat after the NWC meeting, the National Organising Secretary, Mr. Suleiman Argungun, said the issue of consensus was never discussed at the meeting, not to talk of endorsing Lawan.\n\nArgungu was in company with the National Vice Chairman, South-south, Chief Victor Giadom, National Vice Chairman, South-west, Isaacs Kekemeke, National Vice Chairman, North-West, and Dr. Salihu Lukman, among other NWC members.\n\nLukman had recently accused Adamu of blackmailing the NWC members with Buhari\u2019s name to force decisions on them.\n\nArgungun, therefore, stated that, \u201cIt is just an information that he (Adamu) gave us. It is not an issue that has to be deliberated by NWC. It is an information. All of us are entitled to our opinion. We are all democrats. This decision was never taken by the NWC.\n\n\u201cThat is just an information, not an issue that was discussed by the NWC. Just recently, the northern governors had their meeting. We, as members of the NWC, are with the governors on what they have said.\u201d\n\nTinubu: Consensus a Legal Impossibility, Let the Delegates Decide\n\nThe campaign organisation of a frontline presidential aspirant of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said the best option for his party in choosing a presidential candidate was to allow the delegates decide, otherwise, consensus remained a legal impossibility.\n\nHe, therefore, insisted that any attempt for a consensus presidential candidate must be in line with Electoral Act, which he claimed was impossible to achieve.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Babatunde Ogala and Kehinde Bamigbetan, who spoke on behalf of the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation.\n\nOgala said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu believes that if there would be any consensus that he is the consensus candidate, if not, let the delegates decide, who will become the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\n\u201cBola Tinubu believes that he has 51 per cent of the delegates as he has the support of the delegates from Lagos, Kano, Katsina, Borno, Cross River Kwarasouth, Oyo and Plateau States.\n\n\u201cIf there would be any consensus, it has to be Bola Tinubu and it must meet the dictates of what the Electoral Act said must be done. All the aspirants must sign to agree, but you know that it is impossible. So, the former governor says that the only option is by allowing the delegates to decide.\u201d\n\nSpeaking too, Kehinde Bamigbetan described as fraudulent, sponsored newspaper advertisement of yesterday, which rated Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo as the candidate to beat, explaining that they were by no means near the reality on ground.\n\nHe said it was not possible for Lagos, Borno, Kano Kaduna and Katsina to vote against Tinubu, when the leadership of these states, had openly identified with Tinubu, stating that the sponsored advertisements were meant to divert attention.\n\nButtressing Ogala\u2019s position, Bamigbetan said the report credited to Adamu that Lawan had been chosen as the consensus candidate was a pure indication of his hate for the north, saying Lawa was not nationally known to stand a chance to defeat the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nHe noted that President Buhari had through one of his media aides, refuted the claims, as well as the APC NWC.\n\nNnamani Withdraws from Race, Akpanudoedehe Quits APC\n\nFormer Senate President, Ken Nnamani, has pulled out of the race to secure the presidential ticket of the APC.\n\nThe former lawmaker announced his withdrawal during a meeting with journalists in Abuja, just as a former National Secretary of the defunct Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, has left the APC.\n\nAccording to Nnamani, he withdrew from the race because he has not had the opportunity to convince delegates on why he deserved the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cMy faith in entering the race is that I will have the opportunity to present my credentials, achievements and ideas for the future of Nigeria. I had anticipated that the NWC would be more definite with plans and completed the screening on time to allow for meaningful consultations and campaigns. But that opportunity never came. The schedules were uncertain even until a few days before primary.\n\n\u201cIn the present circumstances, it does not make any sense for me to continue in the race as I have not had the opportunity to market my profile and ideas to the delegates of our party in a manner that allows for deliberation and introspection.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I discontinue my aspiration and wish the party successful primary and unity of purpose so that we can win the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cI will continue to engage with the party and its leadership to make sure that the ideas and values that I cherish and propagate find strong footing in the party administration and in public leadership after election,\u201d he said\n\nWhile commending APC northern governors for backing power shift to the south, Nnamani said recent events have shown that zoning the office of president to the south-east has been jettisoned.\n\n\u201cThe events of recent days created the impression that zoning had been jettisoned in the APC. The vacillation of party leaders regarding zoning of the APC presidential ticket has not created clarity in the party and injures the confidence and faith of many in the south, particularly, the South-east, in the party.\n\n\u201cIt has the implication of suggesting to many in the party, including myself, that the party will allow conveniences of the moment to override foundational issues of justice and fairness,\u201d he submitted.\n\nOn his part, Akpanudoedehe made his decision known in a letter addressed to the Ward Chairman of Offot Ward 6, Uyo.\n\nHis resignation may not be unconnected to the leadership crisis in the state chapter of the party, where the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, appeared to have edged out Akpanudoedehe, allegedly with the help of the help of the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu.\n\nState Congress of the APC held in October 2021, had recognised Mr. Austin Ekanem as the winner and chairman of the Akwa Ibom APC State Executive. APC conducted State Congresses across the country on 16th October, 2021.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, the Congress conducted by the Seven-member Banki Sheriff-led Election Committee, dispatched by Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee, produced Ekanem as chairman, having won the exercise, polling 1,278 votes.\n\nHowever, in April 2022, Adamu inaugurated Mr. Stephen Ntukekpo as chairman of the party in Akwa Ibom State in defiance to a Court of Appeal order, asking parties to maintain Status quo.\n\nNtukepo is a member of a faction loyal to Akpabio, while Ekanem belongs to the faction loyal to Akpanudoedehe.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, therefore, stated: \u201cI write to notify you of my resignation from the All Progressives\n\nCongress (APC), forthwith.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, I cease to be a member of the APC in my ward (ward 6 in Uyo LGA) or anywhere for that matter. I hereby relinquish all rights, which inured to me as a member of the APC, member of the National Advisory Council and member of National Caucus of the APC.\n\n\u201cThis decision to part ways with the APC, is a tough one, but leadership entails adherence to the wishes of the vast majority of associates, allies and supporters, who have shown fidelity overtime and have now witnessed the obduracy of the APC in handling the candidates selection processes in Akwa Ibom State.\u201d\n\nA\u2019Court Stops APC from Using Statutory Delegates at Convention\n\nThe Court of Appeal, Abuja, has issued an order restraining the National Assembly from imposing statutory delegates at the ongoing convention of the APC.\n\nIn a ruling, yesterday, Justice Haruna Tsammani, also restrained the enforcement of the judgement of a Federal High Court in Kano delivered on June 3, granting the enforcement of amended Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe ex parte application by the National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, was moved by A.A. Popoola and Karma Fagbemi, who pleaded with the appellate court to stay the execution of the judgment of the high court delivered by Justice A.M. Liman in suit number FHC/KN/CS/137/2022 permitting Senator Mas\u2019ud El-Jibrin Doguwa, Hon. Habila Sani, Hon. Bilyaminu Yusuf Shinkafi, the Senate, the Speaker of House of Representatives and the Independent National Electoral Commission to enforce the amendment.\n\nJustice Tsammani further ordered the service of processes of the order by substituted means against the parties in the matter and adjourned hearing of the motion on notice for stay of execution to June 9.\n\nAdamu had contended that the Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act on statutory delegates participation in the primary, which amendment was still pending Mr President\u2019s assent was not in conflict with Section 223 of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 and Article 20(iv) of the APC Constitution.\n\nHe further contended that the suit was filed in Kano on May 24 without joining of the Attorney General of the Federation as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation.\n\nThe party said its Constitution recognised two categories of statutory delegates, being elected and non-elected delegates.\n\nAdamu Chases Journalists Out of APC Secretariat\n\nNational Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, chased journalists covering the activities of the party out of the secretariat.\n\nAdamu\u2019s decision to chase out journalists might not be unconnected to the fallout of the crisis rocking the National Working Committee (NWC) a few hours to the party\u2019s presidential nomination convention.\n\nOne of the security personnel at the party secretariat, told journalists that Adamu was coming back for the NWC meeting and he didn\u2019t want to see anybody at the secretariat, including journalists.\n\n\u201cThe chairman is coming back and he doesn\u2019t want to see anybody, here including journalists,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NWC meeting will still continue following a stalemate over the issue of consensus presidential candidate, ahead of the party\u2019s primary today.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges Nigerians to stand with him in 2023\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate of People Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, took a swipe at the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), when he accused leaders of the ruling party of gathering in Abuja to treat themselves to sumptuous dinner in the name of a meeting, while innocent worshippers died needlessly in Owo, Ondo State.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the Nigerian people to stand with him as volunteers to reclaim the country from the challenges currently befalling it.\n\nAccording to a statement titled: \u201cWhy you need to stand with me at the front\u201d, the former vice president said, it was disconcerting that on the very day, when the whole of the country and the rest of the world was in a sober mood, on account of the massacre in Owo, Ondo State, the ruling APC could not find the moral rectitude to cancel a dinner with their presidential aspirants, slated for the evening of Sunday, 5 June.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say that the so-called primary election is standing on the backdrop of the reported claim of President Muhammadu Buhari to be given an opportunity to handpick his successor.\n\n\u201cWith blood of innocent worshippers flowing on the street of the Sunshine state, leaders of the APC are gathered in Abuja, treating themselves to sumptuous dinner in a manner that suggests lack of empathy to the mood of the nation,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nTo that extent, Atiku said, \u201cSince the convention of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, last weekend, I have continued to enjoy the support and expression of goodwill by party leaders, members and even my co-contestants after the election.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that in my private conversations with these leaders, the PDP is ready to face the next general election as ONE UNITED force.\n\n\u201cAs the presidential flag bearer, my responsibility is not just to ensure that our party returns to power in the presidential election, it is my expectation that I can count on your support to see it through that the PDP wins majority in federal legislative seats, and in all gubernatorial and states\u2019 legislative elections.\n\n\u201cIt is a herculean task, no doubts about it. But, I know that with your support, the PDP can return to the winning ways. You may want to ask what are the implications of the PDP winning the general election?\n\n\u201cVoting for the PDP in the next general election means that you would have done your own part in ensuring that we work together as ONE PEOPLE with ONE FUTURE towards building ONE COUNTRY.\n\n\u201cA PDP victory in 2023 elections means securing our unity as a country and protecting our security and economy, in addition to the enablement of cohesive national development. The other political party will come to you with their usual cocktail of deception.\n\n\u201cBut this is not a time that the country can entertain their empty promises. Their scorecard of failure in the past seven years is the only hard fact that you must continue to show to them whenever they come around. That is the only truth about them: their scorecard of failure!\n\n\u201cBut we cannot reward their failure with an automatic promotion. They have failed us and we must punish them with our votes. With me in the front together with several other leaders of the PDP and with your support, we will get Nigeria back on winning ways.\n\n\u201cBut why stay at the back when you can stand at the front with me in this historic patriotic mission? You can stand with me at the front by signing up as a volunteer in my campaign by opening this link.\n\n\u201cYou may want to tell your friends about the volunteer portal too and together we all get recruited into an army of patriots to reclaim and rescue Nigeria,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe, however, said if the charade that the APC called a presidential convention primary election was merely to handpick an anointed candidate, it was important to ask the managers of the ruling party why they elected to slate the so-called convention for a working day, thereby disrupting economic activities around the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nHis words: \u201cEven as delegates in the so-called election entered into the Federal Capital Territory, they must have been greeted with long queues of vehicles waiting to buy automobile fuel and darkness that continues to grim the capital city on account of seizures in electricity supply.\n\n\u201cShould the APC delegates ask themselves what they have been brought to Abuja for, they should know that primaries of their party is not about any of the individuals vying for the presidential ticket of their party, but a referendum on the APC scorecard in the past 7 years.\n\n\u201cShould the delegates be honest with themselves about the current state of affairs in the country under the watch of their party, they ought to know that allowing the APC to remain in power one more day after May 29, next year is an unpatriotic decision to make.\n\n\u201cFor residents of the FCT, who have been inundated with everyday stress as a result of bad governance by the ruling party, the choice of crucial working days \u2013 Monday and Tuesday \u2013 as days for the primaries of the APC is a callous and insensitive decision.\n\n\u201cIt needs no mention that whoever is \u2018handpicked\u2019 as the APC presidential candidate in such despotic process cannot be any different from the authoritarian fervor of the APC establishment,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2018, the Adamawa State government awarded a contract for the construction of four steel pedestrian bridges, each at a cost of about N67 million.\n\nBased on procurement law and going by available records, the projects ought to have been completed and delivered to the state government the same year. But, SaharaReporters toured the supposed sites and found no such bridge at any location mentioned in the contract document.\n\nFor many residents, the joy of having lifesaving pedestrian bridges at strategic locations in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, was immeasurable as soon as the contracts for the bridges were awarded. The people had a sigh of relief when they learnt of the contracts not knowing it would turn out like the other political gimmicks intended to deceive the unsuspecting and hapless populace.\n\n\n\nAs it turned out, the non-implementation of the contracts has led to loss of lives over the period the contracts were supposed to have been implemented. And the people are wailing.\n\n\n\nAn eyewitness, Abubakar Mahmud, for instance, could not control his tears, watching six ladies knocked down by a moving car along Yola Bypass in the state capital. Four of the six ladies were pronounced dead afterwards at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Yola.\n\n\n\nThe young women met their tragic end while attempting to cross the busy Yola Bypass leading to FMC and the American University of Nigeria (AUN), also in Yola.\n\nMournful Mahmud, who identified one of the deceased as Aisha, his neighbour, said the ladies were returning from a wedding across the road.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had reported the fatal accident which occurred around 6:00 pm local time on June 23, 2021, when Aminu Yar'Adua, son of Nigeria's former president, the late Umar Yar'Adua, knocked down the young women.\n\n\n\nThe young Yar'Adua's identity was confirmed and revealed by the spokesperson for the state Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje. The police said that Aminu Yar\u2019Adua was an off-campus student of the American University of Nigeria in Yola at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\nThe tragic incident, however, was one out of several vehicular knockdowns that have occurred along the road and other spots within the metropolis due to the non-availability of pedestrian bridges.\n\n\n\nJameel Sani, a resident of Shagari Quarters in Yola town lamented the hardship he goes through to cross the Yola Bypass to the main market.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is quite frustrating, crossing this road for me and other pedestrians on a daily basis to attend to our businesses,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMichael Monday, a welder whose workshop is close to Aliyu Musdafa College gate, said, \"Hardly will a day pass by without a car hitting someone around this area.\"\n\n\n\nAt the busy shopping complex gate one, the story is the same.\n\nUsman Senata, a mobile phone seller, said, \u201cWe have no idea whether a pedestrian bridge was to be built at this gate because as you can see there's none.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven at the Jimeta modern market, pedestrians have to meander between moving vehicles to cross the road to get to the market from the other side.\n\n\n\nA trader, Uchenna, Azubuike, said, \u201cWe are pleading with both the government and the contractor to construct the bridge so as to alleviate our suffering.\u201d\n\nAlso at the Yola town market, there is no pedestrian bridge in sight.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that contracts for the construction of four pedestrian bridges were awarded in 2018, but none was built. Documents seen by SaharaReporters show that Shema Synergy and Ngagga Investment Limited won the contracts.\n\nDetails further revealed that Ngagga Investment Limited was awarded two bridges in Yola town, one at Aliyu Musdafa College at the cost of N56 million and the other at the Yola Town Market at the cost of N55 million.\n\n\n\nShema Synergy was awarded the Jimeta Shopping Complex Bridge and Jimeta modern Market Bridge, costing N67 million and N65 million respectively. According to figures posted on Adamawa State Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), N57 million was allegedly disbursed for each of the projects awarded to Shema Synergy, while Ngagga Investment was allegedly paid N55 million and N56 million for the two bridges in Yola town by the immediate past administration of Umar Jibrilla Bindo.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no such bridge in existence or at the very least any sign of workers at any of the four locations mentioned when SaharaReporters visited.\n\n\n\nBased on available procurement documentation, over N200 million was approved for the contracts. But it appears the funds have been diverted into private pockets as none of the contracts was executed.\n\nThe Contractors\n\n\n\nBoth contractors, Shema Synergy Limited and Ngagga Investment Limited admitted the receipt of the contract award documents.\n\nWhen asked to explain why his firm failed to build the bridges, Shema Suleiman said his firm was never mobilized for the projects after the contracts were awarded.\n\n\n\n\"Besides the award letter, I was not mobilised to site. My claim is verifiable from the awarding ministry, the Ministry of Local Government Affairs,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nIt was the same explanation given by Ngagga Investment Limited: \"No mobilization was given.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, the contractors failed to institute legal action as prescribed in the procurement law. A senior officer at the state BPP who spoke on condition of anonymity told our correspondent that by law, a contract is awarded on the condition of 75% availability of the contract sum.\n\n\n\nHe further revealed that the contractors ought to have instituted a legal action against the procurement entity for failing to mobilise them to the sites.\n\n\n\nLocal Government Ministry Officials\n\n\n\nTop management officials of the Minister of Local Government Affairs told our correspondent that they were not in office when the contracts were awarded. The immediate past commissioner in the ministry, Mohammed Umar, as well as the immediate past permanent secretary, Kennedy Dauda, who initially promised to provide details about the contract, failed to do so.\n\n\n\nDauda only informed our reporter that he had contacted one of the contractors, who explained that the project was abandoned due to lack of cash backing.\n\n\n\nBureau Of Procurement\n\n\n\nThe retiring Managing Director of the Bureau of Public Procurement, Abba Bello Umar, also defended the contractors, saying, \"I think there was no cash backing for the contract.\"\n\n\"The bridges were abandoned because the Bindo administration later conceived the idea of building overhead bridges in strategic places within the metropolis,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAsked why the project was uploaded on the bureau's website considering the prevailing circumstances, Umar said: \"It is a normal practice to publish all contract awards, whether executed or not.\"\n\n\n\nWhen our reporter contacted former Governor Bindo, under whose administration the contracts were awarded to speak on the matter, he denied ever conceiving any overhead bridge idea or awarding any such contracts.\n\n\n\n\"It is not true, I couldn't have conceived any such idea, I don't think our immediate priority in Adamawa was overhead bridge. I would have loved to expand the roads to make it a lot easier for motorists and pedestrians,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, some staff members at the BPP hinted that the contract amounts may have been siphoned. An accounting staff member of the Ministry of Local Government Affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that the practice of awarding contracts and not executing them was a \u201cnormal\u201d and familiar one.\n\n\n\n\"Normally, projects are decided upon at joint account meetings involving 21 council chairmen and staff of this ministry. Afterwards, the project goes through the open contract processes and stops at the awarding stage. The money, which is contributed from various local government accounts, is then shared,\u201d the official said.\n\n",

Four of the six ladies were pronounced dead afterwards at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Yola.\n\n\n\nThe young women met their tragic end while attempting to cross the busy Yola Bypass leading to FMC and the American University of Nigeria (AUN), also in Yola.\n\nMournful Mahmud, who identified one of the deceased as Aisha, his neighbour, said the ladies were returning from a wedding across the road.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had reported the fatal accident which occurred around 6:00 pm local time on June 23, 2021, when Aminu Yar'Adua, son of Nigeria's former president, the late Umar Yar'Adua, knocked down the young women.\n\n\n\nThe young Yar'Adua's identity was confirmed and revealed by the spokesperson for the state Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje. The police said that Aminu Yar\u2019Adua was an off-campus student of the American University of Nigeria in Yola at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\nThe tragic incident, however, was one out of several vehicular knockdowns that have occurred along the road and other spots within the metropolis due to the non-availability of pedestrian bridges.\n\n\n\nJameel Sani, a resident of Shagari Quarters in Yola town lamented the hardship he goes through to cross the Yola Bypass to the main market.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is quite frustrating, crossing this road for me and other pedestrians on a daily basis to attend to our businesses,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMichael Monday, a welder whose workshop is close to Aliyu Musdafa College gate, said, \"Hardly will a day pass by without a car hitting someone around this area.\"\n\n\n\nAt the busy shopping complex gate one, the story is the same.\n\nUsman Senata, a mobile phone seller, said, \u201cWe have no idea whether a pedestrian bridge was to be built at this gate because as you can see there's none.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven at the Jimeta modern market, pedestrians have to meander between moving vehicles to cross the road to get to the market from the other side.\n\n\n\nA trader, Uchenna, Azubuike, said, \u201cWe are pleading with both the government and the contractor to construct the bridge so as to alleviate our suffering.\u201d\n\nAlso at the Yola town market, there is no pedestrian bridge in sight.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that contracts for the construction of four pedestrian bridges were awarded in 2018, but none was built. Documents seen by SaharaReporters show that Shema Synergy and Ngagga Investment Limited won the contracts.\n\nDetails further revealed that Ngagga Investment Limited was awarded two bridges in Yola town, one at Aliyu Musdafa College at the cost of N56 million and the other at the Yola Town Market at the cost of N55 million.\n\n\n\nShema Synergy was awarded the Jimeta Shopping Complex Bridge and Jimeta modern Market Bridge, costing N67 million and N65 million respectively. According to figures posted on Adamawa State Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), N57 million was allegedly disbursed for each of the projects awarded to Shema Synergy, while Ngagga Investment was allegedly paid N55 million and N56 million for the two bridges in Yola town by the immediate past administration of Umar Jibrilla Bindo.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no such bridge in existence or at the very least any sign of workers at any of the four locations mentioned when SaharaReporters visited.\n\n\n\nBased on available procurement documentation, over N200 million was approved for the contracts. But it appears the funds have been diverted into private pockets as none of the contracts was executed.\n\nThe Contractors\n\n\n\nBoth contractors, Shema Synergy Limited and Ngagga Investment Limited admitted the receipt of the contract award documents.\n\nWhen asked to explain why his firm failed to build the bridges, Shema Suleiman said his firm was never mobilized for the projects after the contracts were awarded.\n\n\n\n\"Besides the award letter, I was not mobilised to site. My claim is verifiable from the awarding ministry, the Ministry of Local Government Affairs,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nIt was the same explanation given by Ngagga Investment Limited: \"No mobilization was given.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, the contractors failed to institute legal action as prescribed in the procurement law. A senior officer at the state BPP who spoke on condition of anonymity told our correspondent that by law, a contract is awarded on the condition of 75% availability of the contract sum.\n\n\n\nHe further revealed that the contractors ought to have instituted a legal action against the procurement entity for failing to mobilise them to the sites.\n\n\n\nLocal Government Ministry Officials\n\n\n\nTop management officials of the Minister of Local Government Affairs told our correspondent that they were not in office when the contracts were awarded. The immediate past commissioner in the ministry, Mohammed Umar, as well as the immediate past permanent secretary, Kennedy Dauda, who initially promised to provide details about the contract, failed to do so.\n\n\n\nDauda only informed our reporter that he had contacted one of the contractors, who explained that the project was abandoned due to lack of cash backing.\n\n\n\nBureau Of Procurement\n\n\n\nThe retiring Managing Director of the Bureau of Public Procurement, Abba Bello Umar, also defended the contractors, saying, \"I think there was no cash backing for the contract.\"\n\n\"The bridges were abandoned because the Bindo administration later conceived the idea of building overhead bridges in strategic places within the metropolis,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAsked why the project was uploaded on the bureau's website considering the prevailing circumstances, Umar said: \"It is a normal practice to publish all contract awards, whether executed or not.\"\n\n\n\nWhen our reporter contacted former Governor Bindo, under whose administration the contracts were awarded to speak on the matter, he denied ever conceiving any overhead bridge idea or awarding any such contracts.\n\n\n\n\"It is not true, I couldn't have conceived any such idea, I don't think our immediate priority in Adamawa was overhead bridge. I would have loved to expand the roads to make it a lot easier for motorists and pedestrians,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, some staff members at the BPP hinted that the contract amounts may have been siphoned. An accounting staff member of the Ministry of Local Government Affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that the practice of awarding contracts and not executing them was a \u201cnormal\u201d and familiar one.\n\n\n\n\"Normally, projects are decided upon at joint account meetings involving 21 council chairmen and staff of this ministry. Afterwards, the project goes through the open contract processes and stops at the awarding stage. The money, which is contributed from various local government accounts, is then shared,\u201d the official said.\n\n",
          "summary": "In 2018, the Adamawa State government awarded a contract for the construction of four steel pedestrian bridges, each at a cost of about N67 million.\nFor many residents, the joy of having lifesaving pedestrian bridges at strategic locations in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, was immeasurable as soon as the contracts for the bridges were awarded.\nThe tragic incident, however, was one out of several vehicular knockdowns that have occurred along the road and other spots within the metropolis due to the non-availability of pedestrian bridges.\nIt was gathered that contracts for the construction of four pedestrian bridges were awarded in 2018, but none was built.\nShema Synergy was awarded the Jimeta Shopping Complex Bridge and Jimeta modern Market Bridge, costing N67 million and N65 million respectively.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Four rising sectors in Africa's technology ecosystem",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Politicking has reached fever pitch ahead of the presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as the party faces an uphill task of choosing its presidential candidate.\n\nThe indication is that the choice of the 2023 APC presidential candidate will emerge through the ballot at the ongoing national convention.\n\nIntensive lobbying of APC delegates has begun in Abuja as the ruling party prepares to choose its presidential candidate at the Eagle Square on Tuesday. Moves by interest groups asking contenders from the South to drop out of the race for their candidates have made no progress. The support of northern governors for a consensus candidate from the South failed, even before it came into effect, said an APC member in Abuja who spoke on condition anonymity.\n\nNews that Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the APC, announced Ahmad Lawan, president of the Senate, as consensus candidate is a mystery, says a source in Aso Rock. There is no video or statement from the APC chairman. There are, however, conspiracy theories about how the news went viral.\n\nA similar leak, though true, was the news about the northern APC governors\u2019 support for a consensus candidate from the South. The governors apologised to President Muhammadu Buhari for not letting him know before the news was made public. They insist their position remains.\n\nThe Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is said to have held a meeting, with the deputy governor of Kano in attendance, suggesting a split in the state with the most number of delegates.\n\nIn the last 72 hours, President Buhari has intensified efforts to achieve his plans to broker a consensus candidate for the party, holding several meetings \u2013 some open, while some are behind the scene.\n\nIn these meetings, the President did not hide the fact that he has plans to choose his successor.\n\nPresident Buhari said the meetings were convened to provide leadership and direction during the transition period, adding that the motive was \u201cto strengthen our unity and to focus on building upon our electoral fortunes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am optimistic that the outcome of this consultation with the National Advisory Council will, in addition to sharpening our focus, help to fortify the positive democratic principles, practices and culture that already exists within the party system.\n\n\u201cIn the course of these consultative processes, I have already met separately with the Progressive Governors and with all our eminent members who are aspiring to become the presidential flag-bearer for our party during the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe current tension is, however, compounded by the fact that he is yet to unveil the \u201cmasquerade that had received his consequential anointing.\u201d\n\nThe northern governors elected on the platform of the APC narrowed the contest to only the southern aspirants.\n\nThe President has, however, kept his choice to his chest, even as he seeks to push his choice of successor through consensus.\n\nThe President, at one of such meetings, gave aspirants criteria for selecting a consensus candidate before the June 6-8 convention of the party, including that such a candidate must \u201cbe appealing to the electorates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to remind you that our choice of flagbearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also urged the aspirants to look beyond personal ambitions but to \u201cput national and party interest first.\u201d\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, all the APC aspirants were carrying out intense political horse-trading, lobbying the delegates, even as the President continued with his behind-the-scenes consultations over the choice of the party\u2019s candidate, ahead of the convention.\n\nWhile arrangements for the convention are in place, the primary election, according to a programme of events obtained by BusinessDay, will take place on Tuesday (today).\n\nBut as it is, the southern region and APC presidential aspirants from that part of the country are yet to arrive at a consensus, as advised by the party\u2019s hierarchy.\n\nAPC governors and leaders from the North at the weekend conceded the contest to the South and one of the aspirants, Mohammed Abubakar Badaru.\n\nThe APC governors and leaders made their resolution known in a statement after their meeting on Saturday and signed by governors of the party from the region, except Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, who is also aspiring for the position.\n\nThey said: \u201cAfter careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in office of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria. It is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in any way affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\nRead also: Controversy as Adamu unveils Lawan as APC consensus presidential candidate\n\n\u201cWe therefore wish to strongly recommend to President Muhammadu Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC\u2019s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the search for a consensus candidate has continued ahead of the Tuesday\u2019s exercise.\n\nIf the consensus arrangement fails, the party\u2019s 2, 340 ad-hoc delegates would decide the fate of the remaining 13 aspirants seeking the APC presidential ticket.\n\nJohn Odigie-Oyegun, chairman of the APC presidential screening committee when he submitted his report to Adamu, said one of the aspirants was opposed to consensus.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe engage every aspirant on the issue of consensus and it was a pleasant surprise that 99 percent agreed that the party is supreme and whatever the party finally decides with proper consultation they were likely to accept.\n\n\u201cThere is only one person that said \u2018I will accept consensus as long as it is based on me.\u2019 We should not be afraid of the contested primary if anybody insists on the contest.\u201d\n\nUntil the consensus approach is adopted or the President\u2019s choice is unveiled, the horse-trading, lobbying and maneuvering will continue ahead of the primary election.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s major political parties select their presidential candidates for 2023 in a context of insurgency, banditry, terrorism, conflict and killings, what are the worst-case scenarios? Is a united, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria still possible? Will Nigeria retain its sub-optimal mainstream scenario of wavering, drift and dithering? Is a best-case scenario of growth, sustained expansion and shared prosperity a realistic prospect?\u201d Opeyemi Agbaje, founder/chairman of RTC Advisory Services Ltd, asked.",

In alphabetical order, we said Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, John Kayode Fayemi, David Umahi and Professor Yemi Osinbajo. Those are the ones we made recommendations and we said we should put them forward,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cConsensus is possible. Right from yesterday up till today, we have been doing consultations like Mr President said, \u2018I give you the opportunity, work on it.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe governors and the National Working Committee will continue on that consensus. As of yesterday, we were able to even reduce, made recommendations of about five persons, from 23 to recommendations of about 13 aspirants without disqualifying anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin that 13 aspirants that were graded by the Screening Committee, we now looked at it and then recommended, that was jointly done by the Progressive governors and members of the National Working Committee, reducing it to five.\u201d\n\nHe spoke in relation to the resolution of northern APC governors and leaders that power should shift to the south.\n\nThis is against the yesterday\u2019s disclosure by Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman that Senate President Ahmad Lawan is the consensus candidate of the party for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nRead also: APC Presidential primary and the Ides of March in June\n\nAdamu\u2019s claims were roundly rejected by President Muhamadu Buhari and members of the APC National Working Committee.\n\nBuhari at a meeting with northern APC governors denied \u201chaving an anointed candidate\u201d.\n\nA statement by Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the president on media and publicity, revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari, has cleared all doubts about where he stands on the choice of a presidential candidate for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe President declared before the party\u2019s 13 APC\u2019s governors of northern states, that he has \u201cno preferred candidate,\u201d and has \u201canointed no one,\u201d and is determined to ensure that \u201cthere shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, NWC also distanced itself from the purported adoption of Lawan as the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nSulaiman Argungu, APC national organising secretary who journalists at the party\u2019s national secretariat in the company of other NWC members, Argungu said Adamu\u2019s position is contrary to the the party\u2019s stance, which is power shift to the South.\n\nArgungu said: \u201cOur national chairman, distinguished senator Abdullahi Adamu did briefed us that the Senate President, Lawan is the consensus candidate for the APC national convention and that is just for the information he gave us. But it is not an issue that has been discussed on the floor of the NWC.\n\n\u201cJust recently, about two days ago, the northern governors held a meeting that the leadership of this country, under the leadership of the All Progressive Congress should go to the north and equally, the southern governors also affirmed that. So we as members of the NWC are also with the governors on what they have said.\n\n\u201cIs an information and all of us are entitled to our opinion, we are all democrats and we are can exercise whatever. This decision was never taken by the NWC, but an information given to the NWC. It has never been deliberated.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay gathered that APC stakeholders are still exploring the possibility of getting a consensus candidate out of the five recommended aspirants.\n\nThe John Odigie-Oyegun-led screening of the party has screened 23 aspirants for the APC presidential ticket.",

And depending on how the party handles the exercise, it may rub off negatively on the broom association. For some of the aspirants, it promises to be their \u201cIdes of March\u201d in June!\n\nThe leadership of the party had played a mind game with the main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) over where to zone the presidential slot and the choice of candidate.\n\nFollowing the emergence of Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president, who contested against the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari in 2019, the APC knew there was fire on the mountain.\n\nThe party continued to weigh options on who possibly to field to march the national appeal of the Adamawa-born Atiku.\n\nThe search has led to several high level meetings, most of which were nocturnal held inside the womb of Aso Rock and presided over by the President himself. Up till last night, such meetings were still being held.\n\nThere have been lots of intrigues as the President pleaded with the governors on the party\u2019s platform to support him to choose a consensus candidate.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Special Adviser, Media Projects to the Edo State Governor, Mr. Crusoe Osagie has upbraided the state\u2019s chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its deafening silence on the issue of the church massacre in Owo, Ondo State, in which many innocent lives were lost.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide, in a statement, said it was unfortunate that the party in the state has kept mum in the wake of the attack, which has thrown the country into mourning.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEdo APC has been uncomfortably mum about the recent attack at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, which has drawn condolences and condemnation from across the country.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Godwin Obaseki embarks on foreign trips to seek investment, Edo APC is quick to throw tantrums. When there is momentary flooding in Benin metropolis, the party and their lackeys go about taking pictures, making bogus claims. But on a very important occasion such as the Owo attack, they have failed to make a statement to commiserate with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe attack speaks to the failure of the APC at the national level, in Abuja, to take responsibility and face the issue of safety and security squarely. This failing is what Edo APC has refused to acknowledge and draw the attention of its leaders in the executive arm of government to so as to forestall a reoccurrence.\n\n\u201cIt bears repeating that the APC-controlled Federal Government is in charge of all security agencies in the country from the Nigerian Armed Forces, to the Nigeria Police Force, the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigeria Intelligence Agency, the Civil Defense Corps and other paramilitary agencies.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt smacks of hypocrisy, playing the ostrich and irresponsible politicking to shy away from calling attention to the parlous state of our national security architecture, but seek out mundane and pedestrian occasions to lampoon the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\n\u201cThe party should be reminded that their duty as a political party is first of all to Nigerians before selfish, parochial interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdo APC must call their government to order. They have to tell their party to step up measures to ensure that such a sad incident is not repeated in any other part of the country. The government must rise up to the occasion and take responsibility for the task of protecting the lives of Nigerians,\u201d Osagie charged.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Yoruba Global Alliance (YGA), a association of prominent Yoruba in Nigeria and the diaspora, has blamed President Muhammadu Buhari for the horrendous attack on a Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State on Sunday.\n\nGunmen said to be bandits had on Sunday attacked worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, killing an estimated 50 worshippers, while scores of other were injured.\n\nReacting to the massacre in a statement on Monday by Dr. Amos Arogundade Akingba, its national president and High Chief Tola Adeniyi, Chairman of Council, the Yoruba Global Alliance said the incident and the growing insecurity in the country attributed to herders of Fulani origin owes its roots to the invitation of Fulani from across Africa into Nigeria by Buhari.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cThe unprovoked murderous assault on innocent worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo last Sunday by suspected Fulani terrorists in which over 50 lives were gruesomely massacred was certainly off limit.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba Global Alliance along with our allies the Yoruba Global Congress, The Yoruba Unseen and millions of others in the Diaspora, unequivocally hold the Nigerian President General Muhammadu Buhari accountable for the degeneracy of the country\u2019s security architecture which has made incessant killings of innocent peoples all over Nigeria a common and frequent occurrence\n\n\u201cWe recall with anguish Buhari\u2019s invitation, publicly announced in Cairo on December 11 2019, to all Fulani in West Africa to emigrate, albeit, an incursion into Nigeria since no Visas or Passports are required of them, the invitation we considered as totally irresponsible, dangerous and reckless. It was clear to all discerning minds that General Buhari\u2019s invitation was directed at the dregs of the Fulani stock knowing full well that no successful Fulani would leave their places of abode to come to Nigeria. It was people without skills, without jobs, without any means of livelihood that were surreptitiously imported to the country for the Devil to employ. This announcement was made at a time Buhari had shut down all Nigeria land borders to its neighbouring West African states since August of that year!\n\n\u201cWe also hold all the politicians in the land especially Governors, National and State Assembly members and Local Government Chairpersons culpable in the horrendous and gloomy insecurity that has shockingly enveloped the entire Nigeria landscape. Their timidity, sycophancy, selfishness and insensitivity cry to high heavens.\n\n\u201cThe systemic murders in Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Plateau, Benue, Taraba, Kogi, Igbo land, Ijaw land, and Yoruba land will not stop unless and until the politicians elected by the people are courageous enough to challenge the Commander-in-Chief of Nigeria\u2019s Armed Forces and pointedly put it to his face that the buck stops at his desk. There is no better time than now to pass a vote of no confidence in this President , consider impeaching him, though a tall order or ask him to step down due to his inability to curb the incessant killings by these foreign Fulani marauders he had invited to pollute and terrorize the country. We want to remind these politicians that the good action they refuse to take today due to their enjoyment of security details, will haunt them in the future after they have finished transient terms. This was the similar fate that had become the fate of many in the past and in recent times.\u201d\n\nThe alliance expressed discomfort with what it called President Buhari\u2019s continued opposition to the creation of state police, while warning the attackers to stay off Yorubaland.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that from all available records President Buhari is the only person blocking the creation of State police in the country. The mayhem in Owo could not have happened that brazenly if Ondo state had a well-equipped State Police,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cPampered and Condoned Terrorists let loose on Nigeria space could be having their field day as a revenge on the forces that created them, they should never again bring their untamed madness to Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba, because of our level of civilization and sophistication are very slow to anger, very accommodating and forgiving, very rational and philosophical, but are definitely not stupid or cowardly. Let the notice go out there that the Yoruba do not joke with blood and land; these two items are held sacred. The blood will always avenge itself and Ile Ogere Af\u2019oko Ye\u2019ri swallows its traducers. Those taunting the Yoruba should take heed. They should read their history books. They should ask about the sacred Iroko Oluwere. They should understand that no one has monopoly of violence. They should remember the Agbekoya riots.\n\n\u201cYoruba Global Alliance hereby calls on the Ooni of Ife, The Sultan of Sokoto, the Shehu of Bornu, the Awujale of Ijebu, the Tor Tiv, the Obong of Calabar, the Obi of Onitsha, the Oba of Benin, the Etsu Nupe, the Aku Uka of Wukari, the Olowo of Owo and Olubadan of Ibadan to immediately summon top Government political/military functionaries, including Mr. President as well as past Heads of State to a Roundtable and resolve the insecurity menace in the country before Nigeria descends into irreversible dungeon.\n\n\u201cThe Monarchs as the traditional and natural leaders of their communities must begin to assert their annointed positions and recognize politicians, from Councilor to President, as our SERVANTS. Political leaders were elected by the people to SERVE the people and should not be allowed through sycophancy to turn themselves to \u2018Lord and Master\u2019 which usually is the beginning and enabler of Dictatorship, Tyranny and Absolutism.

Certainly, this is not the time for election jamboree, or preparing for Population Census or the mirage of Restructuring or dubious Constitution Amendment. What should be uppermost now is how to de-amalgamate the country\u2019s unworkable marriage and let Indigenous Nationalities artificially and forcibly yoked together go their separate ways.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate that the ancient Kingdom of Owo is too important to the United Yoruba Kingdoms [UYK] as the birthplace of our modern political evolution and should never again be stained by the blood-thirsty messengers of Hell.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba Global Alliance while condoling with the peaceful people of Owo and the Ondo state government has declared a 7-Day mourning period for our departed Yoruba Nation compatriots.\n\n\u201cMay the innocent lives rudely and fiendishly terminated avenge their animalistic termination.\u201d",

This will enhance the profile of the country as a foremost facilitator of trade, an important global development practice, in line with the requirements of the World Customs Organisation (WCO)\u201d it stated.\n\nThe Concessionaire and its technical and financial partners will invest a total of $3.2 billion to fully automate the Nigeria Customs Service, in Phase. In essence, the federal government will pay nothing to the concessionaire and its partners.\n\nfrom 2022 to 2025.

Clarifying this, the Managing Director, Dr. Jummai Umar-Ajijola said that this is a conservative estimate.\u201d\n\nNigeria began implementation of WCO guidelines on Customs automation, but the current system deployed has now become a legacy system, that requires total overhaul, to meet new demands of the Nigeria Customs Service.\n\nNigeria Customs Service has said that the project will require that all its personnel become computer literate and this is a major aspect of the project. The capacity building aspect of the project, will include comprehensive training of Nigeria Customs personnel in technology adoption and deployment, including becoming certified programmers for the successful running of the project when the Concessionaire hands over.\n\nThe Customs modernisation projects are being implemented around the world as part of efforts to harmonize global trade regimes and simplify trading across borders. Many countries are complying with WCO requirements and standards and if Nigeria is to benefit from global trade expansion, the country must move in tandem with the rest of the world.\n\nThe statement said the project has the major advantage of ensuring significant growth in the revenue profile of the federal government. The project will generate in excess of $176 billion to the federal government over the life of the concession.\n\n\u201cThe project will bring Nigeria at par with the rest of the word in the deployment of technology to facilitate international trade. The economic diversification activities of the Federal Government will receive a strong boost by providing further ease of cross-border trading,\u201d it stated.",

Bola Tinubu to achieve its dream in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe Chairman of the chapter, Mr. Bola Babarinde, said this in a statement on Tuesday in Lagos while throwing weight behind the presidential ambition of Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State.\n\nBabarinde said that Tinubu had demonstrated such a feat as governor of Lagos State in laying the foundation for its economic development.\n\nAccording to him, this is evident in the strides achieved by Lagos State in becoming the 5th largest economy in Africa.\n\nDecrying the alleged economic damage by the former ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Babarinde said that rebuilding was always a process that requires patience and time\n\n\u201cWhat the PDP destroyed for 16 years cannot be repaired and rebuilt within eight years.\n\n\u201cTo fasten the recovery and advancement of development as possible, we need an economic and political genius to achieve that; we find that in the person and genius of Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201dHe has demonstrated such feat as Governor of Lagos State in laying the foundation for its economic development and is evident in strides achieved by Lagos becoming the 5th largest economy in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria remains at this level because of a lack of innovation from successive administrations to reform and diversify Nigeria\u2019s monolithic economy.\n\n\u201cOur over-dependency on oil as major revenue has been an albatross, not only on the economy but on social cohesiveness as it has created lopsided economic dependency and reliance,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu has the magic wand to turn around Nigeria\u2019s economy and improve internal and external revenue generation.\n\nHe said that Tinubu had done so before against all odds \u201cwhen PDP-under Obasanjo starved Lagos State of allocations for three years and in his characteristically genius manner survived and thrived.\n\n\u201cBola Tinubu is the only one in the contest presently that can defeat Atiku (PDP presidential candidate) because of his overwhelming national political structure, his detribalized nature that has endeared him to all tribes and religious inclinations.\n\n\u201cHe is a Muslim whose wife is a Christian Pastor and he has demonstrated the accommodating nature and tolerance needed to lead a diverse and multi-ethnic nation like Nigeria without bias for political or primordial sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe hereby undoubtedly endorse Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu as the flag bearer of our party, All Progressives Congress,\u201d Babarinde said.",

          "title": "APC special convention: Buhari drops crucial hint as Northern APC governors, 7 NWC members disown Adamu on Lawan",
          "text": "As the All Progressives Congress (APC) began its presidential primaries Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari has cleared all doubts about where he stands on the choice of a presidential candidate for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe president spoke before the party\u2019s 14 governors of northern states that he has \u201cno preferred candidate,\u201d and has \u201canointed no one,\u201d and determined to ensure \u201cthere shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the meeting held at the State House Abuja, President Buhari said the party is important and its members must be respected and made to feel they are important.\n\nThe president\u2019s position came against the backdrop of media reports that the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu announced Monday that the party had agreed on Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan as its consensus presidential candidate.\n\nHe was reported to have said this during the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting at the party secretariat in Abuja.\n\nThe position ran contrary to that by the northern governors that power should shift to the South in 2023.\n\nThe said announcement, however, generated reactions with some applauding while others rejected the move.\n\nBuhari declares\n\nBut clearing the air on the controversies generated by the said comment, President Buhari said he had a clear mind about what he was doing and asked the APC governors to feel the same way.\n\n\u201cYou were elected as I was. Have a clear mind as I have. God gave us the chance; we have no reason to complain.\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to take pain as we take the joy. Allow the delegates to decide. The Party must participate, nobody will appoint anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in their addresses, Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and Plateau state Governor Simon Bako Lalong, and Chairman Progressive Governors Forum/Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu said they came to the Villa to affirm the position of the northern governors that the party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election shall come from the southern part of the country.\n\nThey apologised to the president for the leakage of their signed memorandum which was not in support of any particular candidate and assured him of their readiness to accept his leadership on the matter.\n\nSpecifically, Governor Bagudu said the northern governors believed their support for power shift to the South was good for the unity of the nation, fairness and justice.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the totality of the issues in our country and we believe APC with a President that has delivered democratic dividends across the breadth of the country and 22 Governors, has everything going for it.\n\n\u201cWhat is the political brinkmanship that we need to bring so that every component of Nigeria will feel important? It is to allow opportunity for other parts of the country. And this is a step that will bring more peace and resonate with every part of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Governor Nasiru el-Rufai of Kaduna state said out of the 14 APC governors in the north, only Yahaya Bello of Kogi state, who is also an aspirant, disagreed with their position.\n\nNWC divided over Lawan\n\nIn a related development, the NWC members are sharply divided over the controversial endorsement of Lawan as consensus candidate.\n\nReacting to the development, a group of the NWC members led by the National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Suleiman Abubakar Argungu, totally rejected Adamu\u2019s position, even as he described it as \u201chis personal opinion.\u201d\n\nApart from Argungu, other NWC members at the news conference which took place at the party\u2019s national secretariat include: National Vice Chairman North-west, National Vice Chairman North-central, National Vice Chairman South-south, National Vice Chairman South-west, two other deputies among others.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the national officers, Argungu said: \u201cThis decision was never taken by the NWC, but an information given to the NWC. It has never been deliberated.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether his group was rejecting Senator Adamu\u2019s consensus announcement, Argungu said: \u201cYou see it\u2019s just an information he (Adamu) gave us, and it\u2019s not an issue that has to be deliberated on the floor of the NWC. It is an information and all of us are entitled to our opinion, we are all democrats and we can exercise it.\n\n\u201cAbout two days ago, the APC Northern Governors had a meeting that the leadership of this country, under the All Progressives Congress should go to the South. And equally, the Southern governors also affirmed that.\n\n\u201cSo, we as members of the NWC are also with the governors on what they have said and some minutes ago, the Northern governors have gone to the President and have just briefed the president that they are still on what they said with regards to the power shift to the south.\u201d\n\nTinubu dismisses consensus again\n\nMeanwhile, one of the presidential aspirants and former Lagos state Governor Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said consensus arrangement to elect the party\u2019s flag bearer was not feasible.\n\nHe said a unilateral declaration by the party\u2019s national chairman, would not only violate the law, but set the party on collision cause with its governors who were critical stakeholders in the party.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Director Legal Directorate Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Babatunde Ogala, the APC national leader described the development as a legal impossibility.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to state that such a declaration is a legal impossibility. This is because the under the regime of the Electoral Act 2022, consensus, though provided for as one of the means by which a political party may produce its candidate, must specifically occur in a precise form.\n\n\u201cSection 84(9) (10) and (11) of the Electoral Act 2022 are the relevant provisions and they state as follows:\n\n\u201c(9) A political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirant for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\n\n\u201c(10) Where a political party is unable to secure a written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective position.\n\n\u201c(11) A special convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the National, State, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies, as the case may be\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstructively, none of the above conditions have occurred in respect of producing the presidential candidate of the APC. Therefore, any declaration of a consensus candidate would be premature and a violation of extant provisions of the law. We are confident that as a law-abiding entity, the APC will not be part of such.\n\n\u201cWe are further persuaded to urge our supporters to disregard this report considering that the overwhelming majority of the APC Northern Governors who, after meeting with the President, re-affirmed their preference for a president from the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis patriotic decision is widely accepted by all Nigerians as a demonstration of deep understanding of the nuanced fault lines of our nation.\u201d\n\nSolidarity rally for Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osimbajo staged solidarity March across Abuja Monday to sell the VP\u2019s candidature as a presidential material to Nigerians.\n\nThe exercise titled \u2018Joint March in Support of Osinbajo in 2023\u2019, commenced from his Campaign office at Buchanan Crescent, opposite Aguiyi Ironsi street, Wuse II Abuja, to the Wuse Central Market and proceeded to Unity Fountain in the heart of Abuja.\n\nVarious groups rooting for the VP as Buhari\u2019s successor participated in the march, with the aim to create awareness among Nigerians that it is only Osinbajo who can restore Nigeria to her glorious days.\n\nSpeaking after the march, Director General of Osinbajo Campaign, Senator Kabir Gaya, who hails from Kano state, elaborated on the purpose of the event, saying \u201cthey have hope that Osibanjo will win the 2023 Presidential election.\u201d\n\nHe said the purpose was to bring the well-wishers and all support groups together to promote the candidate.\n\nSenator Gaya also said that from their experience during visit to the states to meet with party delegates, it was clear the VP had an overwhelming support base, adding that \u201che is loved by many who are confident that he will emerge victorious in the APC presidential primaries.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that youths and elders were excitedly behind the Osinbajo, Gaya said \u201cthere is need for the delegates and the party to consider the person who is already part of the system, rather than voting those who will start afresh and begin to look for files.\u201d\n\nGaya also recalled how Osinbajo performed above board when the President was away, saying that alone was enough reason to back him for President.\n\nHe said no government is perfect across the world, adding that Osinbajo has seen where President Buhari made mistakes and where he achieved success, hence he would consolidate in areas of success and rejig areas of failure.\n\nIn her remarks, organiser of the event, Hajiya Rabi Dauda, expressed confidence that the Vice President would defeat other aspirants to clinch the APC ticket in the ongoing presidential primary election in Abuja.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

It is a continuous process and i believe even at the dying minute we can succeed in doing that. They are all credible aspirants and they are people of honour and we will continue to discuss with them until we succeed.\n\n\u201cZoning is a gentleman\u2019s agreement, and we believe our APC leaders are gentlemen and gentlewomen. That is how we came up with this recommendation, which we conveyed to Mr President, and I am pleased that he has agreed to it\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Governor stated that convincing party members to have power zoned to the South has not been easy but given the facts on the ground, as well as personal experiences, he believes zoning should be respected, and that it should be the turn of the Southern aspirant.\n\nGanduje further added \u201cWe worked extremely hard to save the northern politicians\u2019 niche, particularly those in the APC, as well as to maintain peace and stability. This is a hard fact, But this is not the first time, such thing happened. When the NPN decided to zone the presidency to the Northern part of the country in 1979, a mini convention was held in Kaduna, and I, as a young graduate and politician, took part in the selection of six presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cWe chose six people, including our great president, Shehu Shagari of blessed memory, Maitam Sule of blessed memory, Adamu Ciroma of blessed memory, Takar from Benue, Sola Saraki of blessed memory, and the former vice chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, and presented them to the National Convention in Lagos, where Shagari was elected. You can see that zoning is not a new concept; zoning is a gentleman\u2019s agreement, so there is nothing new to persuade our colleagues to support this resolution. We are pleased that Mr. President has accepted it\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/06/buhari-will-adopt-nobody-but-tinubu-shettima/",

They also face accusations of money laundering in India, where tax officials raided properties belonging to them in 2018 in multiple cities, including their company office in capital Delhi.\n\nMany of the most serious corruption allegations levelled against the Indian-born brothers focus on their relationship with Jacob Zuma, who was president of South Africa from 2009 until he was forced to step down amid a storm of corruption allegations nine years later.\n\nThe Gupta family is accused of using their close links with Mr Zuma to wield enormous political power across all levels of South African government \u2013 winning business contracts, influencing high-profile government appointments and misappropriating state funds.\n\nMr Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.\n\nAfter the brothers fled the country, South Africa negotiated an extradition treaty with the UAE in 2021.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s government has said it hoped the agreement would lead to the return of the Guptas to face charges, but it was not immediately clear following the arrests whether the brothers will return to South Africa.\n\nThe Gupta family became so closely linked with Mr Zuma that a joint term was even coined for them \u2013 the Zuptas.\n\nOne of Mr Zuma\u2019s wives, as well as a son and daughter, had positions working in senior roles for Gupta-controlled companies.\n\nMany of the companies in the Gupta portfolio profited from lucrative contracts with government departments and state-owned corporations \u2013 where public officials say they were directly instructed by the family to take decisions that would advance the brothers\u2019 business interests.\n\nIt is alleged that compliance was rewarded with money and promotion, while disobedience was punished with dismissal.\n\nThe list of public bodies accused of having been \u201ccaptured\u201d is extensive \u2013 the ministries of finance, natural resources and public enterprises, as well as agencies responsible for tax collection and communications, the state broadcaster SABC, the national carrier, South African Airways, the state-owned rail-freight operator and the energy giant Eskom \u2013 one of the largest utility companies on the planet.\n\nA four-year investigation later published by the country\u2019s top judge concluded that the wealthy brothers had become deeply embedded in the highest levels of government and Mr Zuma\u2019s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party.\n\nReports published this year by investigators accuse the brothers of being linked to racketeering activity through the procurement of rail, ports and pipeline infrastructure.\n\nIts authors also concluded that Mr Zuma \u201cwould do anything that the Guptas wanted him to do for them\u201d.\n\nLast year Mr Zuma was imprisoned for 15 months for refusing to testify before the same investigators. He was released on parole after serving two months of his sentence in jail.\n\nWho are the Gupta brothers?\n\nAjay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta moved to South Africa from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 1993, just after the fall of apartheid.\n\nIt is said that when Atul arrived to set up the family business Sahara Computers, he was amazed by the lack of red tape.\n\nThey grew the company to employ more than 10,000 people in South Africa, also developing financial interests in the mining, air travel, energy, technology and media sectors.\n\nAtul Gupta said he met Mr Zuma before he became president \u201cwhen he was a guest in one of Sahara\u2019s annual functions\u201d.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "\u2018Let the Delegates Decide\u2019: Osinbajo, Tinubu, Fayemi, Amaechi, Umahi, Lawan Battle for APC Presidential Ticket \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Ahead of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) special convention and presidential primary on Tuesday, in Abuja, stakeholders in the party, including the progressive governors, Monday, reduced the number of aspirants jostling to fly the party\u2019s flag to five in order to properly manage the voting exercise.\n\nFrom the 23 cleared by the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun Screening Committee to contest the presidential primary, the top six in the race now are the Vice-President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi and the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nHowever, not satisfied with the number still in the race, President Muhammadu Buhari, after meeting with governors of the party at a meeting, which started Monday night and dragged till the early hours of Tuesday, directed the governors to further reduce the names to two or three, so it would be a straight fight between those shortlisted to contest.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s nothing close to the United States Super Tuesday, when the greatest number of US states \u2013 about 14 of them \u2013 hold primary elections and caucuses, where approximately one-third of all delegates to the presidential nominating conventions could be won, Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary of the ruling APC, is a coincidence, which unfortunately, has birthed more crises than the party leadership had envisaged.\n\nReports earlier Tuesday that the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, had endorsed Lawan, unsettled the convention atmosphere, a development, which first precipitated a meeting of the northern governors of the party with President Buhari.\n\nThe president, who immediately issued an official statement to quell tension, however, made public his stand on the choice of a presidential candidate for the APC, saying he had no preference amongst the 23 presidential aspirants.\n\nHe also wrote a letter to the delegates partaking in Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary election, and pleaded with them to exercise their rights without allowing any form of inducements or manipulations.\n\nThe APC governors had left a meeting at the party secretariat and headed to another one with the president, armed with five names from the southern presidential aspirants as part of their resolution, in addition to Lawan, a northern aspirant, who has refused to stand down, making the total number of those set for final showdown to six.\n\nGoing through the list, the president directed, albeit in form of advice, that they should prune down the list to two or three, preferably two so it would be a straight fight between the two at the convention today.\n\nBut seeing that the governors seemed uncomfortable with the advice, the president then said if they found it difficult to further prune down the list from the ones shared with him, then, they should let everyone go for an election.\n\nThe progressives governors are billed to meet again Tuesday morning to wrap up their consultations, take a decision and also issue a statement to that effect, after they might have pruned down the list to a manageable number.\n\nYet, an apparently angry Adamu, had avoided a meeting with the governors, where the issues were meant to be looked at collectively and a solution proffered.\n\nRelatedly, Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, has boasted that Adamu would present Lawan to the president on Tuesday as the consensus option, an idea the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has also dismissed as at best, an opinion of the APC chairman.\n\nBut the camp of one of the presidential hopefuls and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in a statement by Babatunde Ogala and Kehinde Bamigbetan, on behalf of the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation, has warned on the legal impossibility of a consensus and said the delegates must be allowed to determine the choice of the party for presidential candidate.\n\nThis is as a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, has announced his withdrawal from the presidential race in the light of the unsavoury developments, while a former National Secretary of the defunct Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, has quit the party.\n\nHowever, Adamu, apparently unhappy with the reports that exposed his underhand intrigues, on Monday, chased out all the journalists covering activities of the party from the secretariat.\n\nBut before his meeting with the governors late Monday night, Buhari, at a meeting with the Northern APC governors, State House, Abuja, stated emphatically that he had \u201cno preferred candidate\u201d.\n\nHe also stressed that he had \u201canointed no one,\u201d and was determined to ensure that, \u201cthere shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement by his spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said, the party was important and its members must be respected, and made to feel they were important, stressing that he had a clear mind about what he was doing and asked the APC governors to feel the same way.\n\n\u201cYou were elected as I was. Have a clear mind as I have. God gave us the chance; we have no reason to complain. We must be ready to take pain as we take the joy. Allow the delegates to decide. The party must participate; nobody will appoint anybody,\u201d the president stated.\n\nEarlier, in their addresses, Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State and Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State of the Progressive Governors Forum, said they had come to affirm the position of the Northern Governors that the party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election shall come from the southern part of the country.\n\nThey apologised to the President for the leakage of their signed memorandum, which was not in support of any particular candidate and gave assurances to the president on their readiness to accept his leadership on the matter.\n\nAlso speaking with newsmen, Lalong reiterated the stand taken at the weekend by the APC Northern Governors that power must shift to the South in the presidential primary of the party.\n\nHe said the essence of the meeting with the president was to formally brief him about their stand on power shift and to get the backing of the party\u2019s national leader.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe had a meeting this afternoon with the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our dear President Muhammadu Buhari and this meeting is also in line with part of the consultations that Mr. President had.\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. President had a meeting with us governors and series of people, but at the APC Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, we sat down, we reviewed a lot of things in this country and we discussed at length about the unity of this country, about the need for progress and the need for inclusiveness, and also the need for accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe sat down in the last few days and 13 out of 14 governors agreed. We took a decision to go and advise Mr. President. While we were on our way to advise Mr. President, I think part of the discussions that we had leaked out to the press. Well, we still went ahead and we told Mr. President. Mr. President, being a democrat, said no, he must listen to us, he would listen to us. And so, Mr. President granted the opportunity today.\n\n\u201cOur mission today is to reaffirm our position on that statement. We also apologised to him that that statement was made by all of us and we reaffirmed the position, but we apologised that the statement leaked before even our consultations with him.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is now in the message, not the messenger. So, Mr. President was very happy. He took our position and out of that discussion, Mr. President, as a believer in democratic process, believe that any candidate must emerge through a transparent process and the emphasis that Mr. President told us that for this election, for now, he has no anointed candidate and therefore directed that the Progressive Governors Forum meet with the National Working Committee of the party to agree and proffer further solutions and recommendations for his own succession.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, those of you who read it, I have a copy of what we wrote, which was already out of press, and I said we wrote it and we stand by it; that in the interest of unity, in the interests of peace, we recommended that and also justice, our recommendation is that the next President should come from the south.\n\n\u201cI told you that the President believes in democratic process, but even during democratic process, that are consultations, that are consensus, is also part of democratic process. Even our constitution provides for that; it says consensus and then election, either direct or indirect. So, what we\u2019re doing is part of the build-up towards the election. What we\u2019re also saying is recommendation as we think that will bring out a very peaceful process.\u201d\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, explained that his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, who was also a presidential aspirant asked to be excused from the meeting with the president, because he did not believe in zoning presidency to the South.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe met before coming to meet with Mr. President, we met all of us, including the governor of Kogi State. As you can see, he\u2019s not the only aspirant, the governor of Jigawa State is also an aspirant and he\u2019s here with us and we met. But the governor of Kogi State chose to excuse himself from meeting with Mr. President, because he believes that he does not agree with our position.\n\n\u201cThere are 14 APC governors out of the 19 Northern states. 13 of us are on one page on this subject and we all came to see the President, but the governor of Kogi State excused himself and it is within his democratic rights to excuse himself. But 12 out of 14 is a super majority. 13 out of 14 is an even bigger super majority and the 13 of us met with the President today.\u201d\n\nResponding to question as to if Bello was invited to the meeting, where the Northern APC governors took the decision, El-Rufai confirmed that invitation was duly extended to him but failed to make it to the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe was invited to the meeting, he had a clash, he didn\u2019t make it. Look, I have said this over and over. I don\u2019t know why people assume that when you have 100 people, everyone must agree before a decision can be taken. That is the key to analysis paralysis.\n\n\u201cWhen the majority, or even a super majority, like 12 out of 14, takes a decision, everyone is bound. There is no time that everyone will agree to an issue. It\u2019s part of human nature. But what is the majority view of Northern governors? We represent the majority, indeed a super majority. Also, in any case, his name is not on our list, we didn\u2019t write his name. So even without writing his name, it shows that he was not part of it.\u201d\n\nThe northern APC governors that attended the meeting with the President included Bagudu (Kebbi), Lalong (Plateau), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Abdulrasaq Abdulrahman (Kwara) and Babagana Zulum (Borno).\n\nOthers were Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Bello Matawale (Zamfara), Mallam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Yahaya Inuwa (Gombe), Abubakar Bello (Niger), and the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nBuhari Writes Delegates, Urges Voting Without Inducement\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, wrote to all delegates taking part in picking a presidential standard-bearer for the All Progressives Congress (APC), and urged them to exercise their franchise in an atmosphere devoid of any form of inducement or manipulation.\n\nIn a message signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari, while welcoming the delegates, wrote that, \u201cAs I said when I met with the Progressives Governors Forum, last week, the outcome of this primary election should prove to the world the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\nHe added that the delegates should conduct themselves decently and in order, reiterating that the APC stood for positive change in the way of doing things, \u201cand we must reflect this in all areas of our lives and conduct.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari saluted all delegates, who had traveled from far and near, describing them as \u201cthe true pillars of the party, who have been our strength from formation, to our first electoral victory, the second in 2019, and to the third, by the grace of Almighty Allah, in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe recalled what he told the National Advisory Council at State House on Sunday night, that, \u201cWe are marching towards a third straight victory since 2015, at the Presidential polls.\u201d\n\nTo this end, he urged the delegates to vote wisely, and pick a person that would fly the banner of the party to a resounding victory next year, even as he wished all delegates a happy stay in the Federal Capital Territory, and safe trip when they travel back to their respective destinations.\n\nAdamu Shuns Govs, Kalu Pushes for Lawan, Akeredolu Dismisses Idea\n\nNational Chairman of the APC, Abdulahi Adamu, on Monday, shunned a meeting with the governors of the party held at the national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nThis is as Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has expressed confidence that Adamu would present Lawan as the consensus candidate, while the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has dismissed the proposition by his party chairman.\n\nThe meeting scheduled between the governors and Adamu was to discuss the issue of alleged endorsement of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as consensus candidate of the party.\n\nThe governors, who had initially agreed to brief the media on the outcome of the meeting with Adamu and other members of the National Working Committee (NEC) left after an hour as Adamu tactically stayed away.\n\nDeputy National Chairman, North, Senator Abba Kyari, told journalists that the meeting was called in respect of today\u2019s convention, but added that they had not taken a decision on consensus.\n\nAsked about the outcome of the meeting, he said, \u201cAs you are aware, we have a national convention and that is in respect of what is going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe governors, however, left the party secretariat for Adamu\u2019s house located within the precinct of the Presidential Villa.\n\nGovernors, who attended the meeting were Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; Governor of Nasarawa, Abdulahi Sule and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, among others.\n\nAll members of the NWC were at the meeting except Adamu.\n\nMeanwhile, Kalu, in a statement, on Monday, said Lawan was chosen after a thorough evaluation of all the presidential aspirants.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSen Abdulahi Adamu, has through a vigorous evaluation of all our able and qualified candidates, decided in the interest of our party and the future wellbeing of millions of Nigerians, who look to our party for continuous leadership, decided that Senator Ahmed Lawan, is the strongest and\n\nmost suitable candidate to be the flag bearer of our party in the upcoming Presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman and NWC of our party will present Senator Ahmed Lawan to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his endorsement.\u201d\n\nBut Akeredolu has said that Adamu was on a frolic of his own and that he decided to issue a statement, because the speculation about Lawan\u2019s alleged endorsement was rife.\n\n\u201cMy attention has just been drawn to the expensive joke purportedly enacted by the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The speculation is rife that the Chairman took a flight of fancy and decided to make a pronouncement beyond his competence. He has, allegedly, made public his preferred choice as the candidate of the APC for the Office of the President in the next general election.\n\n\u201cThis alleged pronouncement runs contrary to the position of the majority of northern governors in APC and their counterparts in the South. Our agreement is unanimous on this issue.\n\n\u201cThe office of the President should be contested for by qualified persons from the Southern part of the country if the move to get a consensus candidate fails. There has been no shift from this settled issue.\n\n\u201cLet it be known that the Chairman or anyone, who holds a contrary opinion does so at a personal level. He is at best embarking on a frolic, which reasonable people will consider dangerous.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said though his state was grieving, they have not forgotten that power must shift to the\n\nsouth, adding that, \u201con this we stand.\u201d\n\nNWC Disowns Adamu, Insists Lawan Not Consensus Candidate\n\nMembers of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Monday, drew a battle line with the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, over the purported endorsement of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan,as the consensus candidate, a few hours to the party\u2019s presidential primary scheduled for today.\n\nAdamu during the NWC held at the National Secretariat of the party yesterday in Abuja, had allegedly announced Lawan as being chosen as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nHe informed the NWC members that the decision was reached following consultation with President Muhammadu Buhari, who had since denied endorsing Lawan.\n\nNevertheless, the plan by Adamu to seal the fate of other presidential aspirants hit a brick wall when other members of the NWC refused to ratify Lawan as the consensus candidate of the party, a few hours to the party\u2019s convention.\n\nAddressing journalists at the party secretariat after the NWC meeting, the National Organising Secretary, Mr. Suleiman Argungun, said the issue of consensus was never discussed at the meeting, not to talk of endorsing Lawan.\n\nArgungu was in company with the National Vice Chairman, South-south, Chief Victor Giadom, National Vice Chairman, South-west, Isaacs Kekemeke, National Vice Chairman, North-West, and Dr. Salihu Lukman, among other NWC members.\n\nLukman had recently accused Adamu of blackmailing the NWC members with Buhari\u2019s name to force decisions on them.\n\nArgungun, therefore, stated that, \u201cIt is just an information that he (Adamu) gave us. It is not an issue that has to be deliberated by NWC. It is an information. All of us are entitled to our opinion. We are all democrats. This decision was never taken by the NWC.\n\n\u201cThat is just an information, not an issue that was discussed by the NWC. Just recently, the northern governors had their meeting. We, as members of the NWC, are with the governors on what they have said.\u201d\n\nTinubu: Consensus a Legal Impossibility, Let the Delegates Decide\n\nThe campaign organisation of a frontline presidential aspirant of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said the best option for his party in choosing a presidential candidate was to allow the delegates decide, otherwise, consensus remained a legal impossibility.\n\nHe, therefore, insisted that any attempt for a consensus presidential candidate must be in line with Electoral Act, which he claimed was impossible to achieve.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Babatunde Ogala and Kehinde Bamigbetan, who spoke on behalf of the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation.\n\nOgala said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu believes that if there would be any consensus that he is the consensus candidate, if not, let the delegates decide, who will become the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\n\u201cBola Tinubu believes that he has 51 per cent of the delegates as he has the support of the delegates from Lagos, Kano, Katsina, Borno, Cross River Kwarasouth, Oyo and Plateau States.\n\n\u201cIf there would be any consensus, it has to be Bola Tinubu and it must meet the dictates of what the Electoral Act said must be done. All the aspirants must sign to agree, but you know that it is impossible. So, the former governor says that the only option is by allowing the delegates to decide.\u201d\n\nSpeaking too, Kehinde Bamigbetan described as fraudulent, sponsored newspaper advertisement of yesterday, which rated Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo as the candidate to beat, explaining that they were by no means near the reality on ground.\n\nHe said it was not possible for Lagos, Borno, Kano Kaduna and Katsina to vote against Tinubu, when the leadership of these states, had openly identified with Tinubu, stating that the sponsored advertisements were meant to divert attention.\n\nButtressing Ogala\u2019s position, Bamigbetan said the report credited to Adamu that Lawan had been chosen as the consensus candidate was a pure indication of his hate for the north, saying Lawa was not nationally known to stand a chance to defeat the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nHe noted that President Buhari had through one of his media aides, refuted the claims, as well as the APC NWC.",
          "summary": "Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi and the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan.\n\u201cThere are 14 APC governors out of the 19 Northern states.\nGovernors, who attended the meeting were Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; Governor of Nasarawa, Abdulahi Sule and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, among others.\nHe, therefore, insisted that any attempt for a consensus presidential candidate must be in line with Electoral Act, which he claimed was impossible to achieve.\nOgala said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu believes that if there would be any consensus that he is the consensus candidate, if not, let the delegates decide, who will become the presidential candidate of the APC.",

          "text": "The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, on Monday, joined the growing number of individuals and groups that have condemned Sunday\u2019s heinous attack on St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. They described the massacre of over 50 worshippers at the church during Sunday service as a crime against humanity and a grievous and inexplicable sin.\n\nThe Nigeria Police, on Monday, said they had launched a manhunt for the killers. The police confirmed that the terrorists used AK 47 rifles and explosives in the attack on the church.\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osibanjo, and presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, commiserated with the Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the people of the state, and the Catholic Diocese over the attack.\n\nReacting to the attack, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) asked the federal government to wake up from its slumber and mobilise security agencies to tackle criminal elements causing mayhem across the country head-on.\n\nAn explosion rocked the Catholic Church on Sunday, which was immediately followed by sporadic shootings by gunmen suspected to be terrorists. Over 50 worshippers and passers-by died in the incident, with many more injured.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury wrote in his verified Twitter handle, \u201cThe massacre of worshippers \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 during a Mass in South-west Nigeria was an act of pure evil and a profound offence to God. My prayers are with all affected by this barbaric attack. I continue to pray for the nation of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto\u2019s condemnation of the attack was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the NSCIA Director of Administration, Zubairu Haruna Usman-Ugwu.\n\nThe statement reiterated the Islamic council\u2019s absolute solidarity with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Catholic community and the government and people of Ondo State. The Sultan also commiserated with the families of the victims of the attack, \u201cat this time of immeasurable agony and distress.\u201d\n\nHe tasked all peoples of faith to take the attack on the Catholic Church as a direct attack on all law-abiding citizens, asking them to be in the vanguard of efforts to halt the evil assailing the life, property and integrity of humanity, particularly believers in God.\n\nHe also urged all sub-national governments to issue an ultimatum to the security agencies to unravel the identities of the perpetrators of the violation of sanctity of not only life, but also religion, and bring them to justice.\n\nThe Sultan said in the statement, \u201cThe security agents, who have been engaged to combat criminality and insecurity, are enjoined to heed the Qur\u2019anic call that: \u2026For had it not been that God checks one set of people by means of another; monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the name of God is persistently mentioned would surely have been pulled down.\n\n\u201cVerily, God will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, God is All-Strong, All-Mighty. (Q 22: 40). It is therefore mandatory for security agencies to help in rescuing the helpless citizens that we have all become.\u201d\n\nPolice Launch Manhunt for Killers, as IG Condemns Dastardly Act\n\nThe police high command declared a manhunt for the killers of the worshippers on Sunday in Ondo State. It confirmed that the terrorists deployed AK 47 rifles and explosives in the massacre of the church members. The police also disclosed that they recovered pellets of AK 47 rifles and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at the scene of the mass murder.\n\nA statement from the Force Headquarters said the police recovered pellets of expended AK-47 ammunition and confirmed the use of explosives, as fragments of the IEDs used were found after thorough sweeping of the scene. It said preliminary investigation revealed that some of the gunmen disguised as congregants, while other armed men positioned themselves around the church premises from different directions from where they fired into the church.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, who condemned the act, ordered full-scale investigation into the incident to bring to book the perpetrators.\n\nThe police statement said, \u201cThe Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has condemned in all totality the brutal murder of innocent Nigerians in an attack on St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owaluwa, in Owo, Ondo State. The attack was carried out by yet-to-be-identified gunmen at about 11.30am on Sunday 5th June, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen, from preliminary investigations, invaded the church with arms and materials suspected to be explosives.\n\n\u201cPolice investigators, who were part of the first responders deployed to the scene, have recovered pellets of expended AK-47 ammunition while the Explosive Ordnance Devices \u2013 Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Explosives (EOD-CBRNE) unit \u2013 confirmed the use of explosives as fragments of the IEDs used were found and after thorough sweeping of the scene, three unexploded IEDs were recovered at the scene of the incident.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by Force Public Relations Officer, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), Mr. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, added, \u201cThe assailants fled the scene using a Nissan Sunny car with Reg No. AKR 895 AG, which was snatched from the owner, and escaped through Owo/Ute road. The vehicle has been recovered while the owner of the vehicle is currently assisting the police in its investigations.\n\n\u201cThe IGP has ordered full-scale investigations into the incident in order to bring to book the perpetrators of the gruesome killing of the worshippers at the church.\u201d\n\nThe statement affirmed that the IG also ordered the deployment of specialised operatives of the Police EOD-CBRNE, police experts, and other tactical units from the Force Headquarters for a comprehensive investigation and for immediate interception of the villains.\n\nThe IG, therefore, condoled with Ondo State Government, family members, relatives and friends of those, who lost their lives in the attack.\n\nHe assured that \u201cthe heartless killers of the harmless victims, particularly, innocent children, would be made to face the full wrath of the law while the force will emplace strategies to forestall similar future occurrences,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOsinbajo, Tinubu, Fayemi, Makinde, Amosun Commiserate with Akeredolu, Olowo, NGF Donates N50m to Catholic Diocese\n\nOsibanjo and Tinubu on Monday commiserated with the Ondo State governor, the people of the state, and the Catholic Church over the attack.\n\nOsinbajo, while addressing journalists at the scene of the incident, said, \u201cLet me say that I am completely speechless, looking at the extent of the tragedy that took place here yesterday (Sunday). I think the evil is almost unspeakable and horrible, indeed.\n\n\u201cI think it is just terrible and I\u2019m here on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as well as the government to express our sincere condolences to the church and the people of Owo community and the people of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrible tragedy and I don\u2019t think anyone will wish this to their worst enemies. It is also a time for us to reflect deeply on our relationship with one another.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) also paid a condolence visit to the state.\n\nChairman of NGF and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, visited Akeredolu at the Government House, Akure. Former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, accompanied Fayemi.\n\nFayemi and Amosun were later led by Akeredolu to the residence of the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Bishop Jude Arogundade, before moving to Owo to commiserate with the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye, in his palace.\n\nFayemi, who described the attack as least expected, stated that Owo had been a very peaceful environment.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cIt is a serious and unusual attack on the people who can\u2019t go out and farm or worship God in peace. We are all shocked. Just like the governor said, these people shall not go unpunished. They will be hunted down and brought to book. But this cannot save the lives that have been lost or save the wounded from discomfort.\n\n\u201cAs leaders of the people, we will redouble our efforts. This is happening across the county and we are concerned. We know how troubled you will be. And we know that this is something that troubles our minds.\n\n\u201cFor now, the government at the state and federal levels are working to bring the perpetrators to book. My colleagues in the governors\u2019 forum have asked me to donate N50 million to the Catholic Church to ameliorate the condition of the families of the victims. This is a crime against humanity.\u201d\n\nArogundade described the attack as evil. He urged the governors to ensure that those behind the killing and their sponsors were brought to book.\n\nThe bishop stated, \u201cI appreciate your coming and comments. How did we get here? Have we lost our mind and humanity? Even in war situation, nobody kills children and women. Nobody attacks the church.\n\n\u201cI am calling on you, the leaders of the country, I think we need to talk and we need to be frank with ourselves. This cannot happen without the backing of some powerful people. Those behind this, no matter how powerful they are, must be brought to book.\n\n\u201cHow are we presenting ourselves as primitive. Ondo State doesn\u2019t deserve this; humanity doesn\u2019t deserve this. This doesn\u2019t present us well. People are laughing at us.\u201d\n\nNorthern Governors Condemn Attack\n\nThe Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) condemned the attack on worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church Owo, Ondo State, which over 50 persons dead and others injured.\n\nChairman of the forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, said in a statement signed by his media aide, Simon Macham, that NSGF totally condemned the unprovoked attack on the Church and its worshippers. The statement said the attack was a clear attempt by criminals to instigate religious hatred and inflame passions among Nigerians.\n\nWhile commiserating with the survivors, families of victims, the Catholic Church, and the Christian body in Nigeria, Lalong said the northern governors wanted security agencies to do everything to apprehend the perpetrators, their sponsors, and collaborators. This, he said, would not only ensure that justice was served, but also send a clear message to criminals bent on causing chaos in the country.\n\nThe governor added that the northern governors were in solidarity with their colleague, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, and the government of Ondo State.\n\nMakinde Visits Scene of Attack, FMC Owo\n\nGovernor of Oyo State, \u2018Seyi Makinde, yesterday, visited the church, where worshippers were attacked and killed on Sunday in Ondo State. Makinde, who condoled with the government and people of Ondo State, noted that necessary intelligence must be deployed to prevent a recurrence of such incident.\n\nA statement by Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, said Akeredolu and Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, received Makinde at the premises of the church.\n\nThe statement further said Makinde, who was accompanied by his Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters, Hon. Babatunde Oduyoye, visited the affected church and the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, in company of Akeredolu and Aregbesola.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, where most of the surviving victims with various degrees of injury were receiving treatment, Makinde said the country must be prepared to stop terrorism.\n\nHe added that he was concerned and hoped there was no nexus between the June 5, 2021 attack on Igangan, Oyo State, and that of Owo, Ondo State, on June 5, 2022.\n\nMakinde, who was moved to tears at the sight of an infant casualty with severe injuries, said the attack was unacceptable and highly condemnable.\n\nHe declared that such attacks must never be allowed to recur, calling on all stakeholders to be more prepared and deploy intelligence to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe just saw a baby on the bed there struggling for life. It was a dastardly act. But we have to avoid any knee-jerk reaction. We have to use the intelligence that we have and not just say a particular thing cannot happen. We have to be prepared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound as though this is a regional thing, but as long as it is not acceptable anywhere else, we don\u2019t want to see this kind of thing anywhere in the South-west region of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHunt Down Criminals Responsible for Owo Attack, NLC tells FG\n\nNLC urged the federal government to wake up from its slumber and mobilise security agencies to take full term justice to criminal elements causing mayhem across the country.\n\nIn a statement signed by NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, the congress said government should ensure swift administration of justice to the perpetrators of the dastardly act.\n\nNLC said it was unfortunate and worrisome that barbaric attacks by all shades of criminals across the country were getting bolder and more daring as politicians hustled to occupy public elective positions.\n\n\u201cThis is, indeed, one attack too many,\u201d NLC stated. It said, \u201cOur heart goes out to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this despicable attack.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are also with those who were injured and we wish them very quick recovery and healing from yet another savage and satanic attacks on innocent citizens of our country.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Ondo State government and the federal government to mobilise immediate medical supplies and other care items for victims. We also call for the beefing up of security in public spaces all over the country.\n\n\u201cGovernment must strengthen its intelligence gathering and surveillance mechanisms with the objective of preventing odious crimes of this nature.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that every action \u2013 whether good or bad \u2013 is planned before execution. We also commiserate with the Catholic Church and the Ondo State government for this great loss. Nothing can be more devilish than this.\u201d\n\nCatholic Group Protest in Jos, Says Government Has Failed\n\nThe Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria protested the unwarranted killings of their members in Owo.\n\nAddressing journalists in Jos, National President of Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria, Mr. Henry Yunkwap, lamented that the victims committed no other \u2018crime\u2019 than being Christians, and worshipping their God in church on the day the unfortunate incident occurred.\n\nYunkwap said, \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken and I find it very difficult to address my people at this moment knowing that we are yet to recover from the recent murder of our daughter and friend, the late Deborah Samuel, by some heartless religious extremists in Sokoto State.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making frantic efforts to console our people and also plead with our youths not to take laws in their hands, but to abide by the Bible injunction which admonished us, as Christians, to allow God take vengeance in all circumstances, over 50 innocent worshipers on Sunday, June 5, 2022 at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State were gruesomely murdered by the people we\u2019ve deliberately refused to identify by their names but prefer to use \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 when referring to them. This is uncalled for; this is unacceptable at this time.\u201d\n\nHe warned that every life was sacred, adding that nobody has the right to take life in whatever way, be it under the guise of religion, ethnic or political differences.\n\nYunkwap said, \u201cThe \u2018crime\u2019 committed by those killed were just two; Christians, and secondly, because they were in the church on Sunday worshipping God.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian group and direct mourners of this sad incident, we do not want to only condemn this barbaric act carried out by these animals in human form, but use this medium to let the government know that we have taken enough of this killing of our people and we find it very difficult to chew what is now being forcefully put in our mouth.\n\n\u201cAny government that cannot provide security for her people is indirectly telling them to defend themselves by whatever means. We are, indeed, tired of words; we want action and the urgent arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of this evil act.\n\n\u201cGovernment must rise against just condemning the act by using the over-used words. They must see the life of every Nigerian as very important, not minding where he or she comes from.\u201d\n\nDiri Condoles with Victims\u2019 Families, Akeredolu\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, extended his condolences to the families of victims of the attack. Diri also condoled with his Ondo State counterpart, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and condemned the attack on the worshippers as callous and extremely wicked.\n\nThe Bayelsa State governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, urged the federal government to spare no effort in unravelling the attackers and ensuring they were brought to justice.\n\nThe statement quoted Diri as saying, \u201cThis is another callous and mindless attack on defenceless worshippers. It is of more concern as the perpetrators of the dastardly act went into the temple of worship to desecrate it.\n\n\u201cAll lovers of peace and our country must stand with the victims and families to condemn this very despicable act. I urge the federal government and the security agencies to spare no effort in tracking down the perpetrators and ensure that they face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cWe mourn with families of the victims and pray that the Lord comforts them in this moment of grief. No word is soothing enough to succour them except the solace of the Lord.\n\n\u201cI also commiserate with my brother-governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, over this deeply sad incident. An attack on one in any part of the country is an attack on all of us that love the peace and unity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDiri, who equally condoled with the Catholic Church, said the culprits would face the wrath of God.\n\n\u201cI urge the Catholic Church and, indeed, the Church in Nigeria not to despair because of this attack, but to remain fervent in prayers. All evildoers will definitely have their day of reckoning,\u201d the governor added.\n\nChristian Body Flays Wanton killings in Owo Church, Elsewhere\n\nThe national leadership of Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellowship (NCGF) called on President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle the challenge of insecurity in the country, saying Nigerians could not go to church to worship and feel safe any longer. The national president of NCGF, Professor Chuks Eboka, made the appeal in Benin City, Edo State, while addressing journalists. Eboka expressed sadness over the wanton killings everywhere in Nigeria.\n\nHe said NCGF was traumatised and shocked by Sunday\u2019s killings at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis has happened over and over, with lives of Nigerians being at the mercy of Boko Haram, killer herdsmen, and the so called bandits. We are aggrieved that there no longer exists any safe place in our country.\n\n\u201cNigerians cannot go to church to worship and feel safe: they cannot travel by road and by rail in safety. Innocent lives are being wasted every day.\u201d\n\nThe group also stated, \u201cNigerians have lost faith and trust in the current ruling class, regardless of the parties to which they belong,\u201d after the unrests in parts of the country occasioned by the activities of Boko-Haram, Killer herdsmen, and bandits.\n\nEboka stated, \u201cWe call on President Buhari to urgently arrest this headlong descent into anarchy. We refuse to believe that our military is unable to effectively rein in those who are terrorising our people.\n\n\u201cIf this degeneracy, insecurity and social crisis continue to escalate across the country, the National Assembly should do the needful by invoking the relevant provisions of the constitution to salvage the country.\u201d\n\nThe national president of NCGF also described as vexatious and counterproductive the continued closure of the country\u2019s universities, just as he lamented the alarming poverty index in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the group, as Nigeria heads towards 70 years of independence, there is an urgent need for a return to true federalism and nationalism as was practised in the First Republic. It observed that given all indicators, the present structure was not working and, indeed, could not work.\n\nWe Are All Potential Targets of Terrorists, Says APC Chieftain\n\nA Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Ayodele Arise, SAID with the spate of insecurity in the country, everyone was now a potential terrorist target.\n\nArise, while reacting to the Owo incident, in a statement yesterday, described the sad occurrence as a national calamity. He said there was a need to be resolute in the fight against the insecurity ravaging the country.\n\nArise stated in the condolence message to the governor and people of Ondo State, \u201cPlease, accept my condolences over the gruesome massacre of worshipers in Owo, your hometown. That this could happen anywhere is the dangerous narrative of our time. The callous perpetrators chose to strike in the heart of one of Yoruba heritage and on holy ground.\n\n\u201cWe must be resolute in our quest to fight the gory tragedies of insecurity ravaging our country. This grief is not just for you or Ondo people, it is a national grief that requires all hands on deck to confront the evil minds in our society.\n\n\u201cNigeria must defeat all acts of terrorism. Everybody is a potential victim. We must act decisively and timely. God will grant you the wisdom to console your kith and kin.\u201d\n\nBuhari Overwhelmed by Insecurity, Says Accord Party\n\nNational Legal Adviser of Accord Party, Maxwell Mgbudem, yesterday, said the killing in Ondo State was an indication that Buhari was overwhelmed as the chief security officer of the country.\n\nIn a statement issued in Abuja, to condemn the tragic incident, Mgbudem said there was no doubt that Nigeria was at a crossroads, which he said required concerted effort by every stakeholder to find a lasting solution.\n\nMgbudem said in the statement, \u201cProtection of lives and properties is the primary responsibility of the government. This is clearly stipulated in the 1999 Constitution, so any government that cannot guarantee this has failed in its basic obligation to the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the brazen wastage of innocent souls could only portray that Nigeria was on the way to becoming a failed state, saying this must be reversed immediately, especially given the huge human emergency it will create across West Africa.\n\nMgbudem, who is also National Vice Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), regretted that the security agencies had consistently failed to detect such ugly attacks before they happen. He said the arrogance with which the terrorists carried out their evil acts left much to be desired on the part of the Nigerian security and intelligence community.\n\nHe cautioned that if government failed to take urgent steps to rein in terrorism and their sponsors, the county might be thrown into anarchy due to reprisal killings. This, he said, will ultimately bring the existence of Nigeria to an ugly end.\n\nWhile commiserating with the families and victims of the attack, Mgbudem challenged both the state and federal governments to work in synergy with the security agencies to track down the perpetrators of the act, saying it is one attack too many and cannot be swept under the carpet.\n\nYour Govt in Abuja Has Failed Nigerians, Edo Government Chides APC\n\nSpecial Adviser, Media Projects, to the Edo State Governor, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, upbraided the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its silence on the church massacre in Owo.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide, in a statement, said it was unfortunate that the party in the state had kept mum in the wake of the attack, which had thrown the country into mourning.\n\nOsagie stated, \u201cEdo APC has been uncomfortably mum about the recent attack at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, which has drawn condolences and condemnation from across the country.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Godwin Obaseki embarks on foreign trips to seek investment, Edo APC is quick to throw tantrums. When there is momentary flooding in Benin metropolis, the party and their lackeys go about taking pictures, making bogus claims. But on a very important occasion, such as the Owo attack, they have failed to make a statement to commiserate with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe attack speaks to the failure of the APC at the national level, in Abuja, to take responsibility and face the issue of safety and security squarely. This failing is what Edo APC has refused to acknowledge and draw the attention of its leaders in the executive arm of government to so as to forestall a reoccurrence.\u201d",
          "summary": "An explosion rocked the Catholic Church on Sunday, which was immediately followed by sporadic shootings by gunmen suspected to be terrorists.\nChairman of NGF and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, visited Akeredolu at the Government House, Akure.\n\u201cWe urge the Ondo State government and the federal government to mobilise immediate medical supplies and other care items for victims.\nWe also commiserate with the Catholic Church and the Ondo State government for this great loss.\nHe said NCGF was traumatised and shocked by Sunday\u2019s killings at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo.",

          "title": "Elon Musk Threatens to Walk Away from Twitter Deal Over Fake Accounts",
          "text": "Elon Musk is threatening to walk away from his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter, accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts.\n\nLawyers for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO made the threat in a letter to Twitter dated Monday that the company disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe lawyers wrote that Musk has repeatedly asked for the information since May 9, about a month after his offer to buy the company, so he could evaluate how many of the company\u2019s 229 million accounts are fake.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal has said that Twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5% of its accounts are spam. But Musk has disputed that, contending in a May tweet, without providing evidence, that 20% or more are bogus.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. slid 1.5% Monday, likely incensing Twitter shareholders who filed a suit against Musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock. Shares of Twitter are down more than 20% in the last month.\n\nTwitter said in a statement Monday that it has been cooperatively sharing information with Musk \u201cin accordance with the terms of the merger agreement\u201d and noted that the deal is in \u201cthe best interest of all shareholders.\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,\u201d it added.\n\nMusk agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share back in April. A number of Musk\u2019s actions since, including a public spat with Twitter\u2019s CEO about the fake accounts \u2014 on Twitter \u2014 has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to use his loud complaints to negotiate a lower deal price or even walk away entirely.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyers wrote in the letter that Twitter has offered only to provide details about the company\u2019s testing methods. But they contend that\u2019s \u201ctantamount to refusing Mr. Musk\u2019s data requests,\u201d and constitutes a \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of the merger agreement that gives Musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear material breach of Twitter\u2019s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,\u201d the letter says.\n\nMusk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are Twitter\u2019s lax methodologies.\n\nThe Twitter sale agreement allows Musk to get out of the deal if there is a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d caused by the company. It defines that as a change that negatively affects Twitter\u2019s business or financial conditions. Twitter has said all along that it\u2019s proceeding with the deal, although it hasn\u2019t scheduled a shareholder vote on it.\n\nLast month Musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold, which experts said he can\u2019t do. If he walks away, he could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee.\n\nMusk\u2019s latest maneuver shows how he is \u201clooking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price,\u201d said Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College. But Quinn said it\u2019s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence.\n\n\u201cI doubt he would be allowed to walk away,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAt some point, the board of Twitter will tire of this and file a suit\u201d asking a judge to force Musk to stick to the deal.\n\nTwitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for years, while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low.\n\n\u201cIf Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company\u2019s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates,\u201d the Musk letter says, adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data.\n\nThe bot problem is a longtime fixation for Musk, who has more than 96 million Twitter followers and whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams. Musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other Twitter users, as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyers are arguing that he is entitled to data about the core of Twitter\u2019s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership. Citing a June 1 letter from Twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale, Musk\u2019s team says the company is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal.\n\nMusk\u2019s bot count skepticism was also taken up Monday by the chief legal officer of Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said he\u2019s launching an investigation because he has a \u201cduty to protect Texans if Twitter is misrepresenting how many accounts are fake to drive up their revenue.\u201d",
