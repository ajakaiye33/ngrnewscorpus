          "title": "Why parents should worry about children bedwetting again after six months \u2013Paediatrician",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Paediatrician, Nephrology Division at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina, Dr. Abdurrazzaq Alege, says parents should be worried if a child that has previously attained bladder control for more than six months suddenly starts bedwetting without any obvious sickness.\n\nAlege said although stress is a common cause of bedwetting in children, physical, emotional and sexual abuse or even neglect could make children who have attained bladder control suddenly start bedwetting.\n\nAccording to him, when this happens, parents should look around the home environment, playgroup as well as school to find out the form of abuse the child is going through rather than beating or abusing the child.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, the paediatrician said parents need to support their children\u2019s bedwetting by all means.\n\nHe told our correspondent that after attaining bladder control, bedwetting in children has a lot to do with emotional imbalance.\n\nAlege explained, \u201cIt majorly has to do with emotional imbalance. This could follow a traumatic experience as seen in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder such as sudden deprivation of loved ones, witnessing a devastating event e.g fire or road traffic accident.\n\n\u201cOthers could be in form of abuse which could be physical, emotional, sexual abuse, or even neglect. This is more common in children with secondary forms of bedwetting.\n\n\u201cA parent should worry when a child who has previously attained bladder control for more than half a year suddenly starts bed-wetting without any obvious sickness.\n\n\u201cOne should look around the home environment, playgroup as well as the school. Tell-tale signs could include withdrawal from activities, moody appearance, loss of appetite, or poor school performance.\n\n\u201cWhere the abuse is perpetrated by the parents, it may be difficult to make a diagnosis on time. Therefore, the teacher also has a big role to play to unravel the problems.\u201d\n\nThe child health expert cautioned parents against the risk of beating or abusing their children\u2019s bedwetting, warning that it will only worsen the problem.\n\n\u201cA very important thing for parents to know is that bedwetting is neither the fault of the child nor that of the parents.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of the abuse may persist even after the bedwetting resolves. The child may develop low self-esteem, depression and develop poor academic performance.\n\n\u201cParents are strongly advised to desist from punishing or abusing children who bed wet but rather, they should provide all the necessary support to help them overcome the problem,\u201d he added.\n\nAlege affirmed that bedwetting is a curable disease, noting that most cases of bedwetting resolve spontaneously without any intervention.\n\nThe paediatrician said, \u201cSome affected children may have developed psychological complications during the period of bedwetting. All these have to be addressed.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the treatment, the physician said treatment options available vary from lifestyle modification, psychotherapy, alarm treatment, and drug therapy.\n\n\u201cLifestyle modification is usually tailored to advise on fluid intake and voiding (urinating) pattern.\n\n\u201cFluid intake at night should be reduced generally. It is usually prudent to ask the child to urinate in the morning, at least twice during the school day, after school, at dinner time and just before turning out the lights and going to sleep,\u201d the paediatrician said.\n\nAccording to an online health portal, WebMD, emotional problems cause children to bed wet after attaining bladder control.\n\n\u201cA stressful home life, as in a home where the parents are in conflict, sometimes causes children to wet the bed. Children who are being physically or sexually abused sometimes begin bedwetting,\u201d WebMD says.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, ABUJA\n\nThe Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NIDCOM, Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, on Tuesday, asked Nigerians residing abroad to ignore the pockets of security threats in the country and double their investments at home.\n\nDabiri-Erewa, who made the appeal while briefing journalists on the preparation for the 4th Nigeria Diaspora Investment Summit billed to hold from November 16 \u2013 17 in Abuja, stated that targeting Nigerians abroad for inward investment was the best strategy to help the country achieve economic growth and transformation.\n\nA report by the Central Bank Of Nigeria earlier this year revealed that Foreign Direct Investment, FDI, inflow to Nigeria had dropped to $65m as of the end of Q4 of 2020 from $780m as of the end of Q3.\n\nThough the drop was blamed on the COVID-19 pandemic and the heightened security challenges in the land, the latter has increased Nigeria\u2019s risk profile exponentially.\n\nBut Dabiri-Erewa argued that unduly harping on Nigeria\u2019s security problems would further demarket the country before potential investors, and l prove counter-productive to the Federal Government\u2019s quest to increase Diaspora Direct Investment.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe government is not sleeping. All hands are on deck to ensure that the security situation is brought under control. The good thing is people from other countries are coming to invest in Nigeria so why shouldn\u2019t our citizens in the Diaspora do the same?\n\n\u201cWe should stop de-marketing our country. Nigeria is not the only country with challenges. For instance, when I was in the United Kingdom, a parliamentarian was killed, among others but they didn\u2019t say because of that people should stop investing in their country. So we should stop discouraging ourselves\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the primary aim of the summit, Dabiri-Erewa explained that the initiative was designed to demonstrate that at a time when competition for FDI was at its fiercest, targeting Nigerians in Diaspora made more sense than wooing other foreign nationals to invest in the country.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThis is further corroborated by the fact that a number of first and second-generation Nigerians in Diaspora are among a narrow but growing demographic band, experiencing increased wealth with more disposable incomes in the societies where they reside.\n\n\u201cTypically, they have paid off their mortgages, grained their children through college and are either retired or retiring, with a longing for self-actualisation by way of leaving a legacy for the next generation.\n\n\u201cUnlike the foreign investor, they are likely not to become overly influenced by the negative risk profile of the country but are motivated by a sentimental attraction, a strong desire to give back and help in developing the home country for their children and grandchildren. They know the terrain, are familiar with the risks and are thus easier to attract as investors\u201d\n\nShe also noted that the summit would underscore the fact that the $25 million annual remittances from the diaspora to Nigeria, represented game-changing leverage for the country as the economy seeks to exit recession and head pursue sustainable growth.\n\nThe NIDCOM CEO disclosed that the theme of this year\u2019s Nigeria Diaspora Investment Summit would be \u2018Diaspora Partnership and Linkages for Post-COVID Economic Growth\u2019, and added that it would also attract over 5000 participants and 800 core investors across the globe.",

For us in the GSS Group, developers of one of the choicest estates in Anambra and South-East, Nigeria \u2013 the Dubai Estate, actualizing our dream for the provision of exquisite and affordable housing for Ndi Anambra boils down to our choice today.\n\n\u201cUnlike some of the candidates in this election, we, at GSS Group have provided job opportunities for the youths of Anambra State in the past 5years and we are not relenting in doing more.\n\n\u201cWe set up the GSS Real Estate, GSS Construction, GSS Security, GSS Production and BigBen Fashion with our Headquarters in Awka Anambra State, to fight unemployment in the state.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we deserve the best for the prosperity of Ndi Anambra as the Government Policies and Agenda would play a huge role in the dream of solving the four basic needs of Ndi Anambra by GSS Group.\n\n\u201cWith the right governance in place which automatically makes room for ease of doing business, we would continue to partner in ameliorating youth restiveness by increasing our employment quota of young Ndi Anambra.\n\n\u201cI implore Ndi Anambra to come out en masse and vote for the right candidate into power. The power still resides with the people; collectively, we should be able to enthrone good leadership.\n\n\u201cOnce again, my people, especially the youth constituency to which I belong, it behooves us today, to choose between progression and retrogression.\u201d",

          "text": "Immediate past Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has described the crisis that has kept Plateau State House of Assembly under lock as an embarrassment to Nigeria, after practicing democracy for 21 uninterrupted years.\n\nSaraki in a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, head of his Media Office, stated that if the issues that led to the Plateau State legislative crisis had happened in the first few years following the return of democracy in 1999, it would be excusable as part of the learning curve.\n\nHe added that the drama of unconstitutionality and simple lack of respect for due process that is the subject of the crisis to happen in 2021 is only exposing Nigeria to ridicule in the comity of nations.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau crisis should be viewed in a larger context. It is not about Governor Simon Lalong with whom I have personal relationship and enjoy mutual respect. Neither is it about the two claimants to the office of Speaker of the State House of Assembly or their supporters in the legislature. It is even bigger than Plateau State or any individual. The issue is about how the world sees us as a serious democratic country. It is about whether the rest of the world will see us as a people who lack respect for due process and therefore incapable of putting the provisions of our constitution to work on simple matters.\n\n\u201cHow can we after 21 years of democracy be talking of the impeachment of a Speaker by six or eight members (whatever is the correct figure here) in a 24-member legislature and a picture of a parliamentary proceeding to impeach the speaker holding at 7 am? These are developments that will surely make this country a laughing stock in the International community.\n\n\u201cYet, all our leaders and top politicians are silent. We, the political leaders, are behaving as we are unconcerned. This conspiracy of silence is the major worry that I have on this issue. We should all speak against the flagrant disregard for due process and lack of respect for the provisions of the constitution. This is the reason why we make a simple issue complex\u201d, Saraki stated.\n\nHe described the closure of the State Assembly Complex as mere escapism and using a wrong response to correct a wrong development because it is a measure that would deny the people representation and prevent the legislature from performing the duty for which the members are elected.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to state that by the provision of our constitution, only 16 members can validly impeach a Speaker in a 24-member legislature. It is also not difficult to determine whether 16 members of the Plateau State House of Assembly want Hon. Abok Ayuba to be removed as Speaker or not. If those who want him to be removed have the number, it should be easy to determine during a peaceful, properly convened proceeding and if those against the Speaker do not have the number, they should bide their time and go back to renew their strategy. No state machinery or institution should be used to perpetrate or condone illegality.\n\n\u201cAll of us should learn to insist on the right thing being done at all times, no matter who is involved and what their motive is. My concern is the need to always take actions that will strengthen, not weaken, our democracy and its institutions. We should stop exposing our country to ridicule and contempt of the global community. Maybe I feel this way because of my antecedent as a former legislative leader who was also a victim of the disrespect for due process and constitution.\n\n\u201cI hereby urge all political leaders to speak out on the need to respect due process and protect the integrity of our political system. We should all make interventions that will help the country\u2019s democracy to grow\u201d, Saraki stat",

          "title": "Paris Club refund: Court bars Buhari, AGF from deducting $418m from states",
          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday restrained President Muhammadu Buhari, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and five others from proceeding with the planned deduction of about $418 million from the accounts of the 36 states in settlement of alleged debt from the Paris Club Refund and judgements got by some individuals and firms against the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON).\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo issued the order after listening to Jibrin Okutepa (SAN) and Ahmed Raji (SAN) who argued the states\u2019 ex-parte application.\n\nAlso restrained by the court order were the Accountant General of the Federation, Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Debt Management Office (DMO) and Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) -who are all listed as the first to seventh defendants in suit FHC/ABJ/CS/ 1313/2021.\n\nBut the federal government insisted ,last night,that the deductions were lawful.\n\nWhile moving the ex-parte motion filed by the 36 states, Otukepa, argued that his clients would be crippled if the Federal Government, acting through the first to seventh defendant, went ahead to deduct the huge amount from the bank accounts of the States.\n\nHe said the Federal Government claimed that the planned monthly deduction, scheduled to commence at the end of November, was to settle debts for contracts allegedly executed for the states.\n\nOtukepa, however, said that the 36 states\u2019 Attorneys-General have read the purported judgment displayed by the Federal Government and found that the states were not parties to the court cases which led to the judgment debt.\n\nHe added that the purported contract claimed to have been executed for the states was not known to any of the 36 state governments and is therefore a phony contract.\n\nOkutepa noted that the Federal Government was the only party to the court case that resulted in the judgment and therefore such judgment is not binding on the state government.\n\nIn a brief ruling, Justice Ekwo granted three of the four reliefs contained in the ex-parte motion, with the one that sought a refund, which Okutepa agreed to withdraw on the grounds that no deduction had been made.\n\nJustice Ekwo then adjourned further hearing till November 30.\n\nDeductions lawful, Federal Government insists\n\nReacting, the Federal Government faulted the claim by the 36 state governments that the planned deduction of $418million was unlawful.\n\nIt said the debt arose from contracts willfully entered by the states and Local Government, which resulted in litigations and judgments given in favour of the consultants engaged by them.\n\nUmar Gwandu, the media aide to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami,said in a statement that the Federal Government gave funds to the states and Local Governments, between 2016 and 2018, to defray consultancy fees and related expenses incurred by them.\n\nThe FG wondered why the same states and LG, that had paid part of the Paris Club refund debt to the same consultants, were now opposed to its move for final settlement of the outstanding debt.\n\nHe said:\u201dIt is remarkable to note that the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) at various times in 2016 and 2018 received payments from the Federal Government under the guise of legal and consultancy fees related to the same Paris Club refunds.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, NGF was paid US$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and US$100,000,000.00 in 2018. It was, however, convenient at that time not to complain about payment of consultants,\u201d the FG said.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt can be noticed that some reports contain willful statements suggesting that some government officers were acting without due process in the settlement of certain judgment debts (totaling US$418million) arising from the deduction and refunds due to the States and Local Governments from the Paris Club loan refunds.\n\n\u201cIt is important and necessary to state, at the onset, that the deductions were on account of four judgments in contention which were delivered at various times in 2014, 2015, 2017 & 2019.\n\n\u201cTwo of these judgments were consent judgments based on terms of settlement entered into by NGF in 2017 & 2019. Again, two of the four judgments were based on an earlier judgment delivered by the Federal High Court in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, amazing that from 2013 \u2013 2021 neither NGF nor ALGON deemed it fit to either challenge or fully comply with any of these judgments. In furtherance of the consent and settlement the NGF itself made payments in billions to the consultants based on the same judgment it is deriding now.\n\n\u201cBy various letters addressed to the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Honourable Minister of Finance, both NGF and ALGON expressed no objection and actually recommended the same set of consultants for payment.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the judgement debts were much higher than the above figure, but these officers ensured that the consultants granted a consistent concessional offer.\n\n\u201cThe office of the HAGF also subjected the claims of the consultants/contractors to investigations by both the DSS and EFCC in order to further ascertain the veracity of the claims. Recommendations for payment were thus made based on the positive outcomes of these investigations.\n\n\u201cSince both NGF and ALGON that have entered into judicial settlement on account of which consent judgment was entered have refused to comply with these judgments, it became pertinent for the Federal Government to take the initiative in order to prevent a situation where the debt liability of NGF and ALGON would be transferred to the Federal Government and eventually excluded against its assets and interest.\n\n\u201cThe interest of the Federal Government to intervene in the negotiated settlement was borne out of the fact that the Consultants made Federal Government a party to the action against NGF and ALGON the implication of which was that the judgment may be executed against the interest and assets of the Federal Government over liability that was incurred exclusively by NGF and ALGON in respect of which the Federal Government is not responsible.\n\n\u201cIt is curious to note that both NGF and ALGON who had actual knowledge of these judgments between 2013 and 2019, consented to their partial compliance and also undertook in 2019 to settle them from their FAAC Allocations, only turned around in 2021 to take steps to challenge the judgments.\u201d",

They warned about the danger of denying him access to good medical care and allowing him to die in captivity in foreign land.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nIgboho had reportedly developed some health challenges, including kidney problem in Cotonou prison, where he is being remanded for alleged immigration offences, when he attempted to travel to Germany through the city\u2019s airport.\n\nSome of the groups that are worried by the development said they were planning consultations on how best to negotiate his freedom. They appealed to the government of Benin Republic to allow him access to medical help in any place of his choice. In a bid to form a united front on the issue, YCE said it would meet with the leader of Afenifere for discussions on possible way to intervene in his case and probably secure his release through diplomatic strategies.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, who regretted that the body has no link with Igboho at the moment, noted that his group was making efforts to link up with Pa Ayo Adebanjo, the Afenifere leader, to try and reach the Nigerian Ambassador to Benin Republic, Gen Tukur Buratai (retd) and see what could be done to get him freed.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, also pleaded with the government of Benin Republic to do all that is humanly possible and as soon as possible to release him to get medical help in a place of his choice.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom what we heard, he is looking in the direction of France or Germany.

          "text": "Wahab Kareem, Assistant Superintendent of Police, on Friday told an Ikeja Special Offences Court that Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James alias \u201cBaba Ijesha\u201d was facing another allegation of child defilement.\n\nKareem, attached to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Yaba, Lagos, testified as the fifth prosecution witness in James\u2019s trial for defilement of a minor. Led in evidence by state counsel, Mr. Yusuf Sule, the police officer said: \u201cDuring our investigation, another girl (name withheld) came forward and said the defendant assaulted her when she was 12-years-old.\n\n\u201cWe interviewed her and the defendant behind the counter, and he vehemently denied the allegation. The girl said the incident occurred at Agah area of Ikorodu, and we told a representative of the defendant to follow us to the house, and we met the landlord. The landlord showed us an apartment and said: \u201cThis is where Baba Ijesha used to stay. Meanwhile, the defendant had denied living in that area.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

During proceedings, a video recording of James at the SCID admitting to sexually assaulting the foster daughter comedienne Damilola Adekoya alias Princess was played.\n\n\u201cI harassed her, I touched her hand and I licked her hand,\u201d the defendant said in the clip.\u201d Earlier, Kareem testified that he was asked to take over the investigation of the case from a team due to complaints from Adekoya. \u201cI was asked to take over the matter from Team A because the complainant (Princess) had complained about the closeness between the defendant and members of Team A.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\n\u201cAfter conclusion of investigation, I transferred the file to the Directorate of Public Prosecution for legal advice,\u201d he said. While being cross-examined by Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Kareem said that he never visited the crime scene, adding that Adekoya brought the other minor who also accused the defendant of defilement to the police. He said that the statement of the defendant\u2019s former landlord was recorded at the landlord\u2019s residence and not at a police station. He, however, told the court that the statement was taken to his superior, CSP Margaret Ighodalo.\n\nWhen asked to show where his superior countersigned the landlord\u2019s statement as required by law, the witness said the landlord\u2019s statement was not countersigned. The policeman testified that a lawyer was not present when James made his initial statement to the police at the SCID. He added that James was not taken to Ikorodu to counter the other claim of defilement due to security reasons.\n\n\u201cThe defendant was the one who asked his brother to take us to Ikorodu. We did not take him there because of security reasons; his name was all over the news on televisions and radios. He could have been hijacked from us; that is why we told him to nominate someone and he nominated his brother to go with us,\u201d Kareem said.\n\nJames faces a six-count charge bordering on indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration. The offences contravene Sections 135, 259, 262, 263 and 262 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.

This is certain to affect turnout of voters.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high, with streets deserted, but the police and other security agencies have assured Anambra State voters of maximum security and want them to come out without fear. Indeed, every nook and cranny of the state is heavily policed.\n\nAs part of measures aimed at protecting the election, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 PM yesterday, 5th November, 2021 to 11:59 PM today, 6th November, 2021.\n\nThe IG noted that the restriction had become necessary following pointers from the Election Security Threats Assessments conducted by the Force, \u201cwhich indicate a high likelihood of infiltration by criminally-minded individuals to Anambra State, before, during and after the polls.\u201d\n\nBaba further noted that the measure would also avail security forces a firm grip of the state, to checkmate the movement of political thugs and touts, and prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs throughout the period and beyond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baba sent out a strong warning thus: \u201cWe have identified some more flashpoints, but we can handle that without problem. We have 85 per cent of personnel and assets on ground. Our helicopters are down and we have gun boats to take care of the marines and we know the Navy will assist in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure that there is enough security on ground. We have sent signals to those who want to make trouble not to test our will. Those who tried last weekend had sad stories to tell, if at all they were able to get to their camps.\u201d\n\nThe IG had earlier ordered the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 police personnel and three police helicopters to Anambra State ahead of the election.\n\nThe IG said the 34,587 personnel included conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), special forces personnel, Explosives Ordinance Unit (EOD), Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), Interpol, Special Protection Unit (SPU), as well as police medical teams expected to be on ground to guarantee a hitch-free election.\n\nHe said three police helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance amongst other operational capabilities.\n\nThe Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi yesterday announced the deployment of 20,000 personnel drawn from Anambra State and neighbouring state commands, to assist the police with security for today\u2019s election.\n\nAudi assured the people that the election will hold peacefully and successfully without rancor or acrimony \u201cas the Corps is working in synergy and collaboration with other sister agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, security agencies, sensitive and non-sensitive election materials, INEC permanent and ad-hoc staff and all other apparatuses deployed to ensure a hitch free election.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, earlier appointed as head of the special police team providing security for today\u2019s election, was also removed yesterday without any reason given. Egbunike hails from Anambra State and oversees the five police commands in the South-east\n\nThe new team leader for today\u2019s election is Assistant Inspector General Zaki Ahmed, until now the second in command to DIG Egbunike.\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakub also assured Anambra people of a credible election and security of lives and property.\n\nYakub, who spoke during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the INEC headquarters in Awka on Tuesday, said: \u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice. We have received assurances from the security agencies and they said they are capable of ensuring security for all. On our part, we assure Anambra people it will be free, fair and credible election.\n\nThe Leading Contenders\n\nThough there are 18 candidates on the ballot, in practical terms, there are only three candidates in the race for Anambra governorship today.\n\nThese are Charles Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA); Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThough, there is no written agreement on the rotation of governorship in Anambra State on Senatorial basis, this has in many previous elections determined the emergence of a governor.\n\nThis year, Anambra South is the most favoured for governorship, and all three most popular candidates \u2013 Valentine Ozigbo, Chukwuma Soludo and Andy Uba \u2013 who represent the three major political parties in the race, picked their candidates from that zone.\n\nIncidentally, all three leading candidates also come from Aguata Local Government Area. While the three candidates will be sharing the votes in the zone, their ability to garner votes from the North and Central zones, will guarantee their victory.\n\nOzigbo hails from Amesi in Aguata LGA. His philanthropic gestures and support for sports gave him popularity in his Southern zone, but he also has the advantage of having the support of most top politicians in the central, which will give him an edge.\n\nAs he battles for votes in the Southern zone with other candidates, he has the support of the Central zone through the former governor Peter Obi, who supports his aspiration. He will also enjoy massive votes from supporters of Senator Uche Ekwunife who is also his campaign coordinator. Ozigbo may however not do so well in the Northern zone, as he would have the incumbent governor to contend with.\n\nUba hails also from the Southern zone, Uga in Aguata LGA. He is a veteran politician and has contested for the position many times, and this has given him a lot of popularity. In the Southern zone, Uba is also very popular, but will be splitting his votes in the zone with Soludo and Ozigbo. However, in the North, Uba who has several lieutenants in the zone, including the chairman of his political party and his campaign coordinator, will likely sway votes in his direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Uba has a minus in the Central zone, as the minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who also has a large following in the Central zone, does not support him as a result of the fall-out of the governorship primary election of the party last June.\n\nSoludo, former Central Bank Governor, may not be popular in his own zone, but what he lacks in popularity, his party, which is widely accepted in the state has. He and his party also have high popularity in the Central zone, just as it is expected that his largest number of votes will come from the Northern zone. This is because of the influence of the incumbent governor, who is giving him his unalloyed support, just as federal and state lawmakers in the zone are also in support of Soludo.\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nAmid fear and tension, caused by an endless bloodbath, which hindered campaigns of the political parties, the people of Anambra State will this morning vote to elect a new governor.\n\nThough, the outlawed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it is not opposed to the poll and has withdrawn its stay-at-home order, there is still palpable fear across the state, with many afraid that terrorists may attack voters. This is certain to affect turnout of voters.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high, with streets deserted, but the police and other security agencies have assured Anambra State voters of maximum security and want them to come out without fear. Indeed, every nook and cranny of the state is heavily policed.\n\nAs part of measures aimed at protecting the election, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 PM yesterday, 5th November, 2021 to 11:59 PM today, 6th November, 2021.\n\nThe IG noted that the restriction had become necessary following pointers from the Election Security Threats Assessments conducted by the Force, \u201cwhich indicate a high likelihood of infiltration by criminally-minded individuals to Anambra State, before, during and after the polls.\u201d\n\nBaba further noted that the measure would also avail security forces a firm grip of the state, to checkmate the movement of political thugs and touts, and prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs throughout the period and beyond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baba sent out a strong warning thus: \u201cWe have identified some more flashpoints, but we can handle that without problem. We have 85 per cent of personnel and assets on ground. Our helicopters are down and we have gun boats to take care of the marines and we know the Navy will assist in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure that there is enough security on ground. We have sent signals to those who want to make trouble not to test our will. Those who tried last weekend had sad stories to tell, if at all they were able to get to their camps.\u201d\n\nThe IG had earlier ordered the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 police personnel and three police helicopters to Anambra State ahead of the election.\n\nThe IG said the 34,587 personnel included conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), special forces personnel, Explosives Ordinance Unit (EOD), Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), Interpol, Special Protection Unit (SPU), as well as police medical teams expected to be on ground to guarantee a hitch-free election.\n\nHe said three police helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance amongst other operational capabilities.\n\nThe Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi yesterday announced the deployment of 20,000 personnel drawn from Anambra State and neighbouring state commands, to assist the police with security for today\u2019s election.\n\nAudi assured the people that the election will hold peacefully and successfully without rancor or acrimony \u201cas the Corps is working in synergy and collaboration with other sister agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, security agencies, sensitive and non-sensitive election materials, INEC permanent and ad-hoc staff and all other apparatuses deployed to ensure a hitch free election.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, earlier appointed as head of the special police team providing security for today\u2019s election, was also removed yesterday without any reason given. Egbunike hails from Anambra State and oversees the five police commands in the South-east\n\nThe new team leader for today\u2019s election is Assistant Inspector General Zaki Ahmed, until now the second in command to DIG Egbunike.\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakub also assured Anambra people of a credible election and security of lives and property.\n\nYakub, who spoke during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the INEC headquarters in Awka on Tuesday, said: \u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice.

Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlso, the attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\u201d\n\nAde-Ojo: I Didn\u2019t Sell Collapsed Building\u2019s Land to Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of Elizade Motors and Elizade University, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo has said he did not sell the land of the collapsed building in Ikoyi to Osinbajo.\n\nAde-Ojo, who said this in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, however, added that he owns a property adjacent to the collapsed building and that he is not willing to sell it.\n\nDeath Toll Now 38\n\nThe Lagos State Government yesterday said bodies recovered from the Ikoyi collapsed building were ready for identification and called on families to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) Yaba to identify the corpses of their loved ones.\n\nThe state government said 38 bodies had been recovered so far from the collapsed building as rescue operation entered Day Four yesterday, while family members had submitted 32 names of those still missing.\n\nLagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, while giving an update to the press, said the bodies would be ready for identification from 4pm yesterday.\n\nOmotoso said an autopsy would be carried out on the corpses before releasing them to their families.\n\nHe said recovery work was still ongoing and would continue until the government is able account for everybody inside the building at the time of the collapse and certify that nobody is left behind in the collapsed building.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The relations of Femi Osibona, owner of the 21-storey building that collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos State, are currently in a messy fight over the personal property of the deceased, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSources close to the family told SaharaReporters that the wife, who had just flown in from the United States, tried gaining access to her husband's apartment along Mosley Road, Ikoyi but she was denied access by some of Osibona\u2019s brothers.\n\nFemi Osibona\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Mrs Osibona who had four children for the late Femi is presently in a fight-to-finish with the brothers who are laying claim to the deceased\u2019s array of exotic cars, bank account details and other assets.\n\nThe family allegedly denied the wife access to the deceased\u2019s apartment because there were bundles of money, keys to expensive vehicles and others in the house.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that the two family factions came with Mobile Police Officers (MOPOL) after which they were all locked out by residents of the building who are neighbours of the deceased.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThe brothers and wife of Femi Osibona are fighting over access to bank details of the deceased and keys to expensive vehicles. This is despite the fact that the man has a wife and four kids. The body is yet to be buried; they are already fighting over his property. His wife was at the site yesterday, shouting at his brothers. I think there are loads of cash in the house.\n\n\u201cFemi's brothers have stopped his wife and daughter from getting into his apartment. It is such a mess that money has become the root of all this evil. The brother asked the wife to go and stay at the hotel and she claimed she has no money to go there.\u201d\n\nAnother source said, \u201cThe woman came to the house with MOPOL; the family also engaged the services of MOPOL. On each side, there were about twenty people shouting on one another. When it was already midnight, we chased every one of them out of the house. They were outside till midnight shouting, swearing, boasting and threatening. Instead of mourning, these people were fighting over assets. They have also engaged popular lawyer, Olisa Agbakoba, on the matter.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had during the week reported that the Chief Executive Officer of Fourscore Homes Limited, Femi Osibona, was confirmed dead and recovered from the rubble of the collapsed structure after about four days.\n\nThe body of Osibona was discovered among others during the rescue operation on Thursday.\n\nThere had been concerns over the whereabouts of Osibona, Wale Bob-Oseni, his friend, and others trapped in the building.\n\nBob-Oseni, who was to catch a flight to the US, briefly made a detour to see the project at the invitation of the developer but did not walk out alive.\n\nOn Monday, the building located on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos collapsed with a yet-to-be-ascertained number of persons still trapped beneath the rubble. The death toll currently stands at over 40 persons.\n\nEmergency workers had evacuated more than nine persons alive from the debris of the fallen building.\n\nAccording to Highbrow Living Magazine, the collapsed property, comprising four-bedroom maisonettes, flats, duplex and penthouses, was 65 per cent sold out.\n\nThe price range for the apartment is also said to be between $1.2 million and $5 million.\n\nThe structure was said to be 80 per cent completed and was billed to be concluded in 2022.",

The AGF had also ordered a probe into the invasion.\n\nWhile speaking at a press briefing in Lagos on Friday, Akpata said the probe panel ought not to be set up by the AGF because he is also a suspect in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the president, the head of the executive arm of government, to set up an independent panel of inquiry, to look into this assault on the judiciary, which is another arm of government because there is a dark cloud hanging and all fingers are pointing at the executive as being behind this action,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt behoves Mr president to step in immediately, to set up this panel of inquiry, which, at the minimum, will have a judicial officer and the NBA involved so that we can get to the bottom of this issue and ask who gave that instruction?\n\n\u201cWe note that the attorney-general of the federation has reportedly agreed to make himself available for investigation. This is consistent with the position of the National Executive Council of the NBA, to the effect that the attorney-general definitely has questions to answer. However, he cannot subject himself to a panel that he sets up. This is why the panel to be set up by the president is very necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the attorney-general is found culpable, then as a lawyer, we will take him before the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee and the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee; because if indeed, he is found to have given the directives that led to the invasion of the home of the Justice of the Supreme Court, then he is not fit to hold the office he occupies presently and continue to be the recipient of the privileges the profession has accorded to him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the NBA has the power to discipline the AGF, Akpata said: \u201cThere is a mechanism, and that is for us to bring him before the LPDC and what does the LPDC do? What is the ultimate sanction, amongst others? He can be stopped from practising law. What does the LPPC do, amongst others? The LPPC can strip him of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria and also the Body of Benchers can reconsider his life membership of that body. So, without mincing words, those are the steps that the NBA can take.\u201d\n\nAkpata also added that action will be taken against Emmanuel Iyanna, the chief magistrate who issued the search warrant leading to the invasion of Odili\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cQuestions must be asked of the quality and sufficiency of the materials placed before his worship before issuing the search warrant in the first place. The NBA National Executive Council believes that even on a cursory reading of the materials placed before his worship, there is a prima facie evidence that the search warrant ought not to have been issued in the circumstance,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Dele Momodu, journalist and former presidential candidate, says Femi Osibona, owner of Fourscore Homes and developer of the 21-storey building that collapsed in Lagos, did not cut corners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable had reported the collapse of the edifice that killed over 30 people, including Osibona.\n\nIn an opinion article titled, \u2018The Unsolvable Jigsaw of the Ikoyi Tragedy\u2019, Momodu said Osibona was an ambitious man and not the \u201cgreedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had known Femi for over 20 years in London as an extremely gifted marketer. Femi\u2019s tongue was honey-coated, and it was impossible not to like him,\u201d Momodu said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe lost touch after I ended exile and returned to Africa, but he soon traced me to Ghana, and he came visiting. He was so happy to reunite with me. He told me how God had blessed him mightily and had made him veer into real estate in London. Femi was a genius who made stupendous gains from regenerating ghetto neighbourhoods in East London. He regaled me with tales of his exploits in the property business.\n\n\u201cHe promised to build the classiest residential apartments in Africa. He said he was out to prove there was nothing the multinational construction companies were doing that his company can\u2019t do. I have never seen such a level of audacity, determination and tenacity. Fourscore was a visionary and a missionary when it came to seeking to excel and do as well as his international counterparts at home and abroad. He had competed in their space, in their countries before, with moderate successes and did not see any reason why he could not replicate the same and attain loftier heights in his home country.\n\n\u201cIf he made any mistakes, it was probably that he overstretched himself, but he was such an ambitious man, full of faith. And certainly not the greedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is. In our country, mistakes are never excused, forgiven or forgotten. When you fail, you\u2019re a villain and outcast. When you succeed, you\u2019re a hero, genius and superstar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOut of the failing of Femi Fourscore would arise a Nigerian Neil Armstrong who will make building on the sea seem like strolling to the next street. That I believe is Femi Fourscore\u2019s legacy, challenging us to believe that what may seem impossible is indeed possible by dint of hard work and if at first, you do not succeed, keep trying, because your time will come.\n\n\u201cI will never give excuses for Femi. He tried but he couldn\u2019t unfortunately deliver on the tall and tough target he set for himself. I am pretty sure that it was not because he was cutting corners or taking risks. The block that fell was the one he intended to live in. No man would be prepared to be a kamikaze pilot in such a situation.\n\nMomodu said the inquest and investigation ordered into the incident should be done diligently and not hurriedly.\n\n\u201cIt must be painstaking and thorough. Such investigations cannot last thirty days as being directed by the government; I foresee that any credible inquiry must take months of arduous diligent work. Various possibilities including negligence, sabotage and even natural or human causes such as the over-dredging occurring in that vicinity must be considered. Dead men tell no tales. They cannot defend themselves, but records and logic abound,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose making claims and allegations which are easily rumpled will soon be exposed. I\u2019d known that In February 2020 the third block was at the beginning of the foundation stage and the other two blocks were merely a few storeys gone. It is interesting that nobody who had any misgivings reported such to the Regulators. I say no more, other than that it is always convenient to cast aspersions when it seems there is no potential for the reply.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is Fourscore was a self-made man who depended on no godfather. Despite being a cousin of the vice-president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he was too proud and self-reliant to approach the vice-president or anybody else for favours of that kind. He never sought for or got any government contracts.

          "text": "Dele Momodu, journalist and former presidential candidate, says Femi Osibona, owner of Fourscore Homes and developer of the 21-storey building that collapsed in Lagos, did not cut corners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable had reported the collapse of the edifice that killed over 30 people, including Osibona.\n\nIn an opinion article titled, \u2018The Unsolvable Jigsaw of the Ikoyi Tragedy\u2019, Momodu said Osibona was an ambitious man and not the \u201cgreedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had known Femi for over 20 years in London as an extremely gifted marketer. Femi\u2019s tongue was honey-coated, and it was impossible not to like him,\u201d Momodu said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe lost touch after I ended exile and returned to Africa, but he soon traced me to Ghana, and he came visiting. He was so happy to reunite with me. He told me how God had blessed him mightily and had made him veer into real estate in London. Femi was a genius who made stupendous gains from regenerating ghetto neighbourhoods in East London. He regaled me with tales of his exploits in the property business.\n\n\u201cHe promised to build the classiest residential apartments in Africa. He said he was out to prove there was nothing the multinational construction companies were doing that his company can\u2019t do. I have never seen such a level of audacity, determination and tenacity. Fourscore was a visionary and a missionary when it came to seeking to excel and do as well as his international counterparts at home and abroad. He had competed in their space, in their countries before, with moderate successes and did not see any reason why he could not replicate the same and attain loftier heights in his home country.\n\n\u201cIf he made any mistakes, it was probably that he overstretched himself, but he was such an ambitious man, full of faith. And certainly not the greedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is. In our country, mistakes are never excused, forgiven or forgotten. When you fail, you\u2019re a villain and outcast. When you succeed, you\u2019re a hero, genius and superstar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOut of the failing of Femi Fourscore would arise a Nigerian Neil Armstrong who will make building on the sea seem like strolling to the next street. That I believe is Femi Fourscore\u2019s legacy, challenging us to believe that what may seem impossible is indeed possible by dint of hard work and if at first, you do not succeed, keep trying, because your time will come.\n\n\u201cI will never give excuses for Femi. He tried but he couldn\u2019t unfortunately deliver on the tall and tough target he set for himself. I am pretty sure that it was not because he was cutting corners or taking risks. The block that fell was the one he intended to live in. No man would be prepared to be a kamikaze pilot in such a situation.\n\nMomodu said the inquest and investigation ordered into the incident should be done diligently and not hurriedly.\n\n\u201cIt must be painstaking and thorough. Such investigations cannot last thirty days as being directed by the government; I foresee that any credible inquiry must take months of arduous diligent work. Various possibilities including negligence, sabotage and even natural or human causes such as the over-dredging occurring in that vicinity must be considered. Dead men tell no tales. They cannot defend themselves, but records and logic abound,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose making claims and allegations which are easily rumpled will soon be exposed. I\u2019d known that In February 2020 the third block was at the beginning of the foundation stage and the other two blocks were merely a few storeys gone. It is interesting that nobody who had any misgivings reported such to the Regulators. I say no more, other than that it is always convenient to cast aspersions when it seems there is no potential for the reply.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is Fourscore was a self-made man who depended on no godfather. Despite being a cousin of the vice-president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he was too proud and self-reliant to approach the vice-president or anybody else for favours of that kind. He never sought for or got any government contracts. He relied on his own ability, marketing skills and funds.\n\n\u201cIt has been most painful reading how some people reduced Femi\u2019s epic struggles and vision to fronting for the vice-president. For me, this is one of the tragedies of this unfortunate saga. The worst of them would be the number of innocent casualties buried in the debris with Femi.\u201d",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value.

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

Sam Tumba, the Parish Priest of Holy Rosary Catholic Church, Wuse, Zone 11, has urged church members not to doubt the veracity of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHe urged them to go ahead and take the jab.\n\nTumba gave the advice at the ordination of five deacons as Catholic priests which also marks the 40th ordination anniversary of the Archbishop of Abuja Diocese, Ignatius Kaigama, at the SS Peter Catholic Church, Nyanya, on Friday.\n\nHe said that the COVID-19 vaccines were meant to prevent virus and turn save lives.\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to doubt the veracity of the production and administration of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe Pope has taken the vaccine, so also the Archbishop and so church members should go ahead to take them.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow ourselves to be misled by people propagating conspiracy theories about the vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nTumba, however, encouraged the newly ordained priests to remain focused and humble.\n\nHe noted that their ordination would greatly impact the church in the area of workforce.\n\nHe urged the ordained priests to be cautious and act Christ-like before the people of God.\n\nQuoting the biblical book of Acts of the Apostle, Chapter 1, Verse 8, he said the ordination would prepare the priests for the universal mission of salvation.\n\nAccording to him, the priesthood is a mysterious journey but only your faith will keep you going.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we have seen the growth of our diocese. In the past, we may be borrowing priests but today the archdiocese can boast of sending priests for missionary.\n\n\u201cWith the ordination of the new five priests, this will bring the total number of priests in the Abuja diocese to over 100.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the archdiocese of Abuja has done well, we can equally send out priests to work in other dioceses in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe priest added that the journey of the five into priesthood began about a decade ago, while urging them to devote their lives to taking care of the needy in the church.\n\nHe, therefore, called on policy makers, who are members of the church, to help the church take its rightful place in the country.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the five newly ordained priests are Rev. Fr Humphrey Ayegba, Joseph Dankyang, Micheal Nzumeang, Peter Agbo and Emmanuel Okonkwo.\n\nThe highlight of the ordination witnessed the investiture of priesthood robes on the ordained priests and anointing of their hands.\n\nAlso, the Cardinal Archbishop Emeritus of Abuja, Archbishop John Onaiyekan, congratulated the priests for their journey into the priesthood.\n\nOnaiyekan urged them to keep in mind the purpose of their ambitions to do the work and as well build the church of God.\n\nOne of the ordained priests, Rev. Fr Joseph Dankyang, said that his love for priesthood and their lifestyles spurred him into becoming a priest.\n\nDankyang said this led him into deriving joy in the vocation while thanking priests who came his way during the journey for inspirations which led him to becoming a priest.\n\n...",

          "text": "There were several cases of the malfunction of the Biomodal Voters Authentication System (BVAS) in many polling units in Anambra East Local Government Area of Anambra State.\n\nAnambra East is one of the 21 local governments in Anambra where a governorship election is being held today.\n\nThe local government consists of about six towns, Umuoba, Agulere, Umulere, Nnado, Ngsube, and Igbaremu.\n\nThe outgoing governor of the state, Willie Obiano, is from the local government.\n\nMr Obiano whose polling unit is at Eri Primary School, Unit 004, Otuocha 1, Aguleri, Anambra East LGA, exercised his franchise hitch-free.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how Mr Obiano and his wife, Ebelechukwu, cast their ballot using the BVAS machine at about 9:28 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nHowever, in many polling units observed by our reporters, the machines malfunctioned and did not authenticate many voters\u2019 fingerprints, as well as facial recognition, making the entire process slow and cumbersome.\n\nAs of 10:37 a.m., nobody at the Polling Unit 005 WARD 11, Otuocha 1, Wri Primary School 2, Anambra East LGA, had been accredited.\n\nThe Presiding Officer, Abong Mathews, who spoke to our reporter, said that voting started at 8:30 a.m. and none of the 756 total registered voters at the centre had cast a vote.\n\nHe complained about the malfunction of the BVAS machine.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS machine has been a major issue for us here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe machine cannot authorise fingerprints and facial recognition.\u201d\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES visited PU 007, WARD 12, Otuocha 2, Oche primary school II, the officials also had problems with the BVAS machine.\n\nThe Presiding Officer (PO), who refused to disclose his identity, said the BVAS had only been able to accredit one voter.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS has delayed voting processes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is having an issue authenticating voters fingerprint and it is also having difficulty identifying facial recognition.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have called for a backup from my RAC officer, they said they are working on it. It\u2019s over hours now, nothing has been done about it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy supervisor just said I should go and buy data and connect to the machine and it will start working.\n\n\u201cI have about 64 gigs loaded at the machine, I have refreshed it several times and it\u2019s still not working,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, at Polling Unit 008, Ward 12, Otuocha Umulere Town Hall, Anambra East, voting started at about 8 a.m.\n\nThe Presiding Officer, Nnenna Vivian, told PREMIUM TIMES that they had only been able to accredit two voters, as of 9.40 a.m.\n\nChinedu Morah, a party agent of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), who spoke to our reporter at Ward 12, Otuocha 2 Oche Primary School, blamed INEC for the situation.\n\nHe urged the commission to allow the use of manual voting since the machine is not working.\n\nA voter, Uwaoma Anukwu, at Ward 12, Otuocha 2, Oche Primary School, lamented the situation.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing is not good, I don\u2019t like it. We have been here since morning, we called on INEC, they said we should go and buy data, and we bought it. I paid for it. And it\u2019s still not working.\n\n\u201cINEC should come to our help, we have not been able to vote, we have over a hundred registered voters and they cannot vote it\u2019s not good,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat is BVAS?\n\nThe BVAS is a device that combines fingerprint and facial recognition for the verification of voters. It replaced the Smart Card Readers used in previous elections.\n\nEfforts to reach an INEC spokesperson, Festus Okoye, for a reaction was unsuccessful. He did not return calls and text messages sent to his known phone number.\n\nA total of 18 parties are taking part in the Anambra governorship election.",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

He was Secretary of ACN in the FCT before the formation of the mega APC.\n\nHowever, unlike some of the aspirants in the APC national chairmanship race who are publicly backed by one or more prominent figures in the party, Mr Moniedafe at the moment has only his campaign promises.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Federal Government from executing its plan to deduct $418 million from the bank account of the 36 states of the Federation.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo issued a restraining order against the Federal Government on Friday following an ex parte application brought by the counsels to the 36 states, Jibril Otukepa and Ahmed Raji.\n\nWhile moving the application, Okutepa who led the legal team of the states told the judge that the states would be completely crippled if the federal government should go ahead to deduct the huge amount from the bank accounts of their clients.\n\nIn 2006, Nigeria paid $12 billion to get a $18 billion debt write-off by the Paris Club of international creditors.\n\nStates and local governments that did not owe the Paris Club, according to reports, later asked for a refund after it was discovered that the payment was made directly from the revenue accruing to the entire federation.\n\nReports later emerged that some consultants, who claimed a percentage of the refunds as payment for services they said they rendered to the states and local governments, went to court in a bid to get their pay.\n\nThe sum of $418 million was agreed as a judgment debt after the Federal Government opted to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with the contractors.\n\nBut this move was rejected by the states who sought redress in court after the Federal Government said it would commence the deduction.\n\nThe Attorneys-General of the 36 states were listed as plaintiffs in the suit filed by their lawyers on October 27.\n\nJoined as respondents included the President, the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Accountant-General of the Federation, and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nOthers were the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Debt Management Office, the Federal Account Allocation Committee, and various commercial banks in the country.\n\nThe states, among others, had also sought an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government, any of its agencies, or any other person from deducting any money due to the states for the payment of any judgement debts arising from contracts and suits in relation to the Paris Club Refund.\n\nThey requested the refund of any money deducted by the government from the Federation Account so far in relation to the issue in dispute, without the express consent of the states.\n\nThe states based the application on 13 grounds, which included that the plaintiffs were the attorneys-general and chief law officers of their respective states as created by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cPart of the deductions in the FAAC summary is for the liquidation of judgement debts in favour of persons who neither had any contractual relationship with the plaintiffs/applicants nor obtained any judgement against any of the plaintiffs/applicants,\u201d the fourth ground of the application read.",

          "text": "A New York county prosecutor on Friday asked a judge to delay for two months the arraignment of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on a misdemeanor sex offense charge, saying a local sheriff may have botched the case by rushing to file the complaint.\n\nCuomo resigned in August in the middle of his third term as governor after a five-month official inquiry found that he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\nAlbany County Sheriff Craig Apple filed a \u201cforcible touching\u201d charge against Cuomo last month based on one woman\u2019s accusation that Cuomo groped her under her blouse at the Executive Mansion in the New York state capital of Albany.\n\nBut the charge against Cuomo was \u201cpotentially defective,\u201d Albany County District Attorney David Soares wrote in a letter to the judge dated Thursday because it failed to include a sworn statement from the accuser.\n\nSoares asked Albany City Court Judge Holly Trexler to delay Cuomo\u2019s arraignment, which had been scheduled for Nov. 17, for 60 days to give his office more time to review the case and possibly avoid a procedural dismissal. Cuomo\u2019s attorney supported the request, and the judge granted the delay, scheduling Cuomo\u2019s arraignment for Jan. 7, a spokesperson for Soares said.\n\nSoares said in his letter that his office had been investigating Cuomo for months when the sheriff surprised him with a criminal filing.\n\n\u201cWe were in the middle of that investigation when the Sheriff unilaterally and inexplicably filed a complaint in this Court. Unfortunately the filings is this matter are potentially defective in that the police-officer-complainant failed to include a sworn statement by the victim such that the (state) could proceed with a prosecution,\u201d the Soares letter said.\n\nSoares also said his office was still reviewing hundreds of hours of videotaped testimony and volumes of documents produced by the five-month probe that was conducted by independent lawyers under the direction of state Attorney General Tish James.\n\nSheriff Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. In comments to the Albany Times Union, he said his office followed proper procedures.\n\n\u201cThere was sworn testimony included, and we followed the policies and protocols set to interview victims of sex crimes,\u201d Apple said.\n\nApple previously regretted that Soares and others were surprised by his charge, saying his office filed the paperwork for review and intended to meet with prosecutors to determine whether a criminal arrest warrant or a criminal summons would be issued.\n\nThe process, however, moved much more quickly than planned, and the information was leaked to the news media, he said.\n\nApple also rejected Cuomo\u2019s accusations of political motivations, saying his office had conducted a \u201ccomprehensive and methodical\u201d investigation.\n\nCuomo, who has maintained his innocence, said he only resigned in order to avoid putting the state through the turmoil that would follow his efforts to fight the charges.\n\nIf convicted on the misdemeanor charge, he would face a possible sentence of up to a year in jail.",

          "text": "Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied any link with the 21-storey building that collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos on Monday, saying he has no interest whatsoever in the said property.\n\nThe Vice President, in a statement issued on Friday by his Media Assistant, Laolu Akande, noted that all his property had been documented in the asset declaration form \u201cwhich is in the public domain,\u201d and commiserated with the families of those who lost their lives in the incident.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Lagos State Government revealed that 38 bodies had been recovered from the collapsed building, as rescue operation entered Day Four and called on families of the deceased to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba for identification of the corpses.\n\nReports surfaced online linking the Vice-President to the collapsed building\u2019s land, and there were also claims that the said land was sold to Osinbajo by Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, Founder of Elizade Motors.\n\nOsinbajo debunked the reports, and said further that he never intervened with the regulatory authorities in Lagos State to unseal the Ikoyi property at any point.\n\nThe Vice President said he had briefed his lawyers to sue the online medium that linked him to the said property.\n\nOsinbajo added that he has no business or property dealings with the Chairman of Elizade Motors, Chief Michael Ade Ojo and at no time too did he put any call across to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu over the said property.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cVice President Yemi Osinbajo is saddened by the events that occurred in Lagos on Monday, 1st of November 2021, where a high-rise building under construction on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe condoles with the families and relatives of all those who have died, were injured or affected in the collapse. Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlso, the attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\u201d\n\nAde-Ojo: I Didn\u2019t Sell Collapsed Building\u2019s Land to Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of Elizade Motors and Elizade University, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo has said he did not sell the land of the collapsed building in Ikoyi to Osinbajo.\n\nAde-Ojo, who said this in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, however, added that he owns a property adjacent to the collapsed building and that he is not willing to sell it.\n\nDeath Toll Now 38\n\nThe Lagos State Government on Friday said bodies recovered from the Ikoyi collapsed building were ready for identification and called on families to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) Yaba to identify the corpses of their loved ones.\n\nThe state government said 38 bodies had been recovered so far from the collapsed building as rescue operation entered Day Four, while family members had submitted 32 names of those still missing.\n\nLagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, while giving an update to the press, said the bodies would be ready for identification from 4pm Friday.\n\nOmotoso said an autopsy would be carried out on the corpses before releasing them to their families.\n\nHe said recovery work was still ongoing and would continue until the government is able account for everybody inside the building at the time of the collapse and certify that nobody is left behind in the collapsed building.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Soludo, Uba, Ozigbo are Frontrunners as Anambra Votes Amid Fear, Tension",
          "text": "Amid fear and tension, caused by an endless bloodbath, which hindered campaigns of the political parties, the people of Anambra State will on Saturday vote to elect a new governor.\n\nThough, the outlawed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it is not opposed to the poll and has withdrawn its stay-at-home order, there is still palpable fear across the state, with many afraid that terrorists may attack voters. This is certain to affect turnout of voters.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high, with streets deserted, but the police and other security agencies have assured Anambra State voters of maximum security and want them to come out without fear. Indeed, every nook and cranny of the state is heavily policed.\n\nAs part of measures aimed at protecting the election, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 PM yesterday, 5th November, 2021 to 11:59 PM today, 6th November, 2021.\n\nThe IG noted that the restriction had become necessary following pointers from the Election Security Threats Assessments conducted by the Force, \u201cwhich indicate a high likelihood of infiltration by criminally-minded individuals to Anambra State, before, during and after the polls.\u201d\n\nBaba further noted that the measure would also avail security forces a firm grip of the state, to checkmate the movement of political thugs and touts, and prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs throughout the period and beyond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baba sent out a strong warning thus: \u201cWe have identified some more flashpoints, but we can handle that without problem. We have 85 per cent of personnel and assets on ground. Our helicopters are down and we have gun boats to take care of the marines and we know the Navy will assist in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure that there is enough security on ground. We have sent signals to those who want to make trouble not to test our will. Those who tried last weekend had sad stories to tell, if at all they were able to get to their camps.\u201d\n\nThe IG had earlier ordered the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 police personnel and three police helicopters to Anambra State ahead of the election.\n\nThe IG said the 34,587 personnel included conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), special forces personnel, Explosives Ordinance Unit (EOD), Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), Interpol, Special Protection Unit (SPU), as well as police medical teams expected to be on ground to guarantee a hitch-free election.\n\nHe said three police helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance amongst other operational capabilities.\n\nThe Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi yesterday announced the deployment of 20,000 personnel drawn from Anambra State and neighbouring state commands, to assist the police with security for today\u2019s election.\n\nAudi assured the people that the election will hold peacefully and successfully without rancor or acrimony \u201cas the Corps is working in synergy and collaboration with other sister agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, security agencies, sensitive and non-sensitive election materials, INEC permanent and ad-hoc staff and all other apparatuses deployed to ensure a hitch free election.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, earlier appointed as head of the special police team providing security for today\u2019s election, was also removed yesterday without any reason given. Egbunike hails from Anambra State and oversees the five police commands in the South-east\n\nThe new team leader for today\u2019s election is Assistant Inspector General Zaki Ahmed, until now the second in command to DIG Egbunike.\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakub also assured Anambra people of a credible election and security of lives and property.\n\nYakub, who spoke during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the INEC headquarters in Awka on Tuesday, said: \u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice. We have received assurances from the security agencies and they said they are capable of ensuring security for all. On our part, we assure Anambra people it will be free, fair and credible election.\n\nThe Leading Contenders\n\nThough there are 18 candidates on the ballot, in practical terms, there are only three candidates in the race for Anambra governorship today.\n\nThese are Charles Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA); Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThough, there is no written agreement on the rotation of governorship in Anambra State on Senatorial basis, this has in many previous elections determined the emergence of a governor.\n\nThis year, Anambra South is the most favoured for governorship, and all three most popular candidates \u2013 Valentine Ozigbo, Chukwuma Soludo and Andy Uba \u2013 who represent the three major political parties in the race, picked their candidates from that zone.\n\nIncidentally, all three leading candidates also come from Aguata Local Government Area. While the three candidates will be sharing the votes in the zone, their ability to garner votes from the North and Central zones, will guarantee their victory.\n\nOzigbo hails from Amesi in Aguata LGA. His philanthropic gestures and support for sports gave him popularity in his Southern zone, but he also has the advantage of having the support of most top politicians in the central, which will give him an edge.\n\nAs he battles for votes in the Southern zone with other candidates, he has the support of the Central zone through the former governor Peter Obi, who supports his aspiration. He will also enjoy massive votes from supporters of Senator Uche Ekwunife who is also his campaign coordinator. Ozigbo may however not do so well in the Northern zone, as he would have the incumbent governor to contend with.\n\nUba hails also from the Southern zone, Uga in Aguata LGA. He is a veteran politician and has contested for the position many times, and this has given him a lot of popularity. In the Southern zone, Uba is also very popular, but will be splitting his votes in the zone with Soludo and Ozigbo. However, in the North, Uba who has several lieutenants in the zone, including the chairman of his political party and his campaign coordinator, will likely sway votes in his direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Uba has a minus in the Central zone, as the minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who also has a large following in the Central zone, does not support him as a result of the fall-out of the governorship primary election of the party last June.\n\nSoludo, former Central Bank Governor, may not be popular in his own zone, but what he lacks in popularity, his party, which is widely accepted in the state has. He and his party also have high popularity in the Central zone, just as it is expected that his largest number of votes will come from the Northern zone. This is because of the influence of the incumbent governor, who is giving him his unalloyed support, just as federal and state lawmakers in the zone are also in support of Soludo.\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke",

          "title": "Pfizer Says Its Antiviral Pill Slashes Risk of Severe Covid By 89%",
          "text": "Pfizer Inc\u2019s (PFE.N) experimental antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 cut by 89% the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease, the company said on Friday, as its CEO vowed to make this promising new weapon in the fight against the pandemic available globally as quickly as possible.\n\nThe trial\u2019s results suggest that Pfizer\u2019s drug surpasses Merck & Co Inc\u2019s (MRK.N) pill, molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the chance of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients at high risk of serious illness.\n\nPfizer\u2019s pill, with the brand name Paxlovid, could secure U.S. regulatory approval by the end of the year. Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the Nov. 25 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The trial was stopped early due to its high success rate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the U.S. government has secured millions of doses of Pfizer\u2019s drug.\n\n\u201cIf authorized by the FDA we may soon have pills that treat the virus in those who become infected,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe therapy would be another tool in our toolbox to protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID.\u201d\n\nShares in Pfizer, which also makes one of the mostly widely used COVID-19 vaccines, rose 11% to close at $48.61. Merck\u2019s fell 10% to close at $81.61. Shares of vaccine makers took a hit, with Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), Pfizer\u2019s German partner BioNTech SE and Novavax (NVAX.O) all down 11-21%.\n\nPfizer\u2019s pill is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir. The treatment consists of three pills given twice daily. It has been in development for nearly two years.\n\nThe Pfizer and Merck pills are eagerly anticipated, with only limited options currently available for treating people sick with COVID-19. Full trial data is not yet available from either company.\n\nPfizer is in active discussions with 90 countries over supply contracts for its pill, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in an interview.\n\n\u201cOur goal is that everyone in the world would be able to have it as quickly as possible,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nBourla added that for high-income countries Pfizer expects to price its treatment close to where Merck has priced its drug. Merck\u2019s U.S. contract price is around $700 for a five-day course of therapy. For low-income countries, Bourla said Pfizer is considering several options, with the goal of \u201cno barrier for them as well to have access.\u201d\n\nMerck\u2019s pill was approved by British regulators in a world first on Thursday.\n\nEven with the potential offered by the Pfizer and Merck pills, preventing COVID-19 infections through broad use of vaccines remains the best way to control a pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people worldwide, including more than 750,000 in the United States, infectious disease experts said.\n\n\u201cVaccines are going to be the most effective and reliable tool that we have in this pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Grace Lee, professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. \u201cThese oral medications are going to augment our ability to really reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death, which is huge, but it won\u2019t prevent infection.\u201d\n\nWhile more than 7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, that has covered only about half the world\u2019s people. In the United States, 58% of all people, including 70% of adults, are fully vaccinated.\n\nMizuho analyst Vamil Divan forecast a \u201cvery minor impact\u201d from Pfizer\u2019s drug on vaccination among people who do not want the vaccine or a booster shot as recommended by U.S. health regulators.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a small percentage of people that may decide not to get vaccinated now that there are good treatment options,\u201d Divan said.\n\nMANUFACTURING GOALS\n\nPfizer said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of this year and at least 50 million courses by the end of next year, including 21 million in the first half of 2022. Bourla said that, based on the better-than-expected trial results, Pfizer is considering potentially doubling next year\u2019s manufacturing target.\n\nAntivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, to be most effective.\n\nThe planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer\u2019s study examined hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.\n\nAmong those given Pfizer\u2019s drug within three days of symptom onset, the pill lowered the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe COVID-19 by 89% compared to those receiving a placebo. Among these patients, 0.8% were hospitalized and none died by 28 days after treatment, compared to a 7% hospitalization rate and seven deaths in the placebo group.\n\nRates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms: 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared to 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths. Pfizer said that represents 85% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization or death.\n\nTwo other trials \u2013 one in people without underlying risk factors and another in people who have been exposed to the virus but are not yet infected \u2013 are continuing, with those results likely be available in the first quarter of 2022, Bourla said.\n\nPfizer did not detail side any effects but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients. Possible side effects include nausea and diarrhea.",
