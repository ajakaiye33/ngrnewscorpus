          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has been commended for his drive to urbanise rural communities in the state through massive road and drainage construction.\n\nState Commissioner for Works (Highways and Urban) Mr. Noel Omodon gave the commendation while speaking to newsmen recently in his office in Asaba.\n\nHe said that across the nooks and crannies of the state construction work was ongoing geared towards opening up places that were hitherto unreachable.\n\nHe stressed that the state government\u2019s bridge projects were progressing very well adding that most of them would be completed before the end of the Okowa administration.\n\n\u201cGov. Ifeanyi Okowa has distinguished himself in infrastructure delivery including quality roads construction across the state.\n\n\u201cHe is opening up spaces with his urban renewal drive, moving our rural communities from primitive to pre-urban and by extension providing access roads to previously unreachable places.\n\n\u201cAside the providing access roads to rural communities, he also consolidating urban places with bridges, drainages and improving on the aesthetics of the cities to make them more livable.\u201d\n\nOn the Ayakoromo bridge linking Ughelli South to Burutu Local government area, Omodon explained that work is going on well as the contractor had returned to site following a successful review of the project cost.\n\n\u201cAyakoromo is also going very fine we are following that up, it was one of my fear because of Burutu, that road will help us connect Burutu finally and all our local government headquarters will be fully connected when completed.\n\n\u201cI am happy, I talked to some of my people inside Ayakoromo and they reported to me independently of what the contractor has been telling me so I am quite happy.\n\n\u201cAnd then the funding is very good because the governor is quite committed to it. They must complete now because we don\u2019t have anything delaying us again so that we don\u2019t have another reason to start to re-evaluate again so Ayakoromo is coming up.\n\n*Beneku bridge is also coming up very rapidly, I cannot give you a set time now because where we are now, we are about to launch some beams across.\n\n\u201cEvery other thing is ready you know we had to extend the road because we had to lift the bridge higher, the initial ramp could not go so we had to shoot it a bit further, meaning we have to enter the town by another road and that is costing us more.\n\n\u201cWe have done all of that, the culverts are all in place, and they have not started doing the filling. But all the piles, the cross beams are ready, we are casting longitudinal beams and all the few other elements.\n\n\u201cWork is ongoing, I am quite anxious that I need to follow it very closely. The reason I feel so is that I think we are working a thin line with that because it is one of the legacy projects we must deliver before the end of our tenure.\u201d\n\nOn the Orere bridge in Ughelli South, Omodon said the contactor is working very hard to deliver on the project adding that there was some adjustments to the initial design.\n\n\u201cThe Orere bridge is another big one, when they did the first assessment we assumed that the high water mark was a bit low but when they found out that it flooded because as you come in from Ughelli south into the bridge, the areas before are a bit low.\n\n\u201cBut after the rivers the areas are higher so they have done all the piling from that side and all the piling on this side only for us to find out that, that area is a bit low so water could run into our roads so we have to take the bridge back a little.\n\n\u201cAll the piles are now in place, the beams are also being cast, I got a report about that yesterday and the contractor has all the reinforcement he needs.\n\n\u201cThe Orere bridge will be another success story of the Okowa\u2019s administration when it is fully completed hopefully.\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Umusume bridge across River Ethiope in Obiaruku, the Commissioner said work is progressing massively on the project and expressed optimism that it will be completed in by December, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Umusume bridge in Obiaruku is another interesting one. We have a situation where from Obiaruku you run down to the river once you cross the river it is steeper on that side for some funny reason, so we had to make a kind of curve that allows us for a more gentle climb.\n\n\u201cIt is a beautiful site, all the piles are in place, and the launching of the beams will soon start. That one is also ready, I believe that one will be amongst the earliest ones to be completed.\n\n\u201cIt is my dream to have it inaugurated during my time as Commissioner, i have the pleasure of being in the office by God\u2019s grace when the excellent landmark will be achieved and that will make my day that I was a part of that system,\u201d Omodon stated.",

          "title": "Nasir El-Rufai\u2019s succession plan: Who\u2019s the chosen one?",
          "text": "By Abubakar Evuti\n\nWhen former Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said that campaign is done in poetry but governance in prose, he must have been thinking of the hazy days of slogans on steroids which fills supporters with false notion of an easy Eldorado; sweeping majestic visions of all people rising victorious and transforming the state with theories into a new earth. But anybody who knows anything knows that things are not this simple: campaign manifestos are theories, and governance proper is real life work, and only the inordinately idealistic would be so rash as to confuse the two.\n\nI was on Sokoto Road on the day unqualified teachers, holding up exam-is-not-the-true-test-of-knowledge placards, marched down to Sir. Kashim Government House to protest their dismissal after failing the most elementary examination.\n\nIf you were there you would have seen the crowd, a thousand at least, who marched down to the Governor\u2019s office to register their displeasure. But el-Rufai, the son of his father, did not budge! This was on the eve of an election year, with the looming possibility of losing the votes of these disgruntled people, their dependents and their associates.\n\n\u201cWe take decisions because they are right, not because they offer us any political advantage,\u201d el-Rufai responded.\n\nThis is the kind of action that often determines history.\n\nI have often argued that, compared to Lagos, Kaduna State is more difficult to govern because Kaduna does not have as much resources; is by far larger; is nearly as populated and has the burden of religious and tribal crisis.\n\nMallam el-Rufai who became Kaduna\u2019s Governor in 2015 used a number of these considered disadvantages to today better the position of the state with his reforms that were unpopular because he was advancing a departure from the ordinary: investment promotion to attract FDIs and DDIs to enjoy the advantage of a state with high youthful population and land, a not necessarily large but highly efficient civil service is in place, qualified teachers in public schools is now the norm, infrastructure that would last several decades have been erected and the blockade of leakages ensured, all of which have given Kaduna State a sure footing into the future.\n\nHere is the question, as Hausawa would say, that is eating the food in everyone\u2019s calabash: who succeeds el-Rufai; who would continue with the development of the capital of Northern Nigeria by proceeding with the actualization of the Kaduna State Infrastructure and Industrialization Plan well into the year 2030?\n\nIn a democratic dispensation, succession is by worth, not birth, which provides some guarantee for a people to determine their own future and ensure that development of nearly a decade is not disrupted by permitting the incompetent to take over the mantle of leadership. And here is the genius of el-Rufai: even his staunchest detractors would agree that the man leaves nothing to chance. Surely a succession plan is in place.\n\nA number of individuals in the APC, sagacious, articulate and highly experienced, have presented themselves as candidates to continue the work el-Rufai has started. But there is one that appears to standout, whom those who have been paying attention are suspecting is The Chosen One: Muhammad Sani Dattijo.\n\nAnd why not; he is the most colorful of all aspirants and has been in the Executive Council longer than all other aspirants, from 2015 until 2022; a true student of the el-Rufai School of Governance who was central to many developmental projects including the Urban Renewal Project that has put to bed the old saying that should Sardauna return to life (because of a lack of development) would be able to locate his house.\n\nWas Dattijo not the reason why Kaduna was able to present her budget earlier than most allowing the state to plan effectively and commit sufficient resources to pressing sectors like Education and Health? Dattijo ensured implementation of the budget calendar as conceptualized by el-Rufai.\n\nWe are all witnesses, Planning and Budget Commission under Dattijo became a beehive of activities for National and International Development Partners who were blown away by the dynamism of it\u2019s leadership and so elbowed their way forward to collaborate with Kaduna State, a development that inspired other State Governments from all parts of Nigeria to periodically visit for Peer Learning and hands-holding on many how-to -dos for their States\u2019 advancement.\n\nPlus, Dattijo is younger than the others which follows that he is better fit to meet the pressing schedules that the daily toiling of governance of a challenging state like Kaduna requires. His temperament is measured and his respect for all persons, regardless of age or status, is incontestable.\n\nBeing in his 40s, Dattijo is the bridge between the young and the old; he understands and would better relate with the young as well as the old. His age makes him equipped to play basketball at Murtala Square with young boys in the morning, explain government policies on Twitter in the afternoon, and sit through a deliberation in the palace of the Amir of Zazzau in the evening.\n\nHis readiness is beyond question as the man is running the best issue-based campaign Nigeria has never seen, and has since presented to the public a clear Policy Document inviting all stakeholders to understand his vision and make suggestions and contributions.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai himself has spoken very highly of Dattijo, and has demonstrated the trust he has in Dattijo\u2019s capacity by giving him the most challenging responsibilities, including making him the Chief of Staff, entrusting him with conceptualization and implementation of the State Development Plan that was further broken down to Sector Implementation Plans (SIPs)\u2014 the first of it\u2019s kind for the State\u2014 where each sector has it\u2019s own Activity Manual for the production of it\u2019s own budget and it\u2019s effective implementation.\n\nSimilarly, Dattijo brought to life the Infrastructural and Industrial Master plan for Kaduna\u2014the first of it\u2019s kind for the State. Dattijo authored the Kaduna State SDGs Report 2017 which became the first by any subnational in the world to break down every indicator and goal, develop a strategy for it\u2019s implementation and monitoring, which enabled Kaduna become the first subnational to present such report at the UN General Assembly thereby putting Kaduna on the global map!\n\nImpressively, all these policy documents are inter-linked and their implementation must now be sustained. This is how Kaduna can move forward, by insisting on a transition from the master to the student, not only for Kaduna\u2019s sake but for the entire northern region of Nigeria; because, as the capital, when Kaduna sneezes, Northern Nigeria catches a cold.\n\nWith her resources especially the concentration of learning institutions and a large population of young people, Kaduna would lead the way into the future of the North by rescuing our people from the challenges of the past into the contentment of the future. Dattijo understands the dynamics of current global politics and leadership and would tap into his robust network of institutions and individuals globally for the advancement of Kaduna State into the future especially in attracting Foreign Direct Investments and providing support for the people.\n\nNor is his appreciation of ICT in doubt. Dattijo understands the future in the face of the advent of futuristic concepts like crypto-currency, advancement in technology that now holds the promise of the Singularity. More than most he knows that the world is certainly going to change in the next decade and he can see that while industrialisation and infrastructure are a necessary component, innovation is the key to development.\n\nHe is the most equipped to inspire a significant departure from the old thinking which is now imperative to trigger rapid development. Dattijo understands that all of these are a possibility as we are only limited by our imagination for we have seen examples of nations with meager resources and overwhelming challenges move \u201cFrom Third-World To First\u201d.\n\nAvuti wrote in from Kaduna\n\nVanguard News",

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA, has pulled down down over 600 illegal houses in Zamani village along the Airport Road, warning local chiefs against land allocation to people.\n\nTSenior Special Assistant on Monitoring Inspection and Enforcement to the minister of FCT, Attah Ikharo who monitored the exercise, said the minister, Muhammad Musa Bello has been warning chiefs against sharp practices.\n\nHe said; \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t think I can quantify the houses; there are Development Control workers who are taking note but I can say over 600 illegal structures were pulled down.\n\n\u201cThe Minister has issued that warning times without number, they have gone against the urban and regional planning laws. They have violated the law. It costs the administration money, hours and manpower to clear them.\n\n\u201cWe are not paying any compensation because they violated the law building illegal structures. We are not done with Zamani community, we have a city to protect. Someone came to offer bribe and the man spoke a language close to my own I refused, later the indigenous people came and claimed the house is theirs but I said no because someone already came to offer me bribe and I refused.\n\n\u201cThey showed us some houses that were not their own.\n\n\u201cNo chief has right to sell land.

And they didn\u2019t tell us that it was an illegal land. Some people bribed the indigenes, they left some houses. We are fasting. At least in the spirit of Ramadan, they could have left it till after fasting. Now during election they will say we are one, which is a lie\u201d.",

          "text": "SIR: On Friday, April 22, the whole of Southwest was thrown into a somber and forlorn mood over the demise of the great king of Oyo Kingdom, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi lll, the 46th Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nAlaafin\u2019s death at 83 still shocked like one at a tender age. Stumbling on a clip where he was doing boxing exercise, his agility and stamina were more like someone at 40. He punched the bag with vim and vigour, with a mixture of road walk exercise. His fitness corroborated his eulogy as one that death cannot kill or one that cannot be captured by diseases. Amidst other eulogies, these two remain an emblem of strength, virility, and stronghold.\n\nHistory will never forget a king who turns his subject into a gold mine. Alaafin engraved his name on the pages of history where those who made change possible can never be forgotten. He accommodated all and sundry, the medieval and geriatrics, men and women and will never rush to make jabberwocky headlines in the media. His relentless efforts at peaceful coexistence among Yorubas, Southwest, and Nigeria are conspicuous, visible to the blind, and audible to the deaf.\n\nHe came, he saw, he conquered as long-serving Alaafin\u2026the iku baba yeye of Oyo Kingdom.\n\nThe vacuum of Oba Adeyemi\u2019s passing will not only be huge but tedious to be filled. As a top-notch and respected monarch, he knew the value of peace and harmony and handled controversial issues with the touch of diplomacy and pragmatism. He strove to unite the Yoruba race and attempted to settle discord capable of tearing Yorubas apart.\n\nThroughout his reign, Oba Adeyemi never fanned the ember of discord and disunity. He watched his public utterances on matters of national interest, not as a coward, but as a custodian of peace. He knew where to talk tough and where to administer calmness. He loved his people, his subjects, and the Yoruba race under his watch. What a loving king.\n\nSouthwest and particularly, Oyo State in less than six months has witnessed the unpalatable death of royal fathers of notable ancient towns. It is as if the \u2018creme de la creme\u2019 monarchs in Yoruba land had a conclave to bid their subjects farewell intermittently. The rhythm of death is unfriendly. Its gong sounds painful and not sonorous to the ears. It is a pity.\n\nDecember 2021, the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi Ajagungbade lll joined his ancestors at age of 95 years after reigning for 48 years and 22 days. Then in January, Oba Olubadan followed suit, and a few months later, the Alaafin joined. The rampage of death of top-notch monarchs in the southwest, Oyo State will create a great vacuum; their gourd of deep rooted knowledge, wisdom, understanding of rich history, culture, the landmass of Yoruba kingdoms will be missed.\n\nOlubadan, Soun, and Alaafin have tried their best and left the rest; they should inform Awolowo, Akintola, and others that their children are still at loggerheads for the presidential ticket\u2026 Tell Baba Awo that Yorubas are still in caucus; not in unity.\n\nMay your souls continue to rest in peace\u2026The tree irokos of the Yoruba kingdom.",

The former president encouraged the aspirants to resolve within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one of them.\n\nBut General Babangida opted for inclusion through wider consultations and assigned one of the elder statesmen in the North, Prof Ango Abdullahi, to design some criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\nOut of the four aspirants, Bauchi governor and former Senate president emerged as preferred choices, but Tambuwal rejected the outcome claiming that the Northern leaders did not follow due process.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern elderstatesman and former Vice Chancellor, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Professor Ango Abdullahi, has said zoning of the presidency is dead and buried.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nTo this end, he called on political parties to forget zoning of presidency to a particular region\n\nHe advised that those seeking to contest for the Presidency should be allowed to do so on the merit of their competence and not where they come from.\n\nHe added that such positions should be left open for standard norms of democratic processes.\n\nProfessor Abdullahi, who is the Convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) stated this at his Zaria residence while reacting to the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) leadership who paid him a visit.\n\nThe elder statesman who disclosed that over 11 presidential aspirants which cut across various political parties have visited him in Zaria for his candid advice, prayers and support, adding that, election of who becomes President of Nigeria should be left open and winner allowed to emerge regardless of where he or she comes from.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning or power shift is dead and buried, candidates should be allowed to contest election on the basis of merit of their competence and not where they come from, hence the Northern Elders Forum is of the opinion that the presidential position should be left open for standard norms of democractic process.\u201d\n\nOn the controversial PDP consensus process that produced Saraki from North Central and Governor Mohammed from North East, he said: \u201cThe aspirants insisted on us choosing from among them but we told them it was not possible, so we consulted elders from across the North West, North Central and North East before Tambuwal and Atiku Abubakar withdrew from the process.\n\n\u201cAll elders voted for first and second choice and Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed tied and both of them were asked to either pick one among themselves or do further consultation on the best among them and our recommendation was signed by me as Ango Abdullahi and not onbehalf of NEF, a position I made very clear at a press conference I addressed in Minna\u201d.\n\nWhile lamenting leadership failure in the country, he challenged any one to a debate on the state of the nation, stressing that, \u201cwhat is killing us is self serving\u201d.\n\nEarlier, spokesperson of the CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman said: \u201cWe, at the CNG, will continue to look up to you as a great statesman, a mentor, a guardian, a living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe finally urge you to remain steadfast in providing leadership advice for strong resistance to the antics of these political dealers desperately seeking to market the worst, unproductive, inefficient individuals with no record of credence in all their endeavours on the people as candidates from the North.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says publishing governor\u2019s character flaws in public interest\n\nBlessing Ibunge\n\n\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the suit by Governor Nyesom Wike against THISDAY newspaper and others on alleged libel yesterday, the defense witness, Mr. Jude Igbanoi, presented more video evidences to show the unreliability of the state governor.\n\nThe video further showed that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was not libelous. Igbanoi also rejected the assertion by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the publication was reckless, insisting that the publication was fair comment on a matter of public interest.\n\nThe court watched video of Wike as the Director General of Godwin Obaseki Campaign Organisation campaigning for Obaseki\u2019s re-election and saying good things about Obaseki only to turn round a few years later to be attacking his character. The court also watched video clips of Wike as the Director General of Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s campaign organisation, where he was praising the former governor of Rivers State to high heaven only for him to change and started attacking him which THISDAY argued buttresses his (Wike\u2019s) unreliability.\n\nDuring the cross examination, the witness, Igbanoi, argued that the publication by THISDAY did not make Wike\u2019s political associates and friends to shun or abandon him. The publication did affect his relationships and did not make him lose any privilege or opportunities that would have come his way. He was appointed Director General of Obaseki Campaign Organisation despite the publication an indication that the publication clearly did not injure his public perception.\n\nThe court at the end of the cross examination of the first witness for the defendant adjourned till May 20, to begin cross examination of the second witness.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY outside the courtroom, the defense counsel, Tuduru Edeh, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, explained that: \u201cThe sitting yesterday concentrated on playing exhibit F and L, which were videos namely where Wike was campaigning for Amaechi as his campaign director for his governorship election and he praised Amaechi to high heavens.\n\n\u201cIt was played to demonstrate that, that was the position he had, but it is a different story today having fallen out with Amaechi.\n\n\u201cThe first video was to show that even though the man claimed libels but going through the videos you see a man who was made Director General of Obaseki\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nEdeh added that: \u201cThe witness emphasised that he (Wike) was not shunned, political associates did not abandon him as a result of the publication he is complaining about.\n\n\u201cThe matter was adjourned till May 20 for continuation of hearing, for us to bring our second witness.\u201d\n\nJustice Adolphus Enebeli of the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, adjourned till May 20, 2022 to continue hearing on the suit.\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the matter, the lead counsel to Wike, Emmanuel Ukala, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, put to the witness for the defendant that the publication made by THISDAY was reckless and could negatively affect the image of the claimant.\n\nLast month, the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had also watched video clips tendered by THISDAY. Then, in the video clips presented by Igbanoi and played in the courtroom, he had in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements opened his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments. He had argued that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion suit against THISDAY and three of its staff, claiming that the newspaper publication of June 23, 2020, with caption:\u201dWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\nThe governor had claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\nWike had also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Not that this was planned. But, as usual, such a gathering always affords us the opportunity to critically look at the state of the nation, particularly, now being an election season. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 all networking and programming for the 2023 elections,\u201d said one of the political leaders, who is also in Saudi for Umrah.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Prohibits payment of ransom to kidnappers\n\n\u2022Amendment aims to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks\n\n\u2022To align with the required standard as obtainable in other jurisdictions\n\n\u2022NDLEA wants political parties to include drug test in screening process for aspirants\n\n\u2022Umar urges FG to ensure immediate release of kidnapped victims of Kaduna-bound train attack\n\nMichael Olugbode, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\n\n\nAs part of efforts to avert the imminent placement of Nigeria in the International Cooperation and Review Group Process of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its looming sanctions on the economy, the Senate yesterday passed a bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, as well as prohibit payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nThat was as former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of passengers abducted by terrorists during the Kaduna train attack. Umar made the appeal in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nThe passage of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nChairman of the committee, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central), explained, \u201cThe need to comprehensively review the Terrorism Prevention Act arose from the unfavourable ratings of FATF recommendations of Nigeria\u2019s Mutual Evaluation Report and consequent placement of Nigeria in FATF\u2019s International Cooperation and Review Group Process with its impending sanctions on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the National Task Force on improving Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in Nigeria had proposed improvement on the Act in order to address the deficiencies noted in its provisions and align it with the required standard obtainable in other jurisdictions.\n\nTwo months ago, the federal government disclosed that it had uncovered 123 companies and 96 other entities linked to terrorism financing. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the companies included 33 Bureaux De Change (BDC). Mohammed also stated that the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit uncovered the suspected companies and individuals.\n\nThe companies, which were alleged to be conduit for movement of money by terrorists, are yet to be tried by the federal government.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been increasing attacks by different terrorist groups across the country, with several lives lost, scores injured, and many kidnapped or missing and unaccounted for.\n\nCurbing terrorism financing has remained a hard nut to crack for the Nigerian government either due to lack of political will or gaps in legislation. This has exacerbated insecurity and fear, what with the attempted attack on the Kaduna airport, attack on a Kaduna-bound train, and attack on security personnel and formations, all recently, as well as other nefarious activities by terrorist groups.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Derivatives Company Limited revealed that in the past decade, an estimated 87,903 persons had died through assaults by Boko Haram, sectarian actors, and other armed bandits in the country, with a lot of Nigerians now living in fear.\n\nBamidele, in his presentation, said the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, sought to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers, and terrorists for release of any person who had been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cThe overall import of this bill is to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom in Nigeria, which is fast spreading across the country.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the memoranda presented to the committee, a plethora of issues relating to terrorism and terrorism financing, in line with global best practices, were raised. He assured that the amendment to the terrorism law would set standards and the regulatory system intended to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks.\n\nBamidele added, \u201cHaving policies in place to combat financing of terrorism will surely reduce or eliminate privacy and anonymity in financial and other sundry transactions as it relates to the subject in our society.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the proposed repeal and enactment bill was geared towards improving the effectiveness of countermeasures against terrorism, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.\n\nThe senator noted that the repeal was aimed at providing adequate framework for improved international collaboration, inter-agency cooperation, and freezing of terrorist funds/assets.\n\nBamidele stated, \u201cThe passage of this bill will save Nigeria from being included among countries in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List with its attendant negative consequences, which might ultimately result to international sanctions that would affect the image of the country in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said it would complement the federal government\u2019s efforts in the fight against insecurity, when signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLawan said, \u201cIt is our belief here in the Senate that this bill, by the time signed into an Act by Mr. President, will enhance the efforts of this government in the fight against terrorism, kidnapping, and other associated and related vices.\n\n\u201cThis is one piece of legislation that can turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have done so much as a government, in terms of infrastructural development across all parts of this country, but because the security situation is not the kind of situation that we all want, this tends to overshadow all the tremendous and massive developments in our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the executive will waste no time in signing this bill into law, and it is our hope that this additional piece of legislation will achieve the purpose for which it has been worked upon by the Senate, and, indeed, the National Assembly, and for which it would also be signed by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear here, that the fight against insecurity, whether it is kidnapping, terrorism or whatsoever, is not the sole role of a government.\n\n\u201cThe contribution and support by citizens is essential, because our security agencies need vital and critical information against terrorism and other things that make life difficult for us.\u201d\n\nThe upper chamber passed the bill after it scaled Third Reading on the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate, thereafter, adjourned plenary till May 10, for the Sallah break.\n\nNDLEA Wants Political Parties to Include Drug Test in Screening Process for Aspirants\n\nAlso, the Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd.), yesterday urged political parties to make drug integrity test part of the screening requirements for aspirants seeking to contest political offices on their platforms in the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement quoted Marwa to have said this during the 2022 First Quarter Best Performing Commands Awards ceremony, held at the agency\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Marwa, \u201cFor politicians, we have long advocated and I take the opportunity again to repeat the advocacy that when they run for public office it demands a lot of responsibility from the person and we need to be certain if he\u2019s a person that is already a drug addict/user who will spend all the money he\u2019s given for public service to consume cocaine and his head will not be in a stable condition to handle the affairs he has been entrusted with.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we have advocated and will continue to advocate that drug test be conducted for politicians; some state governments, like Kano State, is already doing this.\n\n\u201cNot just politicians, but government appointees, and I\u2019ve just sent a letter this morning to the National Chairman of APC, who will be the first of the National Working Committee (members) I wish to pay an advocacy visit on this issue.\n\n\u201cI recommended that drug tests be incorporated in the screening process for all those interested in running for public office; we will do the same to the PDP and other important parties.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing officers and men of the agency present at the event, Marwa said the ceremony \u201chas become part and parcel of our corporate culture. Recognising and rewarding hard work and excellence has always been a pragmatic way of stimulating productivity and enhancing the attainment of organisational goals; making it a tradition for the agency is our way of enshrining meritocracy in the system.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that statistics from the first quarter (Q1) report indicated, \u201cour performance level has not dropped off.\u201d\n\nMarwa said, \u201cIndeed, achieving 3, 539 arrests, 677 convictions, and seizures of 65, 916 kilogrammes of drugs in three months is no mean feat. Little wonder our performance continually earns the agency deserved accolades from the right quarters within the country as well as from abroad, especially from international partners and peers. While we have not yet achieved the utopia of a drug-free society, the results showed that we are getting it right.\u201d\n\nHe told the officers that the awards and commendations were expected to spur them to surpass their current feats at the next ceremony.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe ceremony should be a poignant reminder for us not to forget where we are coming from. And there is no better way to say it other than for us to be mindful of the saying that success has a hundred fathers, but failure is always an orphan. No organisation would understand this adage better than NDLEA in the light of our past rock bottom experience.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we should all be mindful that we hold the fate of NDLEA in our hands, and that fate will be determined by our patriotism and dedication to duty, as well as our collective resolve to work towards the attainment of the agency\u2019s mandate.\u201d\n\nMarwa told the officers and men to continue to propagate the agency\u2019s War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) programme in their various commands.\n\n\u201cThere is much we can achieve when our communities are working hand-in-hand with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHighlighting the strong emphasis on collaboration with all stakeholders, in the agency\u2019s roadmap, the NDCMP 2021-2025, the NDLEA chief executve stated, \u201cWe have to woo members of society to work with us on this very important assignment. Therefore, I charge you to ensure that WADA is correctly and deeply entrenched in the spheres of operation of your respective commands.\u201d\n\nUmar Urges FG to Ensure Immediate Release of Kidnapped Victims of Kaduna Train Attack\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, yesterday, Umar said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, remained disturbing.\n\nUmar also appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.\u201d\n\nOn March 28, terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train and killed eight people, while several others were injured. Many people were abducted and are being held in captivity by the terrorists.\n\nOne of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack on the Kaduna bound train had been delivered of her baby, THISDAY reported yesterday.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62.\n\nThe gunmen had ambushed the train heading for Kaduna from the nation\u2019s capital after bombing its rail track.\n\nARISE Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, had quoted the terrorists as insisting that they were not after a ransom, but exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were allegedly in government custody.\n\nThe TV station further quoted a family source as confirming that one of the two pregnant women among the kidnapped victims had given birth in the terrorists\u2019 den with the help of doctors invited by the gang.\n\nSources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development that is still shocking to both the government and security operatives.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Extends Tenure Of Nigeria Immigration Service Boss, Isah Jere, Despite Attaining Retirement Age",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the extension of the tenure of the Acting Controller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service, Isah Idris Jere.\n\n\n\nThe NIS boss, whose official retirement date was April 24, 2022 (last Sunday) having attained the age of 60 as stipulated by civil service rules, will now continue to preside over the affairs of the agency for one more year following the latest development.\n\nDespite being fully aware of Jere's status as already being pencilled down for retirement last week, President Buhari, like in the past, ignored all laid down rules to unlawfully elongate his tenure, thereby denying other officers in the NIS a chance to move up the ladder.\n\n\n\nIn a letter dated April 22, 2022, and addressed to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, announced the approval of the extension of Jere's tenure with immediate effect.\n\nThe letter read, \"I write in reference to your correspondence dated March 15, 2022 on the above subject matter and wish to inform you that Mr President has approved a one-year extension for the Ag.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nMy day didn\u2019t start well for me yesterday. A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

While the sale has not been finalised, some changes in the European Union could affect its business.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we discussed possible changes following the Digital Services Act, NFT scams, and African agritech inventions.\n\nBeginning with news of the passage into law of the Digital Services Act, we discussed the implications of stricter controls on tech companies. I argued that while the restrictions on targeted advertising would impact advertising revenue for these companies, it is too early to tell how much of an impact it would be.\n\nWith the law not immediately coming into force, it would be interesting to see how tech companies adapt to these changes.\n\nWe moved on to the $2 million NFT scam on the Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s Instagram account. If this fuels your distrust or reluctance to get on the web3 train, Bolu says not to worry, as it was an Instagram account that was hacked.\n\nRegardless, there will be more attempts as web3 technologies catch on, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Meanwhile, you can get early bird tickets to learn all about blockchain technologies at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit on May 21, 2022 by registering here.\n\nPS: Early bird tickets stop on Saturday, April 30, 2022.\n\nWe closed with news of Ghanaian agritech startup, Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A funding. Farmerline\u2019s Mergdata uses its proprietary technology to predict the needs of farmers, which agribusinesses use to distribute farming inputs and knowledge to farmers. Oluwanifemi expressed optimism that more agritech solutions will be funded in the future, and we agreed that this could become the norm as financial services on the continent improve.\n\nYou can always get today\u2019s episode and previous episodes on your favourite podcasts, including Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, and Spotify.

The first of its kind auction was well received by its diverse community of collectors, with the 6-months lease of two artworks by iconic African artists with their works going for $1,185.19 and $1,128.75, respectively.\n\nThe ARTSPLIT app allows its users to own fractions, also known as \u201cSplits,\u201d of prominent African artworks and keep or trade them on the app if they win in the \u201cSplit Auction.\u201d\n\nThese Splits enable multiple individuals to co-own a single iconic piece of art, which is not possible on any other art platform. ARTSPLIT also allows users to participate in a \u2018Lease Auction\u2019 on the app to win physical custody of these split artworks for a set period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\u201d (2014) by Abdoulaye \u2018Aboudia\u2019 Diarrassouba\n\nThe two artworks that were auctioned were \u201cUntitled\u201d (2014) by Abdoulaye \u2018Aboudia\u2019 Diarrassouba, an Ivorian contemporary artist, and \u201cA Still Life of Fruit with A Spanish City Beyond\u201d (1962) by the late prominent South African artist, Irma Stern. Both works had been up for auction from Monday, the 18th of April and were due to close by midnight Friday, April 22, 2022. A flurry of late bids by enthusiastic users looking to outbid each other ensured an exciting finish to a competitive auction! For the excited winners, they will have the works delivered to them for the duration of the lease period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA Still Life of Fruit with A Spanish City Beyond\u201d (1962)\n\nAboudia chronicles the street scene in his city of Abidjan. In his vibrant, large-scale mixed-media paintings and drawings, inspired from the aesthetics of graffiti and traditional African carvings. For Irma Stern, one of South Africa\u2019s most outstanding artists. Africa was her \u201cParadise,\u201d which inspired her artistic creativity.\n\nThe success of the lease auction is another inspiring milestone for ARTSPLIT. It demonstrates the importance of democratizing ownership of prestigious African artworks, with ARTSPLIT granting this access to a global community of art lovers. Another significance of the success of the auctions is proof of the impressive acceptance and adoption ARTSPLIT has garnered from the art community across regions and nationalities, driving the integration of African art into the global art landscape.\n\nHannatu Ageni-Yusuf, ARTSPLIT\u2019s Global Head of Marketing and Communications, stated, \u201cIt has been over a week since we began our soft launch, and the reception has exceeded our expectations.\u201d We are currently gathering feedback from our early users to improve the app\u2019s offerings. Collectors have so far been captivated by the catalogue feature, which allows major collectors to create a digital catalogue of their collection with a planned AI feature that will provide an indicative valuation of these works based on trade data.\u201d\n\nThe excitement does not stop here; there are still amazing artworks up for split and lease auctions on the platform. These auctions are always available and take place in real-time.\n\nYou can download ARTSPLIT HERE on the Android Play Store or iOS app store, sign up and start buying and trading with as little as $10 and become a co-owner and gain physical custodianship of any of the artworks up for auction.\n\nHello and welcome to the new ART ECONOMY!\n\nAbout ARTSPLIT\n\nARTSPLIT Limited is an art trading technology company driven by one common goal: Raising African Art\u2019s global profile by building a diverse community of African art collectors and investors.

Be rest assured that, as a government, we will continue to support your efforts along this line.\u201d\n\nMembers of the SGWF include the first ladies of Edo, Osun, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Abia, Ogun, Ekiti, Delta, Lagos and Oyo States.\u201d\n\nObaseki said, \u201cProtection of rights is key to our administration as we have committed lots of resources to this. We already have a budget planning for gender-based violence (GBV) in our budget this year. We will continue to pull in resources to support the GVB centers across the 18 local government areas in Edo State.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is gender sensitive, Obaseki noted that he appointed eight female commissioners as a part of his cabinet.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe don\u2019t play with gender issues in Edo State. We are in line with what the SGWF represents as the group. They represent unity in Nigeria. Despite the divide in our political outlook, you continue to work very closely as if there is no divide. It\u2019s significant for the unity of this country. If there is anything we need the most today, it is the unity of the country. You represent unity; you epitomize unity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNarrating some of the government\u2019s efforts in tackling gender-based violence in the state, Obaseki added, \u201cWe were worst hit several years ago when a young lady, Vivian Ogu, was murdered in the state on the account of sexual violence. We were also united to condemn the act on the murder of Omozuwa Uwaila, who was also sexually abused and murdered.\n\n\u201cThe state understands the pain the victims and their families go through. As a state, we have zero tolerance for sexual based violence in the state.\u201d\n\nHe further noted, \u201cOur EdoBEST programme is to make sure our pupils learn and get knowledge while going to school. We will continue to emphasize girl-child education.\n\n\u201cAlso, we are focusing on drug abuse. As a state, we are collaborating with relevant agencies to stem the rising tide of drug abuse.\u201d\n\nOn checking food insecurity, the governor stated, \u201cOur country is going through a trying and difficult time following the amount of increase in food prices in Nigeria in the last two months. This has thrown millions of Nigerians into hunger as people are being pushed into hunger. You must raise your voices to enable us to address this issue like we have done with gender-based violence and drug abuse in states.\n\n\u201cWe should put pressure on federal authorities that rather than subsidising petrol, we should move the subsidy to food so that people can eat well. We call on our mothers to join us so that we can prioritize the issue of food in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNoting that the fight against gender-based violence has achieved remarkable progress, the Chairman Nigeria Governors Wife Forum (NGWF), Orelu Bisi Adeleye Fayemi said, \u201cThe group thanked our husbands under the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) for their support and encouragement given to the NGWF on tackling gender- based violence in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMrs. Oyetola on her part commended the governor of Edo State for his developmental strides in the state, especially in education and human capacity development, adding, \u201cYour Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda is quite inspiring and it\u2019s transforming lives already in the state.\u201d\n\nAlso, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki said the NGWF has shown capacity to promote unity in the country, urging governors to support women in their states to run for elective positions.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that the current security challenges in Nigeria were a threat to the foundations of the country\u2019s nationhood.\n\nThe Speaker, however, noted that the Nigerian Government has responded to the challenges by taking certain measures such as increasing funding for the police and the military, recruiting personnel for security agencies, among others.\n\nA statement by the media adviser to the Speaker, Lanre Lasisi, said Gbajabiamila spoke when he delivered a paper titled, \u2018Democracy in Challenging Times: The Role of African Parliaments in Safeguarding and Delivering on the Dividends of Democracy\u2019 at the School of Oriental Studies, London on Wednesday as part of his ongoing official visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nSpeaking on the challenges facing Nigeria, Gbajabiamila said: \u201cThe most pressing of these challenges today is the national security crisis that threatens the foundations of our nationhood and portends great danger for Africa and the world if it persists.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker, however, said: \u201cFirst, to address present challenges and then to build resilient institutions that can withstand uncertainty in troubled times, more than anything else, our focus must remain on the young and vibrant youth of Nigeria and Africa who have so much to offer the world and who have proven that they can thrive under challenging circumstances given half a chance.\n\n\u201cHowever we cannot do this for as long as our present national security challenges persist.\n\n\u201cThe government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has responded to the reality of our present challenges by increasing funding provisions for the police and armed forces, accelerating recruitment and training to put more boots on the ground and also acquiring weapons systems designed to give the security agencies an advantage.\u201d\n\nHe said upon the resumption of the 9th House, \u201cthe scope of our challenges was evident, matched only by our confidence that we would do what was required to overcome those difficulties and deliver the dividends of democracy for our people.\n\n\u201cNow the topic of this paper speaks to \u2018dividends of democracy,\u2019 a term that has been loosely and broadly interpreted to mean different things to different people but what exactly does it mean or what is a universally aceptable definition of the phrase dividends of democracy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor me and the House, we understood that the best dividend of democracy is a just society, where individual rights are recognised and respected. Where citizens have the freedom to dream big dreams and the social resources and infrastructure to achieve those dreams.\n\nGbajabiamila noted that such moments create opportunities \u201cfor positive change, for righting wrongs and establishing new protocols better suited to the reality of the times than whatever existed before.\n\nMotivated by these understandings, the Speaker added, for the first time in the history of the Nigerian legislature, the 9th House began by developing a legislative agenda to articulate in detail \u201cour governing priorities and the specific actions we intended to meet those priorities.\u201d\n\nHe said as the House was moving quickly to implement its agenda, the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, forcing certain drastic measures, including a reworking of the Legislative Agenda.\n\n\u201cWe proposed landmark legislation to reform our public health emergency response system and update our public vaccination protocols. We received heavy criticism for these efforts, as a spirited disinformation campaign suggested malicious intent behind our actions.\n\n\u201cBarely a year later, the rest of the world caught up to the problems we foresaw and sought to prevent and have gone on to enact the same vaccine mandates for which we were then roundly criticised.\n\n\u201cIn addition to refocusing our local priorities, Covid-19 reminded us in parliament of the indispensability of international collaboration in seeking solutions to shared problems. It is an unfortunate reality that despite the similarities of our governance challenges across the continent, there often aren\u2019t enough coordinated efforts to share ideas, jointly consider solutions and adopt best practices to address our shared problems,\u201d he added.\n\nGbajabiamila said with the support of his other colleagues across the African continent, \u201cI convened the first Conference of Speakers of African Parliaments (CoSAP) as a platform for continental parliamentary cooperation and coordination that will allow us to try to change this dynamic.\n\n\u201cAlready, the conference is participating in a broad partnership to renegotiate the terms of our national debts and free up much-needed resources for development whilst committing to a new regime of responsible administration of public resources.\u201d\n\nHe said the Nigerian House of Representatives would this year host the inaugural in-person meeting of CoSAP to establish a framework of action to ensure the achievement of the objectives that motivated this unique partnership.\n\n\u201cAs in most of Africa, Parliament in Nigeria is designed on the basic premise that the legislative function is entirely to make laws and perform periodic oversight to ensure that the Executive implements the laws. This is an outdated model that fails to reflect the public expectation of parliament or the value that parliament and parliamentarians can bring to governance in a differently designed system,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Kogi state governor and one of the presidential aspirants of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Yahaya Bello, Wednesday said all ethics, rules and regulation of the party were in his favour, and therefore not afraid of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s entrance into the race.\n\nGovernor Bello stated this while picking the party\u2019s N100 million Expression of Interest and Nomination forms at the Muhammadu Buhari House of the APC National Secretariat in Abuja.\n\nSimilarly, Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, also obtained the forms to contest for the nation\u2019s top job on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nAnd as the two presidential aspirants were obtaining the forms, about $75,000 was stolen within the premises of the party\u2019s national secretariat in the midst of a mammoth crowd of aspirants and their supporters.\n\nThe incident, according to Blueprint\u2019s findings, happened when an unidentified chieftain of the party was struggling to gain entrance into the premises of the Buhari House at the main gate of the secretariat located at 40 Blantyre Street, Wuse 11 Wednesday morning.\n\nIn the process, it was further gathered, his GSM phone and the brown envelope containing the money fell off him, following which an unidentified person in the crowd picked them up and disappeared.\n\nAn eyewitness told our correspondent that the party chieftain who lost the money was seen shouting and running helter-skelter without getting any attention from anybody.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the incident led to the dismantling of tents arranged for the party officials in charge of the nomination forms, and their subsequent relocation to the International Conference Centre (ICC) for the continuation of the sale of forms.\n\nBello speaks\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after picking the forms, Governor Bello promised to unite and secure the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians are happy and the party is happy. Right now, what we have ahead of us is the task of canvassing and consulting all party faithful, leaders, stalwarts, members and even all Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora. Give us your support to emerge as the flag bearer of this great party come 30th and 31st of May 2023 and by the grace of God, I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table and restoring hope to entire Nigeria and the entire black race, Africa, as a continent and the entire black people across the world. That is the hope we are bringing on board to unite, to secure, and to put our country and its people on the path of progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to speak about the alleged plot to adopt former President Jonathan as the consensus candidate of APC, Bello said: \u201cThat is the beauty of democracy. In democracy, anybody can support anyone but I am assuring you that our great party, the APC is a party that has its own ethics, rules and regulations and I know surely that all of these are in my favour and I am not in any way scared of the pedigree of anyone whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI am confident that I am in the majority, I have the women, I have the youth, I have the people living with disabilities and they are all behind me. I have leaders, I have followers and above all, I have God Almighty.\u201d\n\nNwajiuba\n\nAlso speaking, a House of Representatives member, Hon. Chidi N. Wogu, who picked the forms on behalf of the minister, described the presidential aspirant as one of the oldest and most reliable politicians.\n\n\u201cNot oldest in terms of age, he\u2019s actually a young person. And you can see a young group who are supporting him. This is actually a young group because of the not-too-young-to-run act.\n\n\u201cThe president promised that this time around anyone who is going to run for presidency must be under 60 and these young people come together. When I saw their seriousness, I decided to coordinate with one group we put together the money and we have come today to show the seriousness by being the first to purchase this form and they find him credible, they find him hardworking,\u201d Wogu said.\n\nJonathan gets ultimatum\n\nMeanwhile, days after the Youths Network for Nigeria Union (YNNU) urged former President Jonathan to declare for the 2023 presidency, the group has handed the former president a seven- day ultimatum after Sallah to join the APC and declare his ambition or face over 20,000 youths who will picket his office.\n\nMembers of the pro-Jonathan group who turned up in their numbers Wednesday at a rally in Suleja, Niger state, threatened not to vacate the ex-president\u2019s office if he fails to concede to their demand, adding that the future of Nigerian youths depends on his decision.\n\nChairman of the group, Ibrahim A. Saiki, while addressing the media at the rally said: \u201cYou may recall that on Friday, 22nd April, 2023, we led over 7,500 members of our Network to \u2018a private meeting\u2019 with former President Goodluck Jonathan, urging him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhile responding to our plea, former President Jonathan urged the youths of Nigeria to get more involved in politics and asked us to \u201cwatch out\u201d his next move.\n\n\u201cSince then, the media space has been awash with reactions to ex-President Jonathan\u2019s comments, with several persons giving different interpretations. To us in YNNU, what Nigeria needs at this period of our national life is a unifier. That unifier is President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we have been mandated to, most respectfully, urge President Goodluck Jonathan to immediately progress to pick a membership form of the All-Progressives Congress, APC, from his ward in Otuoke, Bayelsa State, within seven days after Ramadan.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of seven days after Ramadan, President Goodluck Jonathan remains undecided, we shall most respectfully repeat our visit to his office for a Second meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan. It should be noted that over 20,000 of our more than 500,000-strong members across the nation have expressed the unreserved desire to participate and encamp at ex-President Jonathan\u2019s private office, and we shall remain there for as long as it may take for him to decide.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of our position, we have written President Goodluck Jonathan a letter to this effect, which was acknowledged and received by his office yesterday, April 26th, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe earnestly hope that President Goodluck Jonathan fully understands that our future depends on his decision. Therefore, we do not intend to relent in our pursuit of the true desire of Nigerians at this time- which only him can anchor.\u201d\n\nSome of the placards been displayed at the rally was emphatic on their demands. They include; \u2018Jonathan you are wasting our time\u2019, \u2018Maigidan Goodluck Jonathan, our destiny in your hand\u2019, \u2018President Jonathan declare for President Now\u2019, \u2018Goodluck Jonathan You must run\u2019, \u2018We don\u2019t care about party, any party is Ok\u2019, \u2018Jonathan run under APC Now\u2019 etc.\n\nAlso speaking, the secretary of the youth network Jonathan Akumobi and Women Leader, Mrs. Ozi-Bello Sadiq said they had been protesting since morning because they wanted Jonathan to understand the urgency of their request and the need to answer them without further delay.\n\nAccording to Akumobi, \u201cGoodluck Jonathan is a custodian of freedom of speech; he is a man with good heart. When he was the president the economy was good, the youths were employed and Nigeria was in the right direction that is why we are urging him to run.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need person not very old as president\u2019\n\nIn a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Forum of former Ministers, has insisted that the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer in the 2023 election should not be very old.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Forum while hosting the former Senate President and PDP presidential aspirant, Senator Pius Anyim, recently in Abuja, chairman of the forum and former Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Tanimu Turaki (SAN) lamented that leadership failure had affected development of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need a person that is not very old. He (Anyim) has acquired sufficient experience and maturity and he is not also very young. So, he can relate with some of us that are young.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that has the courage to take decisive decisions because Nigerian needs a very strong and powerful president. We need a man of integrity, a person that will listen, a person that will be compassionate, a person that will show sympathy and empathy to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe greatest problem we have had in this country is leadership failure because leadership has failed in this country and because the head of the fish is rotten; ultimately and quite invariably, the body of the fish will also be rotten.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that we must take special interest in what happens to our party in the build up to this election. We will play a very active role, we will liaise with the leadership of the party in selecting a credible candidate that will win election for us and win election for Nigeria and in the process, salvage Nigerians from the twin evils of hunger and poverty.\u201d\n\nTuraki, who stressed that Nigeria needed Anyim\u2019s experience, added: \u201cBetween the experience you have gathered both from the legislative and executive arms of government and of course while you have never had the opportunity of heading or playing a pivotal role in the judiciary; your qualification as a senior lawyer now fills that gap and makes you one person that has the opportunity of gravitating and serving from both arms of government in this country.\u201d\n\nAddressing the former ministers, Anyim, who was also a Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said he had the required experience to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I worked as a civil servant, it was in two parastatals in the Presidency. I worked as President of the Senate, working along with the President to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cI worked as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the engine room of the Presidency. My experiences are cognate. I am not going to learn on the job; I am going to continue from where we stopped.\n\n\u201cLet me also say that today in Nigeria, we are concerned about things that are not going well. There is insecurity, there is economic downturn. The first commitment I want to offer Nigerians is to stand on the framework of consensus and reunite Nigerians and reduce mutual suspicion,\u201d he pledged.\n\n\u201cWhen we are able to redirect the nation on the path of unity and eliminate mutual suspicion, all of us will come together, pick the right hands based on competence and capacity and work together to refocus the economy, rescue the country and rebuild our society.\u201d\n\nPresent at the meeting were Elder Godsday Orubebe, Labaran Maku, Solomon Ewuga, Sanusi Dagash and Josephine Anenih.\n\nOthers included Ina Ciroma, Mukhtar Shehu Shagari and Osita Chidoka among others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "A Makurdi High Court in Benue State has acquitted Andrew Ogbuja, a lecturer at the Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo, accused of raping and causing the death of Ochanya Ogbanje, a 13-year-old schoolgirl, in 2018.\n\nJustice Augustine Ityonyiman acquitted Ogbuja of the charges filed against him on Wednesday while delivering judgment on the case at the court in the state capital.\n\nOgbuja and his son, Victor, who are both maternal relations of the victim, were accused of serially raping her until she fell ill and subsequently died.\n\nOchanya was admitted to the Federal Medical Centre in Makurdi for two months before she died on October 17, 2018.\n\nOn October 10, 2019, the Benue State government arraigned 54-year-old Ogbuja before the Makurdi High Court on four counts of rape and Ochanya\u2019s death.\n\nThe Acquittal\n\nDelivering judgment on the case, Justice Ityonyiman held that the prosecution failed to prove the four counts against Mr Ogbuja.\n\nHe explained that the police investigators failed to subject the defendant to medical examination, in order to match his specimen with the findings in the medical reports that were presented before the court.\n\nIn evaluating the evidence, the judge held that two autopsy reports from the Federal Medical Centre in Makurdi and the Nigerian Police Forensic Laboratory in Lagos left him quandary.\n\n\u201cI cannot pick and choose which of the autopsy reports to rely on in reaching a just conclusion of this case,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2023: Osinbajo Visits Oba Of Benin, Re-Echoes Desire To Serve\n\nJustice Ityonyiman added that while the autopsy report from the Medical Centre in Makurdi said Miss Ochanya died of \u201cnatural cause\u201d, the one from the police forensic laboratory revealed that the deceased \u201csuffered diseases that were related to sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nDespite narrating her ordeals at the hands of the Ogbujas in a video tendered before the court, he said, \u201cit is regrettable that the deceased could not tell her story before she died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hereby acquit and discharge the defendant of all the four count-charge.\u201d\n\nWife Convicted\n\nElsewhere, Justice Mobolaji Olajunwo of the Federal High Court in Makurdi convicted Ogbuja\u2019s wife, Mrs Felicia, for negligence in the rape of the deceased.\n\nFelicia, on her part, was arraigned by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) over negligence that led to the rape and death of Ochanya.\n\nThe anti-trafficking agency accused Mrs Ogbuja of failing in her duty to protect the deceased from being raped by her husband and son.\n\nIn Mrs Ogbuja\u2019s case which coincided with that of her husband, Justice Olajunwo held that the defendant failed in her duty to protect Ochanya from \u2018being sexually abused by her son, Victor\u2019.\n\nAccording to her, the victim was being abused by Felicia\u2019s son but the defendant who owed the girl the duty of care to ensure that she was protected from such an act failed in doing so, even when her daughter, Winifred, drew her attention to the sexual assault.\n\nThe judge said the defendant made it impossible for the NAPTIP investigating officer to see and interrogate Winifred in the course of the investigation of the matter.\n\nAgreeing with the prosecution, she said \u201cthe evidence that Ochanya told the defendant (Mrs Ogbuja) about what was going on, and was not successfully challenged,\u201d proved NAPTIP\u2019s case.\n\nJustice Olajunwo also held that Felicia failed to challenge the prosecution\u2019s evidence that she \u201cthreatened to send Ochanya out of her house if she told anyone about the sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cThis evidence has neither been challenged nor controverted. The defendant failed to perform her duty as it concerned the well-being of Ochanya, particularly as it comes to her protection from being sexually abused.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fourth prosecution witness, in his testimony, said Ochanya upon been presented for medical examination complained of passing urine uncontrollably and had serious pain in the lower abdomen.\n\n\u201cWhen Ochanya was examined, it was discovered that the membrane covering the vagina opening was not there, which is an indication that Ochanya had been disvirgined,\u201d the judge stated while recalling the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\n\nBefore sentencing the convict, Felicia\u2019s lawyer, Abel Onoja, pleaded for leniency and called two witnesses in frantic efforts to save his client.\n\nBut Justice Olajunwo sentenced Mrs Ogbuja to five months imprisonment without an option of a fine, after listening to her lawyer\u2019s plea for clemency.\n\n\u201cTaking into consideration the testimonies of witnesses that testified to the defendant\u2019s character, the number of months contained in the law shall be reduced by the court.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the defendant is sentenced to five months imprisonment with no option of fine,\u201d she held.\n\nSearch For Education\n\nMiss Ochanya, in search of a sound education, had left her rural home at Ogene-Amejo for Ugbokolo township where she lived with the Ogbujas. Mrs Ogbuja is said to be Ochanya\u2019s maternal relation.\n\nThe Ogbujas residence, where they lived with the deceased, was said to be located on a street almost opposite the Emmanuel Primary and Secondary School where Ochanya obtained her primary education in Ugbokolo, Benue State.\n\nOchanya, who was a JSS1 pupil of the Federal Government Girls College Gboko in Benue State, died of complications linked to the alleged serial rape by Mr Ogbuja and his fugitive son.\n\nMr Ogbuja was later arraigned on four counts of sexual abuse of the late Ochanya during a period of over five years, which resulted in her death in October 2018.\n\nThe father and son allegedly abused the late Ochanya while she was living with them. But the son, Victor, disappeared after police started looking for him and his father over the case.\n\nDoctors later diagnosed Ochanya with Vesico-Vaginal Fistula (VVF) \u2013 a disease attributed to the serial rape allegedly by the two men.",

Assuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective, it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than 2 terms of 8 years. In other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yaradua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent 5 years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of 4 years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of 8 years.\u201d\n\nHis comments followed speculations that the former president may defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJonathan was elected President of Nigeria in the 2011 election but lost to Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Senate Amends Terrorism Act, Prohibits Payment of Ransom to Kidnappers",
          "text": "As part of efforts to avert the imminent placement of Nigeria in the International Cooperation and Review Group Process of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its looming sanctions on the economy, the Senate on Wednesday passed a bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, as well as prohibit payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nThat was as former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of passengers abducted by terrorists during the Kaduna train attack. Umar made the appeal in a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna.\n\nThe passage of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nChairman of the committee, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central), explained, \u201cThe need to comprehensively review the Terrorism Prevention Act arose from the unfavourable ratings of FATF recommendations of Nigeria\u2019s Mutual Evaluation Report and consequent placement of Nigeria in FATF\u2019s International Cooperation and Review Group Process with its impending sanctions on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the National Task Force on improving Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in Nigeria had proposed improvement on the Act in order to address the deficiencies noted in its provisions and align it with the required standard obtainable in other jurisdictions.\n\nTwo months ago, the federal government disclosed that it had uncovered 123 companies and 96 other entities linked to terrorism financing. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the companies included 33 Bureaux De Change (BDC). Mohammed also stated that the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit uncovered the suspected companies and individuals.\n\nThe companies, which were alleged to be conduit for movement of money by terrorists, are yet to be tried by the federal government.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been increasing attacks by different terrorist groups across the country, with several lives lost, scores injured, and many kidnapped or missing and unaccounted for.\n\nCurbing terrorism financing has remained a hard nut to crack for the Nigerian government either due to lack of political will or gaps in legislation. This has exacerbated insecurity and fear, what with the attempted attack on the Kaduna airport, attack on a Kaduna-bound train, and attack on security personnel and formations, all recently, as well as other nefarious activities by terrorist groups.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Derivatives Company Limited revealed that in the past decade, an estimated 87,903 persons had died through assaults by Boko Haram, sectarian actors, and other armed bandits in the country, with a lot of Nigerians now living in fear.\n\nBamidele, in his presentation, said the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, sought to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers, and terrorists for release of any person who had been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cThe overall import of this bill is to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom in Nigeria, which is fast spreading across the country.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the memoranda presented to the committee, a plethora of issues relating to terrorism and terrorism financing, in line with global best practices, were raised. He assured that the amendment to the terrorism law would set standards and the regulatory system intended to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks.\n\nBamidele added, \u201cHaving policies in place to combat financing of terrorism will surely reduce or eliminate privacy and anonymity in financial and other sundry transactions as it relates to the subject in our society.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the proposed repeal and enactment bill was geared towards improving the effectiveness of countermeasures against terrorism, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.\n\nThe senator noted that the repeal was aimed at providing adequate framework for improved international collaboration, inter-agency cooperation, and freezing of terrorist funds/assets.\n\nBamidele stated, \u201cThe passage of this bill will save Nigeria from being included among countries in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List with its attendant negative consequences, which might ultimately result to international sanctions that would affect the image of the country in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said it would complement the federal government\u2019s efforts in the fight against insecurity, when signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLawan said, \u201cIt is our belief here in the Senate that this bill, by the time signed into an Act by Mr. President, will enhance the efforts of this government in the fight against terrorism, kidnapping, and other associated and related vices.\n\n\u201cThis is one piece of legislation that can turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have done so much as a government, in terms of infrastructural development across all parts of this country, but because the security situation is not the kind of situation that we all want, this tends to overshadow all the tremendous and massive developments in our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the executive will waste no time in signing this bill into law, and it is our hope that this additional piece of legislation will achieve the purpose for which it has been worked upon by the Senate, and, indeed, the National Assembly, and for which it would also be signed by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear here, that the fight against insecurity, whether it is kidnapping, terrorism or whatsoever, is not the sole role of a government.\n\n\u201cThe contribution and support by citizens is essential, because our security agencies need vital and critical information against terrorism and other things that make life difficult for us.\u201d\n\nThe upper chamber passed the bill after it scaled Third Reading on the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate, thereafter, adjourned plenary till May 10, for the Sallah break.\n\nUmar Urges FG to Ensure Immediate Release of Kidnapped Victims of Kaduna Train Attack\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, yesterday, Umar said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, remained disturbing.\n\nUmar also appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.\u201d\n\nOn March 28, terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train and killed eight people, while several others were injured. Many people were abducted and are being held in captivity by the terrorists.\n\nOne of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack on the Kaduna bound train had been delivered of her baby,.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62.\n\nThe gunmen had ambushed the train heading for Kaduna from the nation\u2019s capital after bombing its rail track.\n\nARISE News had quoted the terrorists as insisting that they were not after a ransom, but exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were allegedly in government custody.\n\nA family source confirmed that one of the two pregnant women among the kidnapped victims had given birth in the terrorists\u2019 den with the help of doctors invited by the gang.\n\nSources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development that is still shocking to both the government and security operatives.\n\nMichael Olugbode, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "With the presidential primaries of political parties about a month from now and the election proper less than a year away, some of the nation\u2019s prominent political and business leaders, have literally moved to Saudi Arabia for lesser Hajj, not just prayers but to ponder the options open to them and the nation ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe latest personality and political heavyweight to join other Nigerian leaders in prayer at a high octane networking, is the former governor of Lagos State and frontline presidential hopeful, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was though in Mecca for the Umrah as with others, however, found the atmosphere conducive for political networking, as usual.\n\nApart from Tinubu, who just arrived Saudi Arabia for the conventional last 10 days of Ramadan as an optional Islamic practice, others who also left for lesser hajj were former Vice-President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; Africa\u2019s richest man and Chairman of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; Founder and Chairman of BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu and former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Malam Nuhu Ribadu.\n\nSome of the other known political names seen in Saudi Arabia, included former Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to Ghana, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, who is itching to be redistricted to Lagos West, from Central, where he initially represented, for another senatorial bid and a former two-time Senator for Lagos West, Ganiyu Olanrewaju Solomon.\n\nTraditionally, while some devout Muslims travel for Umrah to seal the last 10 days of Ramadan in supplication to Allah, Nigerian politicians, have also found in the practice, an opportunity to broker and seal political deals, design strategies for elections, and mull options open to them, either collectively or individually.\n\nParticularly, this has become a political culture in Lagos State, where Tinubu was governor for eight years and has continued to dominate its politics in the last 23 years.\n\nDuring political seasons, an average Lagos politician with ambition struggles, almost compulsorily, to be at the lesser hajj, since it is most likely the place, where crucial political decisions, relating to the career and future of others, would be taken, and often, whatever deal sealed in Saudi remains unchangeable.\n\nThus, Tinubu, who described his presidential aspiration as a life-long ambition, had set the standard for the campaign pattern ahead of 2023, when he started traveling round the country for consultations and to seek the blessings of prominent Nigerians for his aspiration.\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that for an avowed kingmaker, who decided to throw his hat into the ring, joining other like-minds for Umrah, both for prayers and political networking, was almost a question of when.\n\nSeen exchanging banter with others in Saudi after a video of him and Ribadu went viral, many believed that this meeting in the holy land before the elections, would afford Tinubu an opportunity to review his ambition and consider some of the options still open to him.\n\n\u201cObviously we all met in Mecca here for Umrah by accident and. Not that this was planned. But, as usual, such a gathering always affords us the opportunity to critically look at the state of the nation, particularly, now being an election season. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 all networking and programming for the 2023 elections,\u201d said one of the political leaders, who is also in Saudi for Umrah.",
