          "text": "The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has lamented the rate of destruction of infrastructure in Borno State and other parts of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the destructions are worse than he had imagined.\n\nHe said this at a town hall meeting in Maiduguri on Thursday, according to a copy of his speech obtained by our correspondent.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cI must confess that, based on the two town hall meetings (held earlier), the situation regarding the wanton destruction of public infrastructure is worse than we had imagined.\n\n\u201cFor example, we were told that it would cost the Federal Government 3.8 billion Naira to repair just four bridges that were damaged by vandals and petrol-laden tankers. That\u2019s a huge amount that could have been used to build new infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that massive infrastructure deficit is among the challenges we face in Nigeria. This is why the Muhammadu Buhari Administration has deliberately adopted an inclusive infrastructure provisioning framework that spreads to all sections of the country.\n\n\u201cWe could not have chosen a better venue than Maiduguri, which has been cut off from public power supply since\n\nJanuary 2021 due to the destruction of power infrastructure by terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists who are destroying power and telecommunication facilities in Borno have chosen to weaponize these attacks in order to inflict the maximum hardship on the people and also slow down the advances of our gallant troops in decimating them. They will fail in both instances.\u201d\n\nHe explained that despite a drastic drop in revenues and competing priorities, especially that of battling insecurity, the federal government has invested heavily in providing new infrastructure, as well as reconstructing and rehabilitating existing ones.\n\n\u201cIn recent times however, such laudable efforts of the government are being thwarted by some unpatriotic citizens through wanton destruction of critical infrastructure, thereby depriving the greater citizenry \u2013 for whose benefits these projects and services are provided \u2013 from enjoying them. Railway tracks are being subjected to wanton vandalism, bridge railings are being removed, manhole covers are being pilfered, and so are critical aviation, power and telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of such unpatriotic action and behaviour, aside endangering the lives of fellow innocent citizens, include the toll it takes on the government\u2019s limited revenue to replace, rehabilitate or totally reconstruct such destroyed infrastructure,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami\n\nThe Federal Government has succeeded in blocking terrorism financing in Nigeria, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said.\n\nMalami told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York that the federal government had also succeeded in identifying and detaining \u201chigh profile individuals\u201d responsible for funding terrorists\u2019 activities in the country.\n\nThe AGF had announced in May that the Nigerian government was about to begin the prosecution of about 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers and was profiling some high-profile Nigerians strongly suspected to be financing terrorism for prosecution.\n\nThe delay in their prosecution and unveiling of the suspects have been criticised in certain quarters, but Malami assured the federal government was determined to take stringent measures to counter insurgency in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have succeeded in identifying those that are responsible for funding terrorists,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cWe have also blocked the leakages associated with funding and then embarking on aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in term of the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cBut then, the truth of the matter is that investigation is ongoing, is advancing and for the purpose of investigation, I wouldn\u2019t like to be pre-emptive in terms of making disclosures that would have the effect of undermining the successes we are recording as far as investigation is concerned.\n\n\u201cBut one thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever we do in terms of detention and in terms of arrest is indeed backed by judicial process.\n\n\u201cWe have indeed obtained a legitimate court order taking into consideration what we have presented before the court; the court eventually exercised its discretion in terms of granting orders that we can have them in custody.\n\n\u201cThis is pending the conclusion of investigation, which investigation, in essence, is indeed deeply taking place and we are making a lot of successes and recording a lot of progress in the direction of investigation.\u201d\n\nThe chief law officer of Nigeria, however, said the issue of terrorism financing was a work in progress and would not like to be pre-emptive in terms of investigation.\n\nALSO READ: Court remands 2 men for unlawful possession of gun in Lagos\n\n\u201cBut one thing I can say for sure is, arising from such arrests, the terrorist funding and financing has indeed been crippled substantially and that eventually translated to some major improvements being recorded as far as crippling the strength of terrorists is concerned within the nation.\n\n\u201cYou can see visibly that we are indeed witnessing tremendous successes associated with the Boko Haram, which translate to significant decimation of the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cThey (Boko Haram) have been decimated to a larger extent and you can see what is unfolding as far as the North West banditry activities are concerned.\n\n\u201cThey (bandits) are as well been decimated to a larger degree. All these are indeed the effect of what we have done,\u201d he said.\n\nMalami also said that Nigeria was creating a consensus-building towards making assets recovery easier for countries.\n\nThe minister recalled that Nigeria had recovered 322 million dollars from Switzerland in 2017 and 311 million dollars from the U.S. in 2020.\n\nHe said Nigeria was looking at the possibility of recovering a further 200 million pounds from the U.S. aside from other associated assets being pursued in some other countries.\n\n\u201cWe are pursuing a lot of assets across the globe and we intend very soon, we are coordinating a further meeting relating to huge recovery in U.K. associated with certain personalities.\n\n\u201cBut I would not like to give further disclosure in respect of that to put into consideration the need not to be pre-emptive as far as our strategies are concerned.\n\nHe said the 311 million dollars recovered from Switzerland was deployed to execute the Abuja-Kano highway, the Lagos-Ibadan highway and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\n\u201cSo I think we are doing wonderfully well in terms of deploying the recovery of the looted assets and deploying same in projects that impact positively on the lives of people,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "An event of historical significance took place in Maitama, Abuja, on 16th September 2021, as the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, joined His Excellency, Babacar Matar Ndiaye, the Ambassador of the Republic of Senegal to Nigeria, to hoist the flag of Senegal at the Secretariat of West Africa Telecommunications Regulators Assembly (WATRA).\n\nDanbatta, who is also the Chairman of the Executive Council of WATRA, stated that the event was of such profound significance that it transcends the physical hoisting of the flag, noting that \u201cit symbolises the cohesion taking place in WATRA\u201d and giving concrete and louder expression to collaboration and cooperation among members states of the regional telecom regulatory body.\n\nProf. Danbatta also said that the increasing demonstration of cooperation and cohesion by WATRA member states signifies unflinching commitment to harnessing ICT resources to improve the quality of life of the people of the sub-region, noting that ICT remains an enabler for bridging the gaps in the pathway to development.\n\nStrengthening Danbatta\u2019s position, Ambassador Ndiaye, who is also Senegal\u2019s Permanent Representative to ECOWAS, described the ceremony as a happy occasion, noting that it was gratifying to gather at WATRA Secretariat to hoist the flag of Senegal alongside those of other member states.\n\nHe said Senegal has never relented in making remarkable contributions to ECOWAS and other regional bodies and indicated his country\u2019s readiness to work within the political and economic framework of ECOWAS to streamline challenges facing regulators like WATRA.\n\nAmbassador Ndiaye further stated that among the key challenges regulators face are the emergent Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, the convergence of networks and applications, the imperative of infrastructure sharing and the increasing needs of telecom consumers, dynamics of financial services, and electronic commerce in general. Ndiaye asserted that the telecom regulator is central to the acceleration of growth in other sectors of the economy and therefore occupies a significant place in the socioeconomic space.\n\nHe looked forward to continued collaboration to address the myriads of challenges in the telecom sector, and noted that the outbreak of COVID-19 and the envisioned post-COVID-19 relations have compounded the challenges of telecom regulation.\n\nThe Senegalese envoy seized the opportunity of the occasion to convey the gratitude of the Government and people of Senegal to the Federal Government of Nigeria for hosting WATRA, and thanked the NCC for the support it has continued to offer WATRA and for promoting greater cooperation among member states towards harnessing the benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nAliyu Yusuf Aboki, the Executive Secretary of WATRA, in his welcome address, expressed extreme delight at having the ambassador and the chairman of WATRA at the flag presentation and hoisting ceremony. Aboki noted that the presence of the duo underscored the importance that \u201cpolicymakers and political authorities in Africa attach to the digital economy as a means of promoting investment, jobs and growth\u201d, even as the meeting also signifies the sub-regional determination to work together in order to improve telecommunications regulations in a manner that enables \u201coperators and investors to deliver more affordable, higher quality and more innovative services\u201d to the people of West Africa.\n\nAboki who also recalled the rare strides made by the Government of Senegal in promoting digital economy amplified the voice of Ndiaye by expressing the gratitude of the 16 member countries of WATRA to the Nigerian Government, which, through the NCC, has continued to support \u201cthe Assembly and for hosting WATRA.\u201d\n\nThe West African Regulators Assembly (WATRA) is made up of ECOWAS member states and Mauritania. The hoisting of the flag of member states of WATRA at the Secretariat, an initiative of the Danbatta-led Executive Council, commenced after the last AGM where Aboki and Danbatta emerged, respectively, as Executive Secretary and Chairman of the Executive Council.\n\nThirteen member states had their respective flags hoisted at the AGM while Mauritania later sent a representative to perform the flag hoisting ceremony. With Senegal\u2019s symbolic presentation of its flag and its hoisting today, WATRA looks forward very excitedly to The Republic of Ghana to present and hoist its flag soon, in order to complete that process to further consummate the bonding among members of the Assembly.",

          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum on Wednesday said it regretted backing then candidate Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election, instead of the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nIt claimed that Buhari had, since succeeding Jonathan, let down a majority of Nigerians who trusted in his leadership before the 2015 polls.\n\nNEF\u2019s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum wants the country\u2019s next president to be one who would act in the \u201copposite direction\u201d of the incumbent.\n\nBaba-Ahmed, whose group called for Buhari\u2019s resignation in December 2020, spoke on Arise TV\u2019s \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 breakfast programme monitored by The Nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cIs there any Nigerian who is not disappointed in President Buhari including diehard APC (All Progressives Congress) people? Is there anybody who would not tell you he wished President Buhari had done much better?\n\n\u201cWe raised huge expectations, we told people, \u2018Get rid of Jonathan, put Buhari there, he would fix corruption, he would fix insecurity, he would fix the economy\u2019, (but) look at where we are now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can anybody say they are happy with the record of President Buhari? Even the people very close to him would tell you that they wished he could have done much better and he hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo, what we need to do now is to get ready to elect another President who would go in the opposite direction, a President who has a vision and a clear idea of what governance involves rather than just being a President.\n\nRead Also: 2023 Presidency and the imperative of zoning\n\n\u201cSo, I am disappointed and that is why today, I am actively involved in trying to see that a new leader emerges in getting Nigerians a new lease of life.\u201d\n\nJonathan, a former governor of Bayelsa State, was Vice-President between 2007 and 2010 and became president following the demise of then-President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in 2010.\n\nHe contested the 2011 presidential election and won but failed in his bid to get re-elected four years later, losing to Buhari.\n\nFollowing the clamour for a power shift to the South, Jonathan, who is currently Buhari\u2019s Special Envoy to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), is being courted by some politicians with an eye on the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Secretary of the party\u2019s Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, confirmed Jonathan\u2019s constitutional eligibility recently when he said the ex-president would get an opportunity to contest the 2023 presidency on the party\u2019s platform if he decides to join the APC.\n\nBaba-Ahmed, however, urged Southern governors not to negatively politicise the 2023 presidency, advising instead that they should instead negotiate as the North had lived under Southern Presidents \u2014 Olusegun Obasanjo and Jonathan \u2014 since Nigeria\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have lived under Southern presidents because we recognise that Nigeria is made up of sections, ethnic groups and interests. We recognise that we are northerners, pluralism is in our DNA; we accept that, we live with it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make the issue of the presidency a matter over which Nigerians would fight and threaten the country and the democratic process; that is very dangerous for this country.\u201d\n\nThe NEF spokesman insisted that what Nigeria needs is a president who realises the need to rebuild the country, secure Nigerians and check the downward trajectory of the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThe nation needs a leader that would do the things that President Buhari hasn\u2019t done, create inclusiveness, address resentment and frustration in other parts of the country and the north and speak and act for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he wrote off both the ruling APC and the leading opposition party, the PDP, saying they had no answer to what Nigerians want in a candidate in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, \u201csmaller parties\u201d might have the answer and should be allowed to field candidates with the character and capacity to lead Nigeria from all its current travails.",

He is in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s delegation to the ongoing United Nation General Assembly.\n\nThe projected VAT revenue of N2.26 trillion represents 16.2 per cent of the total approved expenditure of N13.98 trillion for 2022.\n\nA Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had ruled that states, and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), should collect VAT and Personal Income Tax.\n\nRead Also: VAT dispute is about constitutional issues and not the capacity of states to collect it\n\nSequel to the ruling, Lagos State and Rivers State enacted enabling laws to activate their collection of VAT.\n\nThe uncertainty around VAT was one of the concerns at the debate on the MTEF yesterday, although the upper chamber finally retained VAT collection as part of the Federal Government\u2019s revenues.\n\nBut many analysts said a Supreme Court judgment in favour of states\u2019 collection of VAT could have a material impact on national budget implementation.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the collection of VAT by the Federal Government would continue until there is a definite ruling by the Supreme Court granting state governments the right to collect VAT.\n\n\u201cOne of our colleagues in his contribution mentioned that we should not include the VAT. I think there is nothing wrong with continuing with the VAT as part of our revenues because there is no final judgement yet.\n\n\u201cTherefore we should not confuse our system until there is such a very clear-cut definite judgement by the Supreme Court, we should go ahead with VAT as part of the revenue resources available to us,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe upper chamber also approved the sum of N13.98 trillion as the total aggregate expenditure of the Federal Government for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThe approval followed the consideration of the report of the Senate Joint Committee on Finance, National Planning and Economic Affairs; Foreign and Local Debts; Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Down Stream Petroleum Sector; and Gas, on the 2022-2024 MTEF/FSP by the Senate. Chairman of the Joint Committee, Senator Solomon Adeola, presented the report.\n\nAdeola said the N13.98 trillion aggregate expenditure for 2022 was made up of total recurrent (non-debt) expenditures of N6.21trillion; Personnel Costs (MDAs) of N3.47 trillion; Capital expenditure (exclusive of transfers) N3.26 trillion; Special Intervention (recurrent) amounting to N350 billion; and Special intervention (Capital) of N10billion.\n\nRecommendations of the joint committee which were approved by the Senate include: \u201cThat the daily crude oil production of 1.88mbpd, 2.23mbpd, and 2.22mbpd for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively, be approved, in view of average 1.93mbpd over the past 3 years and the fact that a very conservative oil output benchmark has been adopted for the medium term in order to ensure greater budget realism.\n\n\u201cThat the benchmark oil price of USD$57 per barrel should be approved because of the clear evidence of wide consultations with key stakeholders and the age long fiscal strategy of addressing the oil price shocks by the adoption of a higher than forecast oil price benchmark for fiscal projections over the medium term.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the Exchange Rate of N410.15/US$ proposed by the Executive for the 2022-2024 be approved;\n\n\u201cThat the projected GDP growth rate of 4.20% be approved; That the projected Inflation rate of 13.00% be also approved;\n\n\u201cThat the Fiscal deficit estimate ofN5.62 trillion (including GOEs) also be sustained due to the Federal Government\u2019s conservative approach to target setting and its determination to improve the collection efficiency of the major revenue-generating agencies while it continues to enforce the implementation of the Performance Management Framework for GOEs by ensuring that they operate in more fiscally responsible manner whilst reviewing their operational efficiencies, and costs-to-income ratios, as declared;\n\n\u201cThat the projected New Borrowings of N4.89 trillion (including Foreign and Domestic Borrowing) be approved, subject to the provision of details of the borrowing plan to the National Assembly;\n\n\u201dThat the USD$3.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan at the rate of 0.01% to 0.02% be approved to shore up its internal borrowing and to reduce external borrowing because of the exchange rate risks.\n\n\u201cThat the following sundry parameters in the 2022-2024 MTEF/FSP Document be also approved: FGN retained revenue of N8.36 trillion; total FGN proposed expenditure of N13.98 trillion; Fiscal deficit of N5.62 trillion (including GOEs);\n\n\u201cNew Borrowings of N4.89 trillion (including Foreign and domestic Borrowing), subject to the provision of details of the borrowing plan to the National Assembly;\n\n\u201cStatutory transfers, totaling, N613.4 billion; Debt Service estimate of N3.12 trillion; Sinking Fund to the tune of N292 billion; Pension, Gratuities & Retirees Benefits of N567 billion; and\n\n\u201cAggregate FGN Expenditure of N13.98 trillion; made up of total recurrent (Non-debt) of N6.21 trillion; Personnel Costs (MDAs) of N3.47 trillion; Capital expenditure (exclusive of Transfers) of N3.26 trillion; Special Intervention (recurrent)totalling to N350 billion; and Special intervention (Capital) of N10 billion.\n\n\u201cThat the Salaries and Wages Commission should review the salary structure of all the MDAs, in other to come up with a new salary structure for the MDAs that will reflect the true financial position of the Agencies.\n\n\u201cThat there should be a continuous review of the Fiscal Responsibility Act to ensure that all revenues are remitted to the CRF as at when due, to curtail frivolous deductions and diversion of funds by the MDAs.\u201d",

          "text": "By Osagie Otabor, Akure; Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba; Nwanosike Onu, Awka and Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOndo and Delta state governments on Wednesday chided Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai for accusing Southern governors of politicising farmer-herder clashes with the enactment of anti-open grazing laws.\n\nThey accused El-Rufai of \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d and \u201cencouraging anarchy\u201d with his opposition to the collective decision of his 17 colleagues in the South.\n\nEl-Rufai had on Tuesday wondered why the southern governors were rushing to enact laws prohibiting open grazing in their respective states after their colleagues in the North had resolved that ranching was the way out of the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is unhelpful is politicising the situation and passing legislation that you know that you cannot implement. The Northern State Governors\u2019 Forum has already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production. And we must move towards ranching.\u201d\n\nBut Ondo and Delta state governments said there was \u201cno wisdom\u201d in the comment of the governor, who is known for \u201dtalking out of turn.\u201d\n\nAlso, Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola defended the state\u2019s anti-open grazing law, saying it was meant to safeguard the lives of residents.\n\nOndo State Commissioner for Information and Orientation Donald Ojogo said going by the comment, El-Rufai, was plotting to externalise banditry.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor El-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffice in the North.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, any such comment like that of the Kaduna Governor merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise \u201cof resentment of a law\u201d by affected stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the South, the most despicable situation in the North that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome. It\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the anti-open grazing law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay. It shall be zealously guarded and conscionably deployed to protect all residents, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the law.\u201d\n\nOlisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary to Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, said it was uncharitable for El Rufai to criticise his colleagues for enacting laws for the public good.\n\nIfeajika said: \u201cIt is most uncharitable for El Rufai to make such comments about what his colleagues are doing. Unfortunately, El Rufai is known for talking out of turn. It is hogwash. He is playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cAnyone that infringes on the law when it becomes operational, will face the music. I wonder whether El-Rufai can come all the way from Kaduna State to stop its enforcement. It is wrong for him to dare his colleagues. As far as Delta is concerned, that is El Rufai talking in Kaduna. It is of no consequence in Delta State.\u201d\n\nIn Osogbo, the Osun State capital, Oyetola told stakeholders, including herders, that the anti-open grazing law was not meant to witch hunt them.\n\nOyetola who was represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, said: \u201cThe law banning open grazing is not to witch hunt the Fulani, Bororo, and herders, but to protect all the residents of the state. The law will help the already existing harmonious relationship that we are enjoying in the state.\n\n\u201cIt will make it very easy to identify intruding herders coming into the state who may be fomenting troubles and tagging the leadership of the herders and the Fulani.\u201d\n\nAt the Anambra State House of Assembly, the Anti-Open Grazing Bill passed its first reading yesterday. The second reading is expected to come up on Tuesday\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo also criticised El-Rufai, saying his comment was intended to demean the position of the Southern governors.\n\nThe organisation said the only reason El-Rufai could make such remarks was that almost all the commissioners of police in Southern Nigeria were of Northern extraction.\n\n\u201cWe call it (El-Rufai\u2019s remark) arrogance because the position of the 17 governors should be taken very seriously. We didn\u2019t expect that a governor would rise and make a remark that tends to demean the position of his colleagues,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia, said.\n\nOgbonnia added: \u201cEl-Rufai\u2019s outburst is one of the reasons we are calling for a decentralised security architecture and also the need for such regional security outfits like Ebube Agu and Amotekun.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai knows that most of these commissioners of police are from the north and sometimes they may not be willing to cooperate in the implementation of the law against open grazing. That\u2019s why I said his comment smacks of arrogance.\u201d",

The PDP will hold its convention on October 31.\n\n\u201cThe position of the committee is that zoning is a Herculean task and it will prefer a broad-based consultation before submitting its report,\u201d a senior member of the party said last night.\n\nA source said the Tuesday night meeting of party leaders agreed \u201cnot to tamper with the 2017 zoning formula.\u201d\n\nThe 2017 zoning formula led to the emergence of the party\u2019s 2019 presidential candidate from the North while the party chairman came from the South.\n\n\u201cWe are going to table our demands with cogent reasons before the PDP Zoning Committee headed by Governor Ugwuanyi. Some of our leaders in this group will meet with the committee. It is left to the panel to accept or reject our presentation.\n\nWe believe if the 2017 formula is adopted, we can launch ourselves back to power in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cOur recommendations are not final, the National Executive Committee of PDP will still consider the report of the Ugwuanyi\u2019s committee.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that a former Minister of Police Affairs, Ambassador Adamu Maina Waziri was the convener of the meeting.\n\nThose at the meeting were two former Presidents of the Senate, a former Minister of Women Affairs, Hajia Inna Ciroma; ex-governors Attahiru Bafarawa; Babangida Aliyu, Sule Lamido and Boni Haruna; a former National Chairman Alh. Kawu Baraje; a former Minister of Special Duties Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN); and Hon. Theophillus Dakkas Shan.\n\nOthers included Sen. Zainab Kure; Sen.Joel Danlami Ikenya; Dr. Akilu Indabawa; Hon. Galadima Abba; Hon. Mukhtar Ahmed; Hajiya Hauwa Musa Kida; Hon. Manu Swa; Mrs. Launrentia Mallam; and Dr. Aminu Abdullahi among others.\n\nThe leaders were said to be of the opinion that the influence of the All Progressives Congress (APC) must be curtailed in the North.\n\nOther party offices are proposed to be zoned as follows: Deputy National Chairman; National Secretary; National Financial Secretary; National Auditor; National Women Leader; and Deputy National Secretary.\n\nFor the South, the leaders demanded the following: National Chairman; Deputy National Chairman; National Organising Secretary; National Treasurer; National Legal Adviser; National Publicity Secretary and National Youth Leader.\u201d\n\nA source at the meeting said: \u201cHaving studied the nation\u2019s political situation and the need to salvage decided to meet to guide the PDP on its permutations for 2023 beginning with the forthcoming party\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe zoning formula for power sharing at the party level will no doubt go a long way to determine where the presidential ticket will go to.\n\n\u201cWe agreed not to tamper with the 2017 zoning formula in the party in order to give APC a good fight during the next poll.\n\n\u201cFor PDP, we have come to terms with the fact that we cannot afford to be out of power for 12 years. And PDP is the only party with solutions to the present challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nA former governor at the session said: \u201cBy implications, we want the party to retain its presidential ticket in the North where we can curtail APC with its so-called 12million votes.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, has taken a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, for castigating southern governors over their anti-open grazing stance.\n\nGovernor El-rufai, during a visit at the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had warned his southern counterparts that it was unhelpful politicising anti-open grazing law and passing legislation that they know cannot be implemented.\n\n\u201cThe northern state governors forum has already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production. And we must move towards ranching. But moving towards ranching cannot be done overnight. We have to have a plan, we have to have resources and we have to implement it sensibly. It is not a matter of populist legislation or saying tomorrow this or that. It is not a solution.\n\nBut Akeredolu said the comment by El-Rufai was devious and showed his support for banditry. He said southern governors were against open grazing and no amount of threat would make them change their position.\n\nThe Ondo governor stated this in a statement by his Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, Governor Nasir el-Rufai, if he was properly quoted and his views not misrepresented, is struggling hard to export banditry to the south under an expressed opinion that is laced with mischief. In these days and times, anyone who makes statements such as that allegedly made by the governor belongs to a class of an unenviable ilk masquerading as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no wisdom in condemning or banning open grazing, prohibiting inter border movement of cattle in the north, including Kaduna, with an accompanying disapproval of a law that gives bite to same, in another part of the country. Perhaps, it is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor el-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffices in the north. For emphasis, any such comment like that of the Kaduna Governor, if indeed he made that statement, merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise \u201cof resentment of a law by affected stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the south, the most despicable situation in the north that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome.

It shall be zealously guarded and conscionable deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the Law.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osun State government has began the sensitisation of herdsmen on the recently-passed anti-open grazing law.\n\nThe sensitisation, which had heads of herders groups in the state in attendance, was organised by the state\u2019s civic centre.\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola had signed the Bill into law on September 15.\n\nSpeaking at the sensitisation, Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, said the programme was put in place to sensitise herdsmen on the content of the law.\n\nHe said the programme was to let the herdsmen understand that the law was not meant to witch-hunt or segregate them in the state.\n\n\u201cThe programme is also to educate them to operate within the ambit of the law and not to claim ignorance of it,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Another the leaders of Yoruba nation, Foluso Aruleba, recalled that in 2015 United Nations General Assembly, Buhari called for a self-determination in favour of Western Sahara people and the Palestinians, saying it was now the turn of the Yoruba to be set free and allowed to have their own country.\n\nAruleba said: \u201cWe too need our self-determination now, we need our referendum now. There is nothing new under the sun, it happened in Germany in 1933 from where they withdrew from the League of Nations, USSR in 1991, Southern Sudan in 2011. I and my family want to return to home but we cannot under this circumstance. The people that protested in favour of this government were spending hundreds of dollars here, those of us living in this country cannot spend money like that because we work hard for our money. What we currently have is an unequal yoke, we have to go our separate ways.\u201d\n\nHowever, a section of the large Diaspora poulation, whose remittances of monies running into billions of American dollars have lifted Nigeria\u2019s economy has continued to show its political clout by mobilising support for the motherland with independent campaigns and rallies on New York streets.\n\nSeveral demonstrators chanting slogans in favour of the continued existence of the Nigeria as an indivisible entity have been greeting passers-by with banners proclaiming: \u201cOne Nigeria, One Destiny,\u201d \u201cWe Want Unity not Secession,\u201d among others.\n\nThe goal of the group named \u201cUnited Nigeria Group\u201d is to sensitise the global gathering of the developments in the country and to show their support to President Muhammadu Buhari in his \u201cefforts to resolve the challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), and the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), under the leadership Prof Banji Akintoye, have dissociated themselves from a three-day Yoruba nation rally slated for Washington DC in the United States of America from October 1-3, 2021. This followed a video clip that has gone viral on the social media, creating awareness for the rally. The promotion video clip purportedly emanated from a group called \u2018Yoruba Nation in conjunction with its associates, including the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nCoordinating Secretary of NINAS, Tony Nnadi, and Vice-Chairman, Ilana Omo Oodua, Otunba Shade Olukoya, in a statement made available to Daily Sun on Wednesday, stated that the emblems of NINAS and that of IOO were \u201cdisplayed very conspicuously in a manner that creates the false Impression that NINAS and its associated platform, Ilana Omo Oodua, are somehow involved in the planned Washington DC rally of October 1-3, 2021.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) has raised the alarm that Nigeria is turning to a land flowing with tears and blood because of the impact of terror, banditry and herders attacks and kidnapping.\n\nThe Primate, the Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba, who spoke on the theme of the conference: \u201cAbiding in Christ: God\u2019s Panacea in an Unstable World\u201d said a situation in which communities that are predominantly Christians were targeted one after another in some parts of Kaduna State and the North Central region was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to brand the bandits and herders attackers as terrorists and let them be treated as such.\u201d\n\nThe cleric urged Nigerians to avail themselves the opportunity the 2023 general elections offer to exercise their right to choose new leaders.\n\nHe appealed to the Federal Government to urgently address the free fall in the value of the country\u2019s currency because of the attendant impact on the store of value and confidence of investors.\n\nThis came as the church bestowed award for exemplary leadership qualities in a challenging economy and dedication in the service of God and humanity on the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and Governor Adedapo Abiodun of Ogun State.\n\nAlso, honoured is the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Professor Emmanuel Abayomi, with an award for quality and equitable healthcare delivery.\n\nThe awardees were honoured at the standing committee meeting of the Church of Nigeria, held at the Diocese of Lagos, Archbishop Adebola and Oluranti Ademowo Resource Centre, Faith Plaza, Bariga, Lagos State.\n\nPrimate Ndukuba said the political leaders were considered for the award for their outstanding role, courageous leadership and standing firm in defence of Nigerians against insecurity, provision of basis infrastructure to the citizenry and the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAddressing the congregation on the state of the nation and the role of the church, Governor Wike admonished the leadership of the church to encourage its members to be part of the governance process.\n\nHe noted that a situation where Christians leave governance for politicians alone was no longer obtainable.\n\nAccording to him, the effect of bad leadership would also affect the church if they remain passive to the issue of governance.\n\n\u201cYou must be part of chosing leadership. Don\u2019t say you have no role, you have a role. When you don\u2019t participate, bad leaders will emerge and when bad leadership emerges, you are part of it. You must encourage your people to be part of leadership. I didn\u2019t go to any school to study leadership.\n\n\u201cSo, nobody should say that as a Christian, you cannot be a governor, no. The head of SUBEB in my state is a priest and you can see the leadership he has given to that agency today. You will feel proud about it. That used to be the most corrupt agency, but today it is headed by a priest and you can see the difference.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike decried the inherent injustice that has characterised the Nigerian-State, and urged the church to speak against socio-political issues adversely affecting the progress of the country.\n\n\u201cWe say we are all one Nigeria. We went to World Bank to borrow money to do specific projects. One of the states that make up Nigeria I hear is Rivers State. And I also know in paying this money back to World Bank, money that comes from the resources of my state will be used in paying back this money. But my state was denied to have projects from that loan.\u201d\n\nHe said a situation where states depend on the Federal Government to survive could no longer be tenable.\n\nHe insisted that states must be allowed to collect revenues such as Value Added Tax (VAT) to enable them improve the welfare of their people.\n\n\u201cYou have gone to take loan and I am one of those states that will pay back those loan and you deny me the benefit from the projects that that money will be used for. I have no problem with that. Allow me the one (VAT) the constitution says I am entitled to, let me collect that one and develop my state.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that some governors have refused to think out of the box on how to boost economic activities in their states.\n\nWike said: \u201cThere is flood in my state, it requires N200 millon, I will go to Abuja to beg. Even as a governor, I will knee down before a DG of an agency of government. You will knee down for a director just because of N300 million. That is the status of some of the governors of some states.\u201d\n\nGovernor of Lagos State, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, commended the church for its support and announced the waiver of N2 billion for land acquired by the Church of Nigeria in Lagos State.\n\nThe governor stated that Nigeria and the rest of the world were going through difficult times amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He canvassed for mass vaccination of the citizens.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "*Benchmarks oil at $57 per barrel, N410/$1 exchange rate\n\n*Okays crude production of 1.88mbpd, 2.23mbpd, 2.22mbpd for 2022, 2023, 2024\n\n*Lawan backs collection of VAT by FIRS until legal outcome is determined\n\nDeji Elumoye, Juliet Akoje in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nThe senate has approved the federal government\u2019s revenue projection of N8.36 trillion and proposed expenditure of N13.98 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year. The lawmakers also passed the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP) ahead of the expected presentation of the 2022 Appropriations bill to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe endorsements came as President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, backed the continuous collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) by the federal government until the final judgement of the Supreme Court on the matter.\n\nThe passage of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework was sequel to the consideration and deliberation of a report by the Joint Committee on Finance; Local and Foreign Debts; Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Downstream Petroleum Sector and Gas.\n\nChairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Solomon Adeola, presented the Joint Committee report.\n\nSenators took turns to debate the MTEF/FSP document, which was submitted to the legislative arm for approval last month by Buhari.\n\nContributing to the debate, former Governor of Benue State and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Power, Senator Gabriel Suswam, lamented that government borrowing had been increasing yearly, and wondered when it would stop.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s budget deficit has gone beyond \u201cthe threshold of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\u201d Suswam frowned on irrelevant waivers granted businesses even as the country operated a deficit budget.\n\nThe former governor also expressed displeasure that the country was dishing out N2.4 trillion as waivers when it was having over N5.6 trillion deficit.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe issue of borrowing and deficit. We now have a deficit that has been growing year in, year out. When is it going to stop? These are issues that agitate the minds of Nigerians, especially when it concerns borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe have a deficit that has gone beyond the threshold of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007, which then means that we (must) amend the FRA so as to accommodate this deficit.\n\n\u201cThe FRA stipulates a threshold of three per cent. Last year, it was above the threshold, this year, it is above by six per cent.\n\n\u201cIn managing an economy, we need to combine fiscal policies with monetary policies.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aviation, Senator Smart Adeyemi, stated, \u201cThere was nothing wrong with borrowing, provided it is channelled towards improving infrastructure, such as roads, health facilities, as well as empowering Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Red Chamber thereafter approved the daily crude oil production of 1.88 million barrels per day (mbpd), 2.23mbpd, and 2.22mbpd for 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, \u201cin view of average 1.93mbpd over the last three years and the fact that a very conservative oil output benchmark has been adopted for the medium term in order to ensure greater budget realism.\u201d\n\nThe senate, in its recommendations, also approved the benchmark oil price of $$57 per barrel; adopted the exchange rate of N410.15/$ proposed by the executive for 2022-2024; and gave its nod to the projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 4.20 per cent; as well as 13 per cent inflation rate.\n\nIn addition, the upper chamber approved fiscal deficit of N5.62 trillion, and new borrowings of N4.89 trillion \u2013 an amount that includes foreign and domestic borrowing \u2013 subject to the provision of details of the borrowing plan to the National Assembly.\n\nThe senate approved other parameters, such as statutory transfers totalling N613.4 billion; debt service estimate of N3.12 trillion; sinking fund to the tune of N292 billion; pension, gratuities and retirees benefits of N567 billion.\n\nOut of the aggregate federal government\u2019s expenditure of N13.98 trillion, the upper chamber approved the sum of N6.12 trillion for total recurrent (non-debt); N3.47 trillion as personnel cost for Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs); N3.26 trillion for capital expenditure (exclusive transfers); N350 billion for special intervention (recurrent); and N10 billion for special intervention (Capital).\n\nThe upper chamber in its report recommended that the fiscal deficit estimate of N5.62 trillion should be sustained due to the federal government\u2019s conservative approach to target setting and its determination to improve collection efficiency of major revenue generating agencies.\n\nIt further called on the Salaries and Wages Commission to review the salary structure of all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in order to come up with a new salary structure that will reflect the true financial position of the agencies.\n\nThe chamber demanded a continuous review of the Fiscal Responsibility Act to ensure that all revenues are remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) as and when due, in order to curtail frivolous deductions and diversion of funds by the MDAs.\n\nIt maintained that all laws relating to the mining business should be reviewed urgently to ensure an upward review of rates applied to royalties, ground rent, and license renewal for all mining companies operating in Nigeria. The senate said this would guarantee transparency in the collection of revenue by relevant agencies. It recommended stringent sanctions in proposed new laws to address illegal mining.\n\nThe senate also called on the Nigeria Customs Service to accelerate the process of installing scanners at all ports across the country to curb smuggling and underpayment of custom duties on imported goods, which has resulted in huge loss of revenue to the government.\n\nThe upper chamber urged the federal government to urgently implement the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) recently assented to by the president in order to curtail the problems of smuggling and round-tripping of petroleum products imported into the country.\n\nIn addition, the chamber recommended that the proposed budget of Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs) be reviewed upward to reflect their capabilities to generate revenue. It further recommended that the offices of the Accountant General (AGF), Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Fiscal Responsibility Commission be strengthened in the areas of staffing and funding of their activities to ensure optimal performance.\n\nThe chamber stated that the Acts establishing some MDAs, such as Nigeria Investment Promotion Council (NIPC), National Lottery Trust Fund Act, Bank of Industry Act, Bank of Agriculture Act, Energy Commission Act, and Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Commission, if reviewed and amended, would assist to generate more revenue to the coffers of government.\n\nIt also recommended that the federal government\u2019s budget be reviewed and purged of some agencies with demonstrated capacity to stand on their own without recourse to government budget. It identified such agencies to include the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria.\n\nSpeaking after the passage of MTEF/FSP, Lawan stressed that the lawmakers needed to up their game in the area of oversight.\n\nAccording to him, much needs to be done by the various committees, especially in the area of oversight, to ensure full implementation of the annual budget of the federal government.\n\nOn Value Added Tax (VAT), Lawan said there was nothing wrong in continuing with VAT since there was no finality in the judgement yet.\n\nThe senate president said, \u201cTherefore, we shouldn\u2019t confuse our system until there is a very clear cut, definite judgement by the Supreme Court. We should go ahead with VAT as part of the resources available to us\u201d.\n\nLawan urged the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and other major revenue generating agencies to strive to bring in more revenue into the coffers of government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have given them all the support that is necessary.

          "title": "NNPC: Global Gas Crisis May Push Oil Prices $10 Higher in Three Months",
          "text": "*FG to halt OPEC allocation under-performance by October, mid-November, says Kyari\n\n*Emotions, not science, driving conversations on energy transition, Barkindo insists\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday said the global natural gas crisis, which has resulted in rising prices, could push up oil prices by as much as $10 a barrel over the next three to six months.\n\nWholesale gas prices have surged by 250 per cent since the beginning of the year, including a 70 per cent rise, disrupting food supplies in parts of Europe and putting several energy suppliers out of business.\n\nIn Nigeria, the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), or cooking gas, has increased by more than 100 per cent in the last few months due to under-supply, according to NNPC. Although, marketers have also attributed the increase to the introduction of a 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) and rising dollar value to the naira.\n\nOver 60 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s domestic gas needs are sourced internationally, while the rest is sourced locally, even though the country sits atop a 206 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) proven quantity of the commodity.\n\nSpeaking in a conversation monitored on Bloomberg Television, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated that in the next three to six months, the current distortion in the market could lead to an increase in oil prices by at least $10. With Brent crude hitting $76 on Wednesday, the increase could actually be about $86 during the period.\n\nKyari noted that soaring gas prices would most likely seep into the oil prices because consumers would be forced to seek fuel alternatives to natural gas in the nearest future because of rising prices, as demand for oil could be boosted by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\n\u201cIt will absolutely hit crude prices as energy consumers are forced to shift from gas to other fuels,\u201d the NNPC GMD stated. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be very wrong if you said you would see an additional $10 on a barrel maybe three months, maximum six months,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the world is presently in a potential crisis because last year, a number of things were not done right, including under-investment in the gas sector, particularly.\n\nKyari said, \u201cThe implication of that is that we\u2019re going to see the effect coming up in a year or two maximum. And that will also affect the gas supply all over the globe and, particularly, in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to show up in a number of gas-rich countries and gas supply projects are being stalled, a number of midstream gas projects are being stalled or delayed, and the net effect will be that there will be an impact on pricing coming very shortly.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that there was still clearly a supply gap, stressing that in the country, supply to the Nigeria LNG plant has been beset by several challenges in recent times.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cThere are a number of things going on now to improve on the gas supply. We surely have issues around gas supply to the LNG plant, in particular, and even into the domestic market and the net effect is that you will see some slippages in cargos in 2022 and even in 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd the implication of that is that you have to do something pretty quickly and we have lost time, we have lost investment and for us, what must happen is a very quick return to a pre-Covid-19 level investment and that, of course, is being adjusted and I know that this is a key challenge for the industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyari, since in many jurisdictions, including Nigeria, gas production is tied to oil production and much of the production is associated, prices may spiral in several areas.\n\nHe stated that closing the global oil supply gap in three, four months\u2019 time might not be feasible, but noted that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance in the last few months in relation to the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be halted by the end of October this year or mid November.\n\n\u201cFrom everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ll get back to the OPEC level, probably, by the end of October and maximum middle of November. We\u2019re not far from that,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe GMD pointed out that the national oil company was going through a transformation that would see it invest more in renewable energy sources, going forward.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe are undergoing a transformation and what this means is that we\u2019re going to lead a company that will become the biggest company in Africa, not just the company that will lead the transition into renewables as we go forward to zero carbon situation.\n\n\u201cAnd what we have to do is to focus on gas development, as everybody else is doing, and also focus on the reality, which is that you need to go electric and to do this, you need a number of things done as quickly as possible to make this company completely commercial and completely profitable. It already is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the OPEC Secretary General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said current conversations around the transition to a carbon-free world were driven by sheer emotions, rather than facts and science.\n\nSpeaking on the side-lines of Gastech, an industry expo in Dubai, Barkindo stated that there were many distortions in discussing of a world without fossil fuels, with the planned focus on renewables.\n\nBarkindo said, \u201cI have also in my contribution, in my panel, talked about the distortion of facts, and the science, the misrepresentation of these facts in the conversation, which is not healthy because climate change and the energy transition are supposed to be guided by the science.\n\n\u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is supposed to be the most authoritative body with regard to both climate change and the transition. And we in OPEC, we believe they are doing a great job; they are producing very important seminal reports.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, these reports are being set aside, and the discussions ensuing at the moment, more or less, are being driven by emotions rather than by the great work that the scientific body is producing for all of us.\u201d\n\nOn the energy transition, Barkindo emphasised the vital role of oil in meeting the growing demand for energy, adding that predictable investment is required to address the increasing global needs, highlighting the need to address energy poverty and meet global commitments to expand energy access.\n\nReferencing OPEC\u2019s release of the World Oil Outlook 2021, the secretary general noted that oil and natural gas would continue to supply more than half the world\u2019s energy needs in 2045, with oil around 28 per cent, followed by gas at 24 per cent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says anti-open grazing law has come to stay\n\n*Claims southern govs have capacity to enforce act\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Fidelis David in Akure, Alex Enumah in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nThe Ondo State Governor and Chairman, Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, yesterday, took a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Nasir El-Rufai, for criticising the legal approach adopted by the southern governors in handling the open grazing crisis, saying his statement was a ploy to externalise banditry in the country.\n\nAlso, while speaking on the Arise News Television, Akeredolu, who told his Kaduna counterpart that the southern governors had the capacity to deal with anyone, who contravened the laws, accused el-Rufai of inciting the herders against them, even as he reiterated the resolve of the South that the presidency must come to the region in 2023.\n\nEl-Rufai had while speaking to newsmen on Tuesday after a visit to the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, insisted that the anti-open grazing law being passed by some Southern states was not implementable, but that ranching and not open grazing was the solution to the ongoing farmer/herder\u2019s clashes.\n\nBut, Akeredolu, first in an official statement by his Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said, \u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufai, if he was properly quoted and his views not misrepresented, is struggling hard to export banditry to the South under an expressed opinion that is laced with mischief.\u201d\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIn these days and times, anyone who makes statements such as that allegedly made by the governor belongs to a class of an unenviable ilk masquerading as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no wisdom in condemning/banning open grazing, prohibiting inter border movement of cattle in the North, including Kaduna, with an accompanying disapproval of a law that gives bite to same, in another part of the country.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor el-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially, as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffices in the North.\u201d\n\nThe Ondo governor noted that, \u201csuch comment like that of the Kaduna Governor, if indeed he made that statement, merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise of resentment of a law by affected stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn order words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the South, the most despicable situation in the North, that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome. It\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, further added that, \u201cThe Anti-Grazing Law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay. It shall be zealously guarded and conscionably deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the Law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise, Akeredolu, who wondered why anyone would think the region was playing politics with the issue, warned that the south did not take the wellbeing and the livelihood of its people lightly and would do anything to protect them.\n\nHe claimed to be surprised by the utterances of the Kaduna governor said, adding that, \u201cThere is no politics about the anti-open grazing law. We say people are destroying the livelihood of our own people and we say we are not going to allow it to continue and it is certain.\n\n\u201cAnd if he says it is not a law we cannot enforce, let him wait or let him bring his herders here, they will go back to inform him whether we are able to enforce the laws, he will get to know. There is no need for him to be in a hurry, the people will go back to him to tell him that it is being enforced and we are going to enforce it\u201d.\n\nMore on the issue of capacity, Akeredolu noted that the law was already in operation in Ondo, because those who were infringing on the law were paying for it.\n\nAccording to him, the state has established a process to ensure any herder, who destroyed any farm was made to pay repatriation before the cattle would be released to such a herder, adding that, \u201cas a second time offender, you are going to prison.\u201d\n\nWhile observing that Miyetti Allah and other herders in Ondo State were already cooperating with the government, he lamented that the Kaduna governor and those who speak like him were only inciting herders against the people of the south and therefore warned that anyone, who broke the law in the state would be punished in line with the law.\n\n\u201cI am happy that Miyetti Allah people are willing to imbibe it; they are not waiting to be incited as my brother want to think. Maybe they should flout the law, that is why he is saying it is not implementable or whatever his words are, that is like wanting to incite the people.\n\n\u201cYou are trying to incite the people, who say they are going to oppose this law and we are saying that if you oppose this law, you will face the consequences. The law is there and has been passed by our own House of Assembly and the Houses of Assembly of every state that has passed the law and every state that has passed the law will implement the law to the letter,\u201d he maintained.\n\nThe Ondo governor queried why southern governors should consult with their northern counterparts before passing a law that was in the interest of their own people, adding that the southern governors could not \u201cbeg\u201d northern governors before passing a law that was in the interest of the people.\n\nHe held that the northern governors met regularly and even met with the president after their meeting and the southern governors have never made any fuss about it.\n\nAkeredolu argued that even the northern governors knew that open grazing was not in the best interest of their people but only wanted to continue to oppress them by allowing them to take their cows from one region to another, adding that that their mode of life was anachronistic and not going to hold.\n\nHe commended Katsina State for its decision to embrace ranching, noting that they were ready to support the state and give it necessary patronage, when operational.\n\nAddressing the 2023 presidential election, the chairman of the Southern Governors Forum said, \u201cThe only way we can continue to remain united as a country is that there must be fairness, there must be equity and there must be justice and the only thing that is fair in this country today is that if we have had a northern president for eight years, it must come down to south this time. That is what we are saying, we are not forcing it on people. We are going to go out and campaign about it, this is politics, it is a game of number\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo became president in 1999 because everybody agreed that the president must come from the south and after Obasanjo, everybody also agreed that it should go to the north and Alhaji Umaru Yar\u2019Adua also emerged as president.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it, that is understanding\u201d, he said, adding that the north has no choice but to be fair to the south and support the push for a southern president.\n\nHis position on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which was just returned to the National Assembly for amendment, was that the governors would continue to push for the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which belonged to both the federal g and the state governments, rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which did not represent their interest but that of the federal government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We now have a deficit that has been growing year in, year out. When is it going to stop.\n\nThese are issues that agitate the minds of Nigerians especially when it concerns borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe have a deficit that has gone beyond the threshold of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007 which then means that is either we amend the FRA so as to accommodate this deficit.\n\n\u201cThe FRA stipulates a threshold of three per cent. Last year it was above the threshold, this year, it is above by six per cent.\n\n\u201cIn managing an economy, we need to combine fiscal policies with monetary policies.

          "text": "*Seeks expansion of upstream, midstream memberships\n\n*Appoints Komolafe CEO of URC, retains DPR\u2019s Auwalu\n\n*Removes petroleum, finance ministries from agencies\u2019 boards\n\n*Sends EFCC board nominees for approval\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nExactly 37 days after the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was enacted, President Muhammadu Buhari has written to the senate, requesting amendments to the law and expansion of membership of the board of the Upstream Regulatory Commission (URC).\n\nBuhari, in a letter read yesterday on the floor of the senate, also sought an increase in the membership of the board of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe president hinged his desire to alter the new law on the need to ensure national balance in appointments into the boards, in the letter dated September 16, 2021, and read yesterday during plenary by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari further moved to fast-track the full operation of the newly signed Act, sending a list of nominees for the proposed URC, the regulator of the upstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry as well NMDPRA, which would oversee the midstream and downstream sector.\n\nBuhari explained that the appointment of two non-executive members to the board of the midstream, downstream and upstream commissions, as provided for by the Act, did not reflect balanced geopolitical representation.\n\nThe latest requests came about 48 hours after the president, in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources, triggered Section 53(1) of the PIA, directing the incorporation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited and approving the formation of a new board, which would be headed by Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\n\nBuhari requested amendment to Sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b), which provide for the administrative structure of the PIA 2021, to increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six on the upstream as well as midstream and downstream boards. He noted that doing so would foster national unity and provide a sense of participation and inclusion to almost every section of the country in the decision-making of strategic institutions, such as the oil industry.\n\nIn addition, the president proposed the deletion of sections 11(2)(f), 11(2)(g), 34(2)(f) and 34(2)(g) from the Act, which would see the removal of the ministries of petroleum resources and finance from both boards.\n\nBuhari wrote in the letter to the upper chamber, \u201cThe proposed amendments will increase the membership of the board from nine to 13 members, that is, representing 44 per cent expansion of the board size. This composition would strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\u201d\n\nOn the removal of the two ministries from the boards of the agencies, the president explained that they already had clear-cut roles and could carry out those responsibilities without necessarily being on the boards.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or inter-governmental relations,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThey can continue to perform such roles without being on the board.\u201d he added, maintaining, \u201cIt is also important to note that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be directors \u2013 being same rank with directors in the institutions. This may bring some complications in some decision making, especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nBuhari also sought amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) of the PIA, which would see them being replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the board of the commission or authority under Section 2 shall be made by the president, while those made pursuant to Subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of the section shall be subject to confirmation by the senate.\n\nBuhari further requested that Section 41(2) of the PIA be replaced with a new section to read, \u201cThere shall be five executive directors for the authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the federal civil service.\u201d\n\nIn his proposed amendments, the president underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments, arguing that this will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for their employees.\n\n\u201cIn future, these positions will obviously be filled by the workers in the authority through career progression in conformity with the rules and regulations of the federal civil service,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn the letters to the senate, the president said he was acting in accordance with the provisions of the different laws governing the establishments.\n\nFor the upstream, the president nominated Isa Ibrahim Modibbo as Chairman, while Mr. Gbenga Komolafe was selected as Chief Executive Officer. Hassan Gambo was chosen as Executive Commissioner, Finance and Accounts, while Ms. Rose Ndong was nominated Executive Commissioner, Exploration and Acreage Management.\n\nThe president retained Mr. Sarki Auwalu, who currently heads the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), as Chief Executive Officer of the proposed midstream and downstream authority. He listed Chairman of the authority as Idaere Gogo Ogan; Abiodun Adeniji as Executive Director, Finance and Accounts; and Ogbugo Ukoha as Executive Director, Distributions Systems, Storage and Retail Infrastructure.\n\nBuhari also sent to the upper chamber for screening and possible approval a list of nominees for the board of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe nominees for the EFCC board are George Ekpungu, Secretary to the Commission (Cross River); Lukman Muhammed (Edo); Anumba Adaeze (Enugu); Alhaji Kola Adesina (Kwara); and Alhaji Yahaya Muhammad (Yobe).\n\nBuhari urged the senate to consider and confirm the nominees in an expeditious manner, given the important role they will play in the current administration.\n\nA profile of the CEO of the upstream commission, Komolafe, obtained by THISDAY showed that he had been deeply involved in strategic policy formulation and implementation in the oil and gas industry for about 27 years.\n\nKomolafe is an expert in institutional process study and designs for curbing revenue leakages and attaining optimum national productivity. He has initiated and coordinated various policies that generated and saved the country billions of dollars in his various capacities and national assignments.\n\nThe 57-year-old engineer from Ondo State was Managing Director, Nigeria Pipeline and Storage Company (NPSC), where he initiated the reform and business model for maintenance and operations of NNPC pipelines and depot infrastructure efficiently on private Joint Venture (JV) basis. This saved Nigeria monies that had perennially been expended on national downstream petroleum assets maintenance, operations and security.\n\nIn addition, he was Group General Manager, Special Duties at the NNPC; Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division; and Executive Director (Commercial) Pipelines and Petroleum Marketing Company (PPMC). He was also General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF); and General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), among several other positions.\n\nAside being an engineer, Komolafe has degrees in law, as well as industrial and labour relations, and a recipient of various awards.\n\nBoth chambers of the National Assembly had before embarking on their annual vacation in July passed the harmonised version of the long awaited legislation, before transmitting it to the president for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The management of the University of Lagos, Akoka is enmeshed in controversies over allegations of misappropriation of funds to the tune of N5 billion, forgery, and misconduct, among other administrative vices.\n\n\n\nOluwatoyin Ogundipe was removed as Vice-Chancellor of the institution courtesy of the allegations and petitions against the management but was reinstated by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nProf Oluwatoyin Ogundipe\n\nFollowing his reinstatement, the chairman of the governing council of the school, Wale Babalakin resigned from his position.\n\nAnti-corruption agencies such as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) were called in to investigate but they have been accused of not doing anything to bring the guilty parties to justice.\n\nAn investigation by Ripples Nigeria has revealed that the management of the school awarded large sums of monies in questionable contracts to companies, and entities that were in some cases untraceable.\n\nAlso, some of the projects were not done.\n\nFor instance, a sum of N49.43 million was spent on the renovation of the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s lodge in 2017. In 2018, another N2.2 million was expended for refurbishing the guest chalet in the same lodge, while an extra N550, 284 was spent on acquiring furniture for the building.\n\nIn 2019, the university spent another N2.04 million on refurbishing the lodge while spending the same amount in 2020.\n\nThe report reveals that within three years, the University of Lagos' management spent N55 million on the Vice-Chancellor's lodge only.\n\nThe sum of N41.82 million was also spent in 2017 on the renovation of the bursar\u2019s apartment while N16.12 million was spent on renovating the residence of the director of works (former residence for the school's registrar).\n\nTaiwo and Sons Enterprises, one of the contractors that handled the renovation of the pro-chancellor\u2019s residence had not been registered on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) website.\n\nHowever, similar organisations were inactive on the CAC portal, having failed to file their returns, investigation reveals.\n\nOthers were registered outside the date of execution of the contract for the renovation of the Pro-chancellor\u2019s lodge. The renovation was worth over one million naira.\n\nThe approval limit of the Vice-Chancellor is N2.5 million for goods and services. However, Professor Ogundipe was accused of failing to seek approval for funds outside the limit permitted for his office.\n\nFor instance, the university administration consistently spent several millions of naira on the renovation of residential buildings for its top officials constantly for several years.\n\nIn one case, a total of N112 million was spent on the renovation of principal officers\u2019 quarters. But the Tenders board limit is put at N50 million. The Vice-Chancellor in his defence, noted that deficiencies that gave room for snakes and rodents' invasion made the increments of over N50 million naira necessary.\n\n\u201cThe renovation work includes both civil works and housing furniture. In accordance with the Memorandum of appointment (MOA), outgoing VCs leave with their furniture. Consequently, the total furniture stated in the report should be broken down into renovations and purchase of furniture and equipment respectively. On assumption of office, after evaluation of the state of the property, the Works and Physical Planning Department identified certain deficiencies that needed attention. For example, leaking roof, old louvres (which gave opportunity for rodents and snakes ingress),\u201d he stated.\n\nA top member of the dissolved governing council of the University also confirmed the findings, noting that efforts to ensure accountability in this case failed.\n\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor was also accused by the former governing council of Wale Babalakin of paying the Dean of student affairs over N2 million monthly as security vote, between May 2017 and September 2018. The council alleged that the payment was done without its knowledge. However, the Vice-Chancellor noted that the payment was historical as according to him, previous deans enjoyed the same benefit.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor was also accused of approving allowances for foreign grants above his approval limit, including adding a \u2019Local Running\u2019 or \u2018Incidental expenses\u2019, which the governing council said is illegal in the varsity system.\n\nChecks revealed that inactive companies, or those not listed on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) portal were in operation with the University of Lagos.\n\nAn inactive company is one that has not made any Significant Accounting Transaction during the last two financial years or has not filed Financial Statements and Annual Returns during the last two financial years.\n\nThe new CAMA law of 2020 classified many of such organisations as inactive.\n\nA non-listed company in this case is one that cannot be found on the CAC portal.\n\nOne of such is Mr Wash Nigeria Limited. Although registered in 2003, the company was listed as inactive by the CAC. Despite this, Mr Wash Nigeria was the one that handled a N33.62 million project for the varsity.\n\nThe Project details include; Maintenance Service Contract for the Hostel Facilities in Eni-Njoku Hall, Makama Bida Hall, Fagunwa Hall, Madam Tinubu and Shodeinde Hall.\n\nThe contract awarded to Mr Wash generated controversies as the works committee department noted that it was not allowed to supervise the contract or determine if it was executed.\n\nMr Wash must have been listed as inactive due to its inability to file returns. However, in January 2020, the organisation made a request for payment valuation certificate (a payment certificate is to inform the client about release of payment to the contractor) for the sum of N33.618 million. During the duration of their inactiveness, the organization still made transaction with the University of Lagos.\n\nAttempts to reach Mr Wash Nigeria proved abortive as the organisation did not have a known website or any readily available contact details online.\n\nAnother organisation that got contracts from the University of Lagos was Myne Maxima Treasure, which was also listed as inactive on the CAC portal.\n\n\n\nThe project was for the Procurement of external electrical power back\u2013up system.\n\nEarlier, one Professor Oye Boniface had alleged that the project had no letter of award and that it was reported as completed in November 2018.\n\nIt was alleged that there was no Tender Board approval, no Finance and General Committee nor Council approval. This is a violation of the Public Procurement Act of 2007 and the University Financial Regulations of 2016.\n\nA legal expert, Barrister Awosusi Kehinde (Esq), has, however explained that the normal process of winning contracts involves preparing Tax clearance.\n\n\u201cYou cannot take contracts from government because after filing your annual returns, you are expected to get a tax clearance certificate from the Federal Inland Revenue Service and you get a certificate of your annual return from the corporate affairs commission. That is when you are eligible to be awarded any contract. The annual return is duly signed by an accountant, a practicing accountant preferred to be a chartered accountant\u201d, Awosusi noted.\n\nSpeaking further, he said it was the duty of the organisation awaeding the contract to demand a tax clearance certificate for the year ending.\n\nHe also noted that for an organisation to have been listed as inactive on the CAC portal, they must have failed to file their returns for at least two years.\n\nAnother company, Dutum Company Limited was awarded a contract worth over one billion naira, for the construction of the university\u2019s new library. Checks however revealed that Dutum has been listed as inactive by the corporate affairs commission, meaning that it failed to file its returns.\n\nContract award was worth N1.94 billion while N444.61 million representing 21% of contract completion was recorded to have been paid. The project was recorded as a failed one.\n\nAn Investigative Panel set up by the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) invited all the parties to probe causes of the failure of the project.\n\nAlso, the varsity governing council in a report seen by the newspaper had faulted the process that led to the emergence of Dutum as the organisation to build the varsity\u2019s library.\n\nThe Panel was of the view that Dutum Company Limited was not qualified to be awarded the contract for construction of the new library project. It stated that the organisation should not have been prequalified, as \u201cits lack of experience in the construction of multi-storey building on pile foundation was manifested in the course of implementation of the contract\u201d.\n\nThe contract was inherited by the administration of Professor Ogundipe from the former Vice Chancellor, Professor R. A. Bello\n\nWhen contacted, the director of Dutum, Tope Runsewe did not deny receiving over N400 million from the University of Lagos. He noted that the payment was in line with standard practices. He however denied that the project had failed, blaming \u2018hyper-inflation of construction materials\u2019 among other issues for the delay\n\n\u201cThe project in question cannot at this stage be qualified a failure. In truth, there has been some delays on the project due to reasons beyond our control. These include internal adjustments on the part of the project owner, Covid-19 related shutdowns, hyper-inflation of construction materials, which resulted in the need for price review, amongst others.\n\n\u201cDespite these, we are making progress towards resumption and continuation of the project. We remain hopeful that work should resume within weeks so we can deliver another quality project as we have been engaged to do,\u201d Runsewe said.\n\nThe project which was inaugurated in 2016 has experienced delay five years down the lane. The organisation was given an Advanced Payment in November 2016 to the tune of over N290 million.\n\nIn December 2017, another N94.358 million was made. In January 2018, a sum of N25.84 million was paid to Dutum. In June 2018, N20.82 million was paid to Dutum, and in August 2018, another sum of N13.33 million was paid.\n\nThe total is N444.61 million and it represents 22.95 percent of the total project money.\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by Ripples Nigeria showed that the University of Lagos spent over N32 million on perimeter fencing, however, checks and visits to the project revealed sparse work going on and signs of abandonment.\n\nThe contractor, Unilag Consult is an organisation with the University of Lagos, which holds 99% of its shares while University of Lagos Holding has 1%.\n\nAccording to the description of service rendered by the organisation on its official website, the organisation describes itself as one which renders consultancy services.\n\n\u201cUnilag Consult is not only able to offer comprehensive, flexible and well-coordinated consultancy services, but it also has the capability and capacity to put together, in a timely manner, a multi-disciplinary team to meet all the specified requirements for providing an effective technical support\u201d the website of the organisation reads.\n\n\n\nWhen Ripples Nigeria spoke to a worker at the location, he told the newspaper that \u201cthey (workers) were waiting for certain things for work to commence further at the site of the building\u201d.\n\nIn 2010, there was a legal dispute between the Eleye family and the University of Lagos authorities over a parcel of land at Balogun Street Extension in Iwaya area of Yaba. Documents seen by this newspaper also confirmed this development. This however, did not stop the varsity from paying over N32 million (N32,508,416.00) to Unilag Consult for the construction of the fence. The total contract award sum was N57,264,158.52.\n\n\n\nThe renovation of facilities at the varsity\u2019s sports centre was contracted to Enbridge Engineering Nigeria Limited with over N29 million paid. But the poor state of the sports facility was observed during a visit there.\n\nThe contract details include rehabilitation of main pavilion with replaced roofing sheets, reconstructed damaged seating slabs, new 800 units plastic seats, restructuring and resurfacing of basketball courts including rehabilitation of 3 tennis courts.\n\n\n\nThe works department of the varsity led by Engineer Oloko Babatunde had described the project as failed while recommending termination of the contract.\n\nA top staff of the institution also in the know of the contract told this reporter that the Vice Chancellor changed the internal staff responsible for the project.\n\nEnbridge is also inactive on the Corporate Affairs Commission portal.\n\nOver N400 million spent on cleaning (Janitorial) services in three years\n\nDocuments seen by this newspaper revealed that the university spent over N466.72 million on cleaning services within 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe sum which is under a Janitorial contract was for different faculties and departments.\n\nJanitorial Services for Faculties and Libraries which had an effective date from May 2017 was put at a contract sum of N51, 263,215.22.\n\nAnother sum of N79,787,449.10 was the contract sum for Provision of Waste Management and Cleaning Services.\n\nThe contract expired on September 30, 2017.\n\nOver N57,372,050.44 was paid after the contract expired for cleaning services.\n\nA contract sum of over N75,200,000 for Facilities Maintenance and Janitorial Services of Students\u2019 Halls of Residence was paid. This expired on October 31, 2017.\n\nAfter the expiration of the contract, another payment of N71,789,428.76 was made.\n\nFor Janitorial Services for Faculties & Library which expired in April 2018, a contract sum of N51,263,215.22 was paid, with payment after contract expired totalling N7,802,312.62.\n\nJanitorial Services for Auditoria, Sport Centre, Centre for Information Technology (CITS) and Medical Centre which expired on 30th November, 2017 had contract sum of N50,047,659.96. Payment after contract expired was N19,232,931.62 and another N2,964,046.72, totalling N22,196,978.\n\nAttempts to reach the University Vice Chancellor, Toyin Ogundipe proved abortive as he did not answer his calls nor respond to text messages.\n\nHowever, his personal assistant, Bolarin Ajigboye said the office of the Vice-Chancellor was not aware of any anomaly in its records.",

However, in January 2020, the organisation made a request for payment valuation certificate (a payment certificate is to inform the client about release of payment to the contractor) for the sum of N33.618 million. During the duration of their inactiveness, the organization still made transaction with the University of Lagos.\n\nAttempts to reach Mr Wash Nigeria proved abortive as the organisation did not have a known website or any readily available contact details online.\n\nAnother organisation that got contracts from the University of Lagos was Myne Maxima Treasure, which was also listed as inactive on the CAC portal.\n\n\n\nThe project was for the Procurement of external electrical power back\u2013up system.\n\nEarlier, one Professor Oye Boniface had alleged that the project had no letter of award and that it was reported as completed in November 2018.\n\nIt was alleged that there was no Tender Board approval, no Finance and General Committee nor Council approval. This is a violation of the Public Procurement Act of 2007 and the University Financial Regulations of 2016.\n\nA legal expert, Barrister Awosusi Kehinde (Esq), has, however explained that the normal process of winning contracts involves preparing Tax clearance.\n\n\u201cYou cannot take contracts from government because after filing your annual returns, you are expected to get a tax clearance certificate from the Federal Inland Revenue Service and you get a certificate of your annual return from the corporate affairs commission. That is when you are eligible to be awarded any contract. The annual return is duly signed by an accountant, a practicing accountant preferred to be a chartered accountant\u201d, Awosusi noted.\n\nSpeaking further, he said it was the duty of the organisation awaeding the contract to demand a tax clearance certificate for the year ending.\n\nHe also noted that for an organisation to have been listed as inactive on the CAC portal, they must have failed to file their returns for at least two years.\n\nAnother company, Dutum Company Limited was awarded a contract worth over one billion naira, for the construction of the university\u2019s new library. Checks however revealed that Dutum has been listed as inactive by the corporate affairs commission, meaning that it failed to file its returns.\n\nContract award was worth N1.94 billion while N444.61 million representing 21% of contract completion was recorded to have been paid. The project was recorded as a failed one.\n\nAn Investigative Panel set up by the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) invited all the parties to probe causes of the failure of the project.\n\nAlso, the varsity governing council in a report seen by the newspaper had faulted the process that led to the emergence of Dutum as the organisation to build the varsity\u2019s library.\n\nThe Panel was of the view that Dutum Company Limited was not qualified to be awarded the contract for construction of the new library project. It stated that the organisation should not have been prequalified, as \u201cits lack of experience in the construction of multi-storey building on pile foundation was manifested in the course of implementation of the contract\u201d.\n\nThe contract was inherited by the administration of Professor Ogundipe from the former Vice Chancellor, Professor R. A. Bello\n\nWhen contacted, the director of Dutum, Tope Runsewe did not deny receiving over N400 million from the University of Lagos. He noted that the payment was in line with standard practices. He however denied that the project had failed, blaming \u2018hyper-inflation of construction materials\u2019 among other issues for the delay\n\n\u201cThe project in question cannot at this stage be qualified a failure. In truth, there has been some delays on the project due to reasons beyond our control. These include internal adjustments on the part of the project owner, Covid-19 related shutdowns, hyper-inflation of construction materials, which resulted in the need for price review, amongst others.\n\n\u201cDespite these, we are making progress towards resumption and continuation of the project. We remain hopeful that work should resume within weeks so we can deliver another quality project as we have been engaged to do,\u201d Runsewe said.\n\nThe project which was inaugurated in 2016 has experienced delay five years down the lane. The organisation was given an Advanced Payment in November 2016 to the tune of over N290 million.\n\nIn December 2017, another N94.358 million was made. In January 2018, a sum of N25.84 million was paid to Dutum. In June 2018, N20.82 million was paid to Dutum, and in August 2018, another sum of N13.33 million was paid.\n\nThe total is N444.61 million and it represents 22.95 percent of the total project money.\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by Ripples Nigeria showed that the University of Lagos spent over N32 million on perimeter fencing, however, checks and visits to the project revealed sparse work going on and signs of abandonment.\n\nThe contractor, Unilag Consult is an organisation with the University of Lagos, which holds 99% of its shares while University of Lagos Holding has 1%.\n\nAccording to the description of service rendered by the organisation on its official website, the organisation describes itself as one which renders consultancy services.\n\n\u201cUnilag Consult is not only able to offer comprehensive, flexible and well-coordinated consultancy services, but it also has the capability and capacity to put together, in a timely manner, a multi-disciplinary team to meet all the specified requirements for providing an effective technical support\u201d the website of the organisation reads.\n\n\n\nWhen Ripples Nigeria spoke to a worker at the location, he told the newspaper that \u201cthey (workers) were waiting for certain things for work to commence further at the site of the building\u201d.\n\nIn 2010, there was a legal dispute between the Eleye family and the University of Lagos authorities over a parcel of land at Balogun Street Extension in Iwaya area of Yaba. Documents seen by this newspaper also confirmed this development. This however, did not stop the varsity from paying over N32 million (N32,508,416.00) to Unilag Consult for the construction of the fence. The total contract award sum was N57,264,158.52.\n\n\n\nThe renovation of facilities at the varsity\u2019s sports centre was contracted to Enbridge Engineering Nigeria Limited with over N29 million paid. But the poor state of the sports facility was observed during a visit there.\n\nThe contract details include rehabilitation of main pavilion with replaced roofing sheets, reconstructed damaged seating slabs, new 800 units plastic seats, restructuring and resurfacing of basketball courts including rehabilitation of 3 tennis courts.\n\n\n\nThe works department of the varsity led by Engineer Oloko Babatunde had described the project as failed while recommending termination of the contract.\n\nA top staff of the institution also in the know of the contract told this reporter that the Vice Chancellor changed the internal staff responsible for the project.\n\nEnbridge is also inactive on the Corporate Affairs Commission portal.\n\nOver N400 million spent on cleaning (Janitorial) services in three years\n\nDocuments seen by this newspaper revealed that the university spent over N466.72 million on cleaning services within 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe sum which is under a Janitorial contract was for different faculties and departments.\n\nJanitorial Services for Faculties and Libraries which had an effective date from May 2017 was put at a contract sum of N51, 263,215.22.\n\nAnother sum of N79,787,449.10 was the contract sum for Provision of Waste Management and Cleaning Services.\n\nThe contract expired on September 30, 2017.\n\nOver N57,372,050.44 was paid after the contract expired for cleaning services.\n\nA contract sum of over N75,200,000 for Facilities Maintenance and Janitorial Services of Students\u2019 Halls of Residence was paid. This expired on October 31, 2017.\n\nAfter the expiration of the contract, another payment of N71,789,428.76 was made.\n\nFor Janitorial Services for Faculties & Library which expired in April 2018, a contract sum of N51,263,215.22 was paid, with payment after contract expired totalling N7,802,312.62.\n\nJanitorial Services for Auditoria, Sport Centre, Centre for Information Technology (CITS) and Medical Centre which expired on 30th November, 2017 had contract sum of N50,047,659.96. Payment after contract expired was N19,232,931.62 and another N2,964,046.72, totalling N22,196,978.\n\nAttempts to reach the University Vice Chancellor, Toyin Ogundipe proved abortive as he did not answer his calls nor respond to text messages.\n\nHowever, his personal assistant, Bolarin Ajigboye said the office of the Vice-Chancellor was not aware of any anomaly in its records.",
          "summary": "In 2019, the university spent another N2.04 million on refurbishing the lodge while spending the same amount in 2020.\nAnother sum of N79,787,449.10 was the contract sum for Provision of Waste Management and Cleaning Services.\nA contract sum of over N75,200,000 for Facilities Maintenance and Janitorial Services of Students\u2019 Halls of Residence was paid.\nFor Janitorial Services for Faculties & Library which expired in April 2018, a contract sum of N51,263,215.22 was paid, with payment after contract expired totalling N7,802,312.62.\nJanitorial Services for Auditoria, Sport Centre, Centre for Information Technology (CITS) and Medical Centre which expired on 30th November, 2017 had contract sum of N50,047,659.96.",

          "title": "Value-Added Tax Controversy Shows Why Nigerian Government Should Diversify Economy \u2014 Political Movement",
          "text": "The Peoples Alternative Political Movement (TPAPM) says the recent controversy over the collection of Value-Added Taxes should inform the decision of the Nigerian government to consider the diversification of the economy.\n\nAccording to the group, some states appear to be poorer than others despite the mineral resources they possess.\n\nIt stated this in a statement issued by the TPAP-M leaders, Jaye Gaskia and Omotoye Olorode on Wednesday.\n\nTPAP-M said contrary to the interpretation that the recent legal victory recorded by the Rivers State Government in the struggle over the collection of VAT had widened the north-south dichotomy, it has implications for the revenue of the majority of the states and local governments in the northern and southern parts of the country.\n\nThe group urged the government to consider not only diversifying the economy but also ensuring justice is served in cases of money laundering.\n\nIt said this would go a long way in recovering funds that have otherwise been looted.\n\nIt further decried the problem of insecurity in the country as well as the decay in governance despite Muhammadu Buhari's claims that he had come to fight corruption.\n\nTPAP-M noted that the Buhari administration has failed woefully by subjecting citizens to hardship as the apex bank continues devaluing the naira through dollarisation while claiming inflation is under control.\n\nThe statement reads partly: \u201cNo doubt, the VAT controversy has challenged the federal government, state and local governments to stop paying lip service to the diversification of the economy.\n\n\u201dThe majority of public enterprises have been run aground by the ruling class. Not a few factories have either shut down or relocated to neighbouring countries due to lack of electricity and the exorbitant cost of doing business in Nigeria. This means loss of thousands of jobs and dwindling revenue including VAT and other taxes.\n\n\u201cWe insist that there is no state in Nigeria that cannot generate enough adequate revenue to address the challenge of infrastructural decay and lack of social amenities.\n\n\u201dFor instance, gold and other solid minerals are illegally mined and exported from Nigeria on a daily basis. It was reported that Nigeria lost $3 billion to illegal gold mining between 2012 and 2018.\n\n\u201cThe losses have multiplied with the connivance of public officers including security personnel. During an investigative hearing by a Senate committee last week, the Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, accused the elite of undermining the country\u2019s tottering economy by aiding and abetting gold smuggling and illegal mining to the tune of $9 billion yearly.\n\n\u201cThe Minister revealed that smuggling is now carried out by some private jet owners. The bulk of the smuggled gold is produced in Zamfara State. Yet, it is one of the poorest states in Nigeria!\n\n\u201cHave we asked why the revenue generated from the mining sector is largely withheld from the Federation Account and cornered by a few unpatriotic elements and their foreign collaborators?\n\n\u201cHave we paid attention to the fact that the mining companies are killing innocent people and destroying the environment in many states without any reclamation plans?\n\n\u201cWhy have the police and other security agencies failed to arrest and prosecute the highly placed criminal elements?\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) says that Nigeria consumes 38 million of litres of fuel per day while the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation claims that the figure is 103 million litres due to the criminal activities of smugglers.\n\n\u201cThis means that 45 million litres of fuel imported by NNPC are daily stolen and smuggled out of Nigeria. Thus, hundreds of billions of Naira are diverted from the Federation Account by the NNPC to fund the alleged smuggling of fuel to neighbouring countries. Instead of ending smuggling of imported fuel and solid minerals including gold, the government prefers to increase the pump price of petroleum products and electricity tariff.\"\n\nIt recalled that Nigeria was once the \"largest producer of palm kernel and cocoa in the world\".\n\n\"Today, both products sell much more than crude oil in the international market. In the past, Nigeria was self sufficient in food production,\" it added.\n\nIt continued, \u201dToday, Nigeria spends billions of dollars on food importation. The situation has been compounded by abduction of farmers and destruction of farms by armed herders and terrorists. The implication is that Nigeria will spend much more on food importation this year and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has continued to sabotage the national economy by resorting to the reckless devaluation of the national currency through dollarisation. Even though $1 is now exchanged for N560, the CBN says that the Naira has not found its actual value. It is common knowledge that the costs of food and other items have gone out of control but the CBN claims that inflation is under control.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has resorted to borrowing to pay salaries while many states and local governments are owing arrears of salaries for over two years. The Federal Government has continued to mortgage the future of hapless citizens by piling up external loans. Yet the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Finance claim that the economy has continued to record growth!\n\n\u201cASCAB recently wrote to the Federal Government to recover N94 trillion which has been diverted, withheld or stolen from the Federation Account. The Federal Government did not dispute the claim but did not acknowledge the letter.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration has since abandoned the fight against corruption which is one of its cardinal programmes. The politicians charged with looting the treasury to the tune of several billions of Naira have decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in order to have the criminal charges against them dropped as they have been completely forgiven.\n\n\u201cOnce the corruption cases are withdrawn from the courts the corrupt opportunists will keep their loot. Whatever may be the outcome of the case being pursued in court by the Rivers State Government, VAT collected from the people should not be increased for any reason whatsoever.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is recommended that banks and other financial institutions\n\nbe made to contribute substantially to VAT. Furthermore, as FIRS and NCS are public institutions that are performing their statutory duties there is no justification for allowing them to deduct from the revenue from VAT. More so that the Federal Government is allocated 15% of the revenue from VAT.\u201d",

          "text": "Six southern states are yet to sign the anti-open grazing bill despite the September 1 deadline that was fixed for the enactment of the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 11, governors of the 17 southern states resolved to ban open grazing and the movement of cattle by foot in order to curb clashes between farmers and herders in the region.\n\nThe decision of the governors was announced after a meeting in Asaba, the Delta state capital. The governors said the decision was taken as part of efforts to improve security in the region.\n\n\u201cThe forum observed that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits in the southern part of the country has created a severe security challenge, such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities, leading to threats to food supply and general security. Consequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across southern Nigeria,\u201d Rotimi Akeredolu, chairman of the forum, had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the resolution was met with mixed reactions in the country, with the presidency and a number of stakeholders opposing the move.\n\nThe presidency had said the proposed plan was of \u201cquestionable legality\u201d and that it will not solve the farmer-herder clashes while Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), also faulted the decision of the southern governors and likened the resolution to prohibiting spare parts trading in the north.\n\nIn spite of the dust raised by the proposed plan, Akeredolu had insisted that their decision was irreversible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what has happened since the 17 southern governors made the resolution? At a follow-up meeting in Lagos, in July, the governors set September 1 as the deadline for the enactment of the law.\n\nWhile some states already had the law in place, others are still in the process of passing the bill.\n\nSTATES THAT HAVE ENACTED THE LAW\n\nBefore the resolution of the governors, the anti-open grazing law was already operational in Ekiti, Ebonyi, Abia, Oyo, and Bayelsa states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRivers and Ondo states joined the others in prohibiting open grazing on August 19 and 31 respectively.\n\nEnugu, Akwa-Ibom, Osun and Lagos later enacted the law after the deadline.\n\nSTATES THAT HAVE PASSED THE BILL BUT AWAITING GOVERNORS\u2019 ASSENT\n\nTheCable understands that the Ogun state house of assembly is still awaiting the governor\u2019s assent as a bill to regulate animal grazing and establishment of cattle ranches in designated areas across the state was passed on July 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn September 14, the Delta house of assembly also passed the bill for a law prohibiting open grazing, indiscriminate breeding, rearing, and marketing of livestock.\n\nThe passage of the bill followed a motion for the third reading moved by Ferguson Onwo, the majority leader of the house.\n\nThe passage of the bill followed a motion for the third reading moved by Ferguson Onwo, the majority leader of the house.\n\nWhile in Anambra, the bill passed the first reading at the state house of assembly on September 22.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSTATES THAT ARE NOT SHOWING SIGNS OF ENACTING THE LAW ANYTIME SOON\n\nDespite the resolution, Edo, Cross River and Imo states are somewhat reluctant about enacting the law.\n\nGodwin Obaseki, Edo governor, has not sent the bill to the state house of assembly for consideration while Ben Ayade, Cross River governor, has reportedly refused to sign a 2017 anti-grazing bill that was passed by the state house of assembly.\n\nWhile speaking with journalists in August, Hope Uzodimma, Imo governor, had said the state had no law against open grazing. The governor had said what the state does is to regulate grazing activities under a partnership between the farmers and herders.\n\nBut Duru Johnson, spokesman of the state assembly, countered Uzodinma, saying the state had a law against open grazing and that it was assented to by Achike Udenwa, a former governor of the state.",

          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone.

According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges dead people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCDC Group\u2019s $50.9m commitment\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s digital energy\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB\u2019s partnership\n\nCDC\u2019s $50.9m commitment to Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick O\u2019Donohoe, CDC Group CEO. Image source: Nairametrics\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? CDC Group, a UK-based development finance institution (DFI) and impact investor, has announced a $50.9 million commitment to Africa\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the CDC Group website, the commitment is to \u201cexpand digital infrastructure, boost rural connectivity and accelerate digital technology access for rural and underserved communities across sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the amount, $40 million will go to the Convergence Partners Digital Infrastructure Fund (CPDIF), an investment management firm that\u2019ll invest the fund in data centres, fibre networks, 5G technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT).\n\nThe remaining $10.9 million will go into expanding Africa Mobile Networks\u2019 (AMN) infrastructure. AMN is the fifth-largest independent tower company operating in Africa. This investment will help expand its mobile network to more rural areas.\n\nWhy does this matter? According to CDC Group\u2019s Managing Director and Head of Private Equity Funds, Clarisa De Franco, digital inclusion will create many opportunities in Africa.\n\nPer Global System for Mobile Communications Association\u2019s (GSMA) mobile Internet connectivity 2020 fact sheet, 270 million out of 1.1 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa are connected to mobile Internet, leaving 930 million without a mobile Internet connection.\n\nWill CDC Group\u2019s $50.9 million commitment close this wide gap soon?\n\nDigitising energy with ZOLA Electric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Digest Africa\n\nWith about 600 million people out of 1.07 billion in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity, lack of power in Africa continues to impair economic growth.\n\nAlthough some parts of the continent have high connection rates to a power grid, they don\u2019t translate to a constant electricity supply.\n\nNigeria is a good case in point. According to Afrobarometer, the country has a 90% connection rate, but the rate of power supply stands at 17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica-focused ZOLA Electric wants to solve this problem with its smart batteries. They not only store power from sources including solar and power grids but also manage power and give real-time information on consumption.\n\nThe idea for the company, which currently serves over 1.5 million people in Africa, was conceived in a Malawian fishing village\n\nRead the story here: Tesla-backed ZOLA Electric is solving Africa\u2019s energy shortage by digitising energy\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB partnership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? African payments gateway company, Flutterwave, has partnered with 9PSB, a Payment Service Bank (PSB) and a subsidiary of 9mobile, to facilitate seamless financial services in Nigeria.\n\nPer Flutterwave\u2019s blog, companies will launch a \u201csuite of products\u201d together. Branka Mracajac, 9PSB\u2019s CEO, says, \u201cexisting agents, partners, and customers will have a single point of entry to enjoy various products and services provided by Flutterwave.\u201d\n\nShe adds that both companies are committed to delivering financial solutions to the unbanked, under-banked, and underserved.\n\nSpeaking of the unbanked, 9PSB was one of the three PSBs the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) approved in August 2020 to boost financial inclusion. The others are Hope PSB and Moneymaster PSB.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), as of September 18, 2021, only 50 million of Nigeria\u2019s adult population of 105.8 million had their Bank Verification Number (BVN).\n\nWhile the introduction of PSBs by the CBN was meant to deepen financial inclusion, the entry requirements and limitations for PSBs, according to the current guidelines, makes it difficult.\n\nYou might want to revisit: Why Payment Service Banks could face an uphill battle in the Nigerian market\n\nAlso: Why Payment Service Banks might not impact Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion drive\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB\u2019s partnership might be a way to circumvent the limitations of PSBs as they look to impact Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion drive.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\niPad Mini 2021 Review: Pocketable Power!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is the flagship project of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 which was founded via a comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the principal aim of integrating Africa\u2019s market.\n\nRemarkably, AfCFTA is potentially the largest free trade area in the world with the capacity to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty by connecting over 1.3 billion people across 55 countries having a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of about US$3.4 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement establishing AfCFTA (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) was signed on 21st March 2018 but came into force on 30th May 2019 following the deposit of the instruments of ratification by 24 countries. As of April 19, 2021, 54 countries have signed the Agreement while 36 countries (including Nigeria) have deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson. Notably, trading under the AfCFTA Agreement officially commenced on January 1, 2021, subject to negotiations on protocols and instruments of trade.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement has three layers comprising the AfCFTA Agreement itself which serves as a framework agreement, the Protocols and the Annexes, Guidelines, and Schedules to the Protocols. The Agreement had two phases of negotiations. Under Phase I negotiations, the Protocols on Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, and Dispute Settlement entered into force concurrently with the AfCFTA Agreement. Phase II negotiations on the other hand will birth the Protocols on Investment, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and Competition Policy.\n\nIt was initially hoped that Phase II negotiations would be completed by January 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline has been delayed.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement (PDF) summarises AfCFTA\u2019s goals into eight objectives which includes, creating a single market for goods and services, creating a liberalised market for goods and services, contributing to the movement of capital and people and facilitating investment, creating a continental customs union, promoting sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development and gender equality, enhancing competitiveness of economies of State Parties and lastly resolving challenges of multiple memberships while expediting regional and continental integration process.\n\nBeyond the objectives listed in the Agreement, AfCFTA seeks to boost Africa\u2019s economic output to around $29 trillion by 2050 and increase intra-African trade by 52.3%.\n\nAfCFTA and the Nigerian IP market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Nollywood by Aimee Corrigan via Wikipedia Commons.\n\nIn recent times, the international and global economy has been driven by innovation, creativity, knowledge, and technology each of which is fundamentally supported by intellectual property (IP) and intellectual property rights (IPR).\n\nResearch has shown that countries with the largest economies are largely driven by IP. For developing countries, IP can be used to promote economic development by encouraging innovation. To encourage innovation, there must be an enabling environment safeguarded by a robust IP Policy that will ensure that creatives and investors recover the cost of investment and maximise the benefits generated from their innovations or creative work.\n\nA typical example is Nigeria which is home to a rich and dynamic creative sector, star among them the Nigerian film industry, also referred to as Nollywood. According to a 2016 IMF report, the Nigerian film industry currently accounts for \u20a6853.9 billion ($7.2 billion), or 1.42 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP and arguably the country\u2019s second-biggest source of employment after agriculture.\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, however, stretch far beyond the film industry and include activities ranging from music and publishing to computer software and the manufacturing industries; each with enormous potential for growth.\n\nDespite the obvious economic possibilities in Nigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, Nigeria does not have an IP Policy to facilitate the mainstreaming of the economic value of IP into the government\u2019s National Economic Plan. Consequently, the value of IP and IPRs are not adequately recognised and harnessed by policymakers as an important tool for national development that needs to be promoted and protected.\n\nRemarkably, the facilitation of the flow of knowledge-rich goods and services across borders have become integral considerations in development and trade policy, which is the underpinning of World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n\nThe Protocol on Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cIPR Protocol\u201d) which will be negotiated during Phase II of AfCFTA has vast possibilities for IP which must be explored. According to the World Bank, the IPR Protocol can serve as a catalyst for technology transfer, technology diffusion and the economic transformation of Africa\u2019s economy from one that is primarily resource-based, to one that is driven by knowledge, information, and ideas.\n\nWith AfCFTA, creatives and investors can have access to a larger market by extending the territorial recognition and protection of IP to its 54-signatory member territories. With an extended territorial recognition and protection of IP, creatives can exploit and maximise the value in IP by benefiting from the use of IP beyond its national territories. More so, the extension of territorial recognition and protection of IP will reduce the cost of registering and safeguarding IPR in territories of signatory members.\n\nAfCTA\u2019s extensive reach and influence can be utilised to achieve the standardisation and unification of IP policies in Africa by including a robust IP policy in the IPR Protocol which will be applicable in signatory members countries upon adoption.

          "text": "The global container shortage is beginning to take its toll on imports into Nigeria as a large volume of imports is now trapped in Asian countries, particularly India and China.\n\nForeign vessel owners are currently allocating their available scarce containers to commercially viable trade routes, such as India-United States and China-United States, rather than releasing them to load goods heading to African ports.\n\nWith this development, the volume of Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) of containers coming into Nigeria and other West African countries may decline significantly, especially now that the festive season is around the corner.\n\nThe global shortage of containers, caused by the COVID-19-induced global port congestion, has also resulted in a rise in the prices of freight such that importers who used to pay $28 per metric ton now pay between $38 and $39 per ton from the United States to Nigeria.\n\nAlso, moving a 40-foot container from India to Nigeria now costs about $15,000 instead of $3,000, plus charges by shipping companies in the past.\n\nGiving insight into the development, Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Limited, a Lagos-based clearing and forwarding firm, says no shipping company is willing to send vessels to ply either China-Africa or India-Africa routes except for cargo owners that are willing to pay the exorbitant costs for freight.\n\nRead Also: More cost for importers, exporters as foreign shipping firms slam surcharges on cargoes\n\n\u201cThere is serious congestion in ports around the globe due to the outbreak of COVID-19. There is a long wait to get containers overseas to freight goods into Nigeria, and the cost of freight has now become extremely high,\u201d Anakebe explains on phone.\n\nAccording to Anakebe, the development would seriously affect the prices of goods, especially now that the Nigerian economy is dealing with a high inflation rate.\n\nHe says no shipping line is ready to invest in the production of new containers, especially now that there is a global economic downturn where many businesses are running at loss.\n\nThe development has become a source of concern to Nigerian shippers due to the fact that it has become a huge risk to invest in importation at a time like this where the table may turn, and the freight crashes, he states.\n\n\u201cThe development is being compounded by the fact that empty containers of these shipping companies are trapped in African countries and the United States. And the presence of these containers has become a menace in countries like Nigeria due to the low volume of export cargoes to move out with these containers,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe however states that shipping companies now divert their limited containers to service China-United States routes because freighting a 20-foot container from China to the United States is now as high as $23,000 due to the congestion in US ports.\n\n\u201cWe are not experiencing container shortage locally but it is affecting exporters as it has distorted a lot of transactions,\u201d says Victor Iyama, president, Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN).\n\nIyama says that it is the ships that bring in imports into Nigeria that take out exports, noting that if the import is being delayed, exporters will be unable to meet up their deadlines.\n\nIyama however expresses optimism that the situation will improve very soon, as port congestion has remained the major challenge Nigerian exporters are facing at the moment.",

We have a comprehensive plan, and we are doing our best,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe added that the country was hampered by resources, despite being oil-exporting, and that with more financial wherewithal, infrastructure works would be sped up.\n\nPresident Buhari assured the queen, who last visited Nigeria in 2017, that if she came again, she would see a lot of differences.\n\nIn the area of agriculture, the president said Nigerian borders were closed with some neighbouring countries to encourage farmers, \u201cand eat what we grow. People went back to the land, and this helped us tremendously. We made fertilizers available, resuscitated dams, and it all paid off handsomely. Otherwise, with about 200 million people, we would have been in trouble when COVID-19 struck, and affected the economy.\u201d\n\nHe said just like Oliver Twist, Nigeria could do with more help in the area of investments, particularly in agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe have the land, we have the people, capital input is what we need,\u201d President Buhari stated, adding that Nigerian farmers were quite receptive to modern ways of doing things, especially in respect of cutting post-harvest waste.\n\nQueen Zorreguieta lauded what she called \u201cthe huge effort\u201d made by Nigeria to combat the Coronavirus pandemic, saying; \u201cyou spent a great part of your GDP.\u201d\n\nShe said she had a huge commitment to Nigeria, \u201cand will want to accompany her to do more. You won\u2019t be alone. We will be there along with other partners.\u201d\n\nThe queen said agriculture was music to her ears, being the daughter of a former Minister of Agriculture, and her biggest plea would be for Nigeria to make infrastructure available so that investors and aid donors can access areas beyond the major cities.\n\n\u201cWe need roads, railways, digital financial inclusion for farmers. Government needs to digitize all payments,\u201d she said.\n\nFemi Adesina\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President\n\n(Media and Publicity)",

A situation whereby the US Dollar would appear to be on a roller-coaster against the Naira is simply unacceptable.\n\n\u201cHad the Naira to US Dollar exchange rate been stable in the last two years, most of the alleged debates about so-called recklessness against the government of President Buhari would have been long settled.\u201d\n\nLukman also said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s borrowing, both with reference to debt/GDP and debt/revenue ratio is still below the permissible economic threshold of below 60 per cent and 46 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cIf economic indices are the reference point in any comparative assessment of performance President Buhari- led administration as compared to all the PDP administrations between 1999 and 2016, PDP leaders and their supporters cannot have any voice.\u201d",

In the hall (departure lounge), a lot of Nigerians were left stranded. There are other Nigerians who are stranded and we are witnessing this first-hand and we are feeling it. Some of the citizens were abandoned here. We are raising this call for common Nigerians. Sometimes when citizens bring their complaint, it appears as if they fabricated it. But this one, we are involved and we are seeing this for ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we are leaving here and we have shown interest to find out from the Ministry of Aviation and the Consumer Protection Council what is happening to the aviation sector as soon as we return (to Abuja).\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The hospital management had denied the allegations, saying the doctors did all they could to save Mailafia\u2019s life.\n\nCredit: Punch",

And as you rightly know, obedient to court orders and court judgments.\n\n\u201cBut then you have to understand within the context of such obedience that there are associated rights and interests that are vested in the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cInclusive of rights of appealing against a judgment, inclusive of the right to file an application for setting aside the purported judgment and order.\n\n\u201cAnd indeed, inclusive of the possibility of filing a fresh action if indeed the jurisdiction of the court that was alleged to have indeed handed that judgment is an issue.\n\n\u201cSo, we are doing the needful in terms of looking at the law as it exists and then working within the context of the law in ensuring that justice is done as far as the contending issues between the parties are concerned,\u201d the minister explained.\n\nIgboho, through his lawyer, Yomi Alliyu, had filed a suit challenging the invasion of his house in Ibadan, Oyo State on July 1 by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), also known as the State Security Service (SSS) or secret police.\n\nIgboho sought an order of the court to declare the invasion of his residence by DSS operatives as illegal and an infringement on his fundamental human rights.\n\nThe three respondents are the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Malami (SAN), as the first respondent, SSS as the second respondent and Director of SSS in Oyo State as the third respondent.\n\nCounsel for the AGF, Abubakar Abdullahi had filed an application challenging the ability of a state High Court to hear the activities of Nigerian government agencies.\n\nBut citing several judgements by the Supreme and Appeal courts in respect of the ability of the state high court to hear such cases, Justice Ladiran Akintola said the invasion of the house of the applicant violated his fundamental human rights as stipulated in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this court is not a Father Christmas and cannot award the sum of N500 billion as requested by the applicant but the court retrained the respondent from arresting or harassing the applicant. He has right to his free movement as contained in section 35.1 (a)(b) of the 1999 constitution as amended,\u201d he said, awarding him N20 billion in damages.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe federal government Wednesday restated that no stone would be left unturned in its quest to prosecute Boko Haram financiers and the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nThe government also explained reasons it was yet to name and shame the alleged financiers of terrorism in the country.\n\nThe UAE list\n\nLast week, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed six Nigerians and 32 other nationals as terrorism sponsors.\n\nThe Nigerians named are Abdurrahaman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nThe report was contained in the state-owned news agency, WAM.\n\nThe country said the listed individuals and entities, including their affiliates, were being monitored.\n\nThe report read: \u201cThe UAE Cabinet has issued Resolution No 83 of 2021, designating 38 individuals and 15 entities on its approved list of persons and organisations supporting terrorism (Local Terrorist List).\n\n\u201cThe resolution underscores the UAE\u2019s commitment to target and dismantle networks that finance terrorism and its related activities.\n\n\u201cThe resolution demands that regulatory authorities monitor and identify any individuals or entities affiliated with or associated with any financial, commercial or technical relationship and take the necessary measures according to the laws in force in the country in less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nAGF assures\n\nBut Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) assured all terrorism sponsors would be brought to justice.\n\nHe spoke in an interview with journalists at the ongoing 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States of America.\n\nMalami\u2019s media aide, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, who disclosed this in a statement, also hinted that the government was currently investigating the alleged sponsors with a view to prosecuting them.\n\nHe said investigation had reached an advanced stage and a statement in that direction would be made in due course.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTime is not ripe for holistic disclosures so as not to pre-empt the investigation process. The prime object remains the attainment of peace and security of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cAs far as terrorism funding and financing is concerned, we have succeeded in identifying those that are allegedly responsible for funding same and we are blocking the leakages associated with funding while embarking on aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in terms of the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investigation is ongoing and advancing. For the purpose of investigation, I would not like to be pre-emptive in terms of making disclosures that will have effect of undermining the successes we are recording.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever we do in terms of detention and arrest is indeed backed-up by judicial processes. We have acquired and obtained legitimate court orders, taking into consideration the facts and material proof of evidence presented before the court on account of which the court eventually exercises its discretion in terms of granting orders that we can have the suspects in custody pending the conclusion of the investigation.\n\n\u201cNaming and shaming of suspects is not embarked upon as a policy by the federal government out of sheer respect to the constitutional rights of Nigerians relating to presumption of innocence. It is a product of constitutionalism and the law.\n\n\u201cIt is rooted in the law and the names of the suspects will accordingly be made public at the point of judicial arraignment while the shaming remains a consequence of judicial conviction. Trials are judicial process and not about media sensations.\n\n\u201cWhere reasonable grounds are established, suspects must be naturally taken to court at which point their identity must be disclosed and the naming become apparent. Shaming, on the other hand, is the product of conviction at which point the public are equally judicially put on notice.\n\n\u201cIn essence naming and shaming within the context of Nigerian law are judicial functions which commence with arraignment and terminate with convictions. Naming and shaming is not unguided and unregulated process. It is not like a discarded ship left at the mercy of winds and tides,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nReview of case files\n\nBlueprint reports that the OAGF is currently reviewing over one thousand Boko Haram case files out of which 285 were filed before the Federal High Court based on prima facie cases of terrorism against them.\n\nThe delay witnessed in prosecution process, according to the AGF, was occasioned by COVID-19 lockdown, Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) strike and court vacation.\n\n",

          "text": "While the super-rich in Nigeria who had stolen enough by manipulating loopholes in the public and private sector to send their wards to the best schools in Europe and America to prepare them for the ever dynamic world are doing that with impunity, the families of the downtrodden are sentenced to the public schools that educationists and policymakers said are in comatose, writes our correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\n\u201cEducation is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today\u201d. \u2013 Malcolm X\n\nThe aforesaid quote by an African-American Muslim minister, human rights activist, and spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, Mr. Malcolm X succinctly captured the philanthropic focus of Felistas Foundation\u2019s supports to indigent pupils of the agrarian community in Nsukka local government area of Enugu State\n\nRegrettably, the era of the social stratification that classified Nigerian society into three strata, and substrata in-between is far from the current reality.\n\nAccording to sociological findings, society is divided into three groupings, vis vis \u201cUpper class\u201d, \u201cMiddle class,\u201d and \u201cLower class\u201d.\n\nThe upper class according to scholars is divided into, upper and upper-lower while the lower class also has upper lower and lower-lower.\n\nRegrettably, these stratifications have been eroded by current reality as the structure had collapsed into what is known today as the super-rich and the poor.\n\nHowever, while the super-rich are now enjoying the status hitherto enjoyed by the only middle class, the lower class still maintain its original stratification of uper lower and lower lower, while the middle class has fizzled away.\n\nIt is nonetheless, instructive to explain the sociological concept uper lower and lower lower. When a family is classified to belong to uper lower, it means that the family have the capacity to navigate the basic human needs of food, shelter and clothing to even sending their kids to school to prepare them for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, those that fall within the lower lower strata are more or less confined to the circle of poverty as the status of poverty is automatic to them by birth.\n\nThose born into this class have little or no hope of moving out of poverty except by devine intervention.\n\nScholars in sociology explained further, \u201cIt takes the grace of God for a Child born into the strata to escape from the circle of poverty. This is because it is impossible, humanly speaking but being that there is nothing that is impossible with God, we made bold to say that a child born into this strata can escape from the circle by divine intervention\u201d.\n\nAdding flesh to the concept of \u201cdivine intervention,\u201d the scholars said that there is \u201csocial mobility\u201d in social stratification.\n\nSocial mobility they explained is the process where by a man or family moves from upper class to middle or lower class or vise versa.\n\nThey added that there are factors that facilities these mobility. The factors include level of income, education and and occupation. The scholars further argued that the type of job a man does is dependent on his level of education and that also determine his income at end of the month.\n\n\u201cIf a man is well educated, it influences the kind of job he does and the kind of job a man does determines his income. Therefore everything boils down to education.\n\nGiving future explanation to the divine intervention concept, the scholars, explained that unless a child born into the lower lower class can only escape poverty if a school, church, multilateral organizations, good spirited individual, or a foundation give scholarship to a child from this type of family, he is doomed to poverty.\n\nIt is however, on the premise of the foregoing that a journalist, Ikem Okuhu, has donated a total of 8,000 exercise books to 1,577 primary school pupils in the seven primary schools in Nkpunano, Nsukka, in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\nChief Okuhu in a statement said that the donation which is the third since the journalist\u2019s family launched a foundation known as Felistas Foundation three years ago in memory of their mother, Mrs. Felistas Ugwu, brings the total of exercise books donated to schools in the area to 18,000, adding that the donation is aimed at providing at least five exercise books to each of the pupils in the benefiting schools.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s donation, which had the Education Secretary of Nsukka Local Government Area, Mrs. Jane Asadu, in attendance also witnessed the donation of 2,000 biros and another 2,000 pencils from a community leader, Chief Ignatius Ugwu in support of the project,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSpeaking during the handing over ceremony, held at the Community Primary School, Nguru Nsukka, Ikem Okuhu, explained that the donation was designed to provide relief for the poor families who struggle to provide basic stationery for their children and wards in the public school system in the area.\n\nOkuhu, who is also a public relations practitioner, said the challenges faced by parents in the education of their children has continued to bother him and his family, lamenting that the continued economic downturn in the country has been having adverse impacts on the ability of parents to provide for the education of children.\n\nGoing down memory lane, he said, \u201cMy family has committed to the educational intervention as a means of sustaining the memory of our mother, who, in her lifetime, made feeding the poor in the community her major preoccupation.\n\n\u201cWhen our mother was alife, she made providing for her neighbours, especially the poor in the community her major task. Our family was such that, as hard as things was, food was considered something to share with each and everyone. As a means of sustaining this legacy, we decided in 2018 to make this donation annually, knowing how much poor parents struggle to get their children through primary education\u201d.\n\nHe also expressed delight that since the intervention began three years ago, school enrollments in the area has been on the increase and called on other public spirited individuals and groups to join in the efforts towards revitalizing the public schools in the state.\n\nOn her part, the Local Government Education Secretary, Mrs. Jane Asadu, commended the family for the initiative and urged other people to join hands with the state government in the drive to improve the fortunes of public schools in the state.\n\nAsadu commended the state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his steadfast commitment towards the revitalization of education at all levels in the state, saying the governor had since he assumed office in 2015, rebuilt hundreds of classroom blocks in all parts of the state.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has been consistent in revitalizing the school system since he assumed office. His attention has especially been on the primary school system and all over the state, he has continued to provide modern infrastructure in our schools and efforts such as this one will go a long way in supporting his efforts along this line,\u201d she stated.\n\nShe also commended the Chairman of Enugu State Universal Basic Education Board (ENSUBEB), Mr Ikeje Asogwa for all his efforts in lifting the infrastructure fortunes of primary schools in the state.\n\nAlso speaking on the occasion, community leader and Chairman of Nguru Nsukka Development Union, Chief Ignatius Ugwu, appreciated the gesture of the journalist and pledged his support and those of other leading community leaders towards the revitalization of the primary schools in the area.\n\nMr. Ugwu extolled the virtues of the late matriarch of the Okuhu family for the exemplary life she lived and urged the people of the community to strive towards leaving a lasting legacy, especially such that would leave lasting impacts long after they had passed on.\n\nIt is on the premise of this to that I confidently conclude with the words of a medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages, Maimonides, \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\u201d.",

          "text": "The resurgence of the military junta in the West African sub-region is not only reprehensible, anti-democratic and development but anti-people and disgraceful writes our Diplomatic correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nIn recent times, Mali, Niger, the Republic of Guinea , and a host of others have come under the sledgehammer of the military establishment in these countries following an inordinate attempts by the civil authorities to extend their stay in office.\n\nThough the attempted coup in the Niger Republic was not directly linked to an attempt by the outgone civilian administration to extend its reign, but observers said that the attempt was not unconnected with the effort by the outgone regime to subvert the will of the people at the poll.\n\nIt is however, regrettable to note that the solidarity enjoyed by these selfish leaders who want to perpetuate selves in government Infinitum by other leaders in the sub region under the aegis of ECOWAS is responsible for their boldness in always tinkering with the constitution of their respective states to legitimize their inordinate quest for power.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has been playing outreach with its double standard on the issue under scrutiny.\n\nFor instance, the same ECOWAS that would maintain defending silence when these parochial and selfish leaders initiates constitutional review process to allow them contest elections after serving out their constitutionally allowed terms of office would move in to sanction the military when they move in to rescue their country from the clutches of one man\u2019s inordinate ambition.\n\nTo call a spade a spade, the Economic States of West African States (ECOWAS), has not lived up to its true calling as available data reveals that it has continued to tilt toward supporting those lawless and recalcitrant President within the sub region that had altered their constitution with the view to continue in office perpetually.\n\nTruth be told, what is it that these sit tight Presidents want to achieve in office that they were unable to achieve within their constitutionally allowed terms of office to warrant an extension.\n\nThe earlier that the relevant organs of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) begin to resist attempt by incumbent presidents to amend the constitution with a view to extend their tenure through the back, the more the coup in the sub sub region would escalates.\n\nBut in all honesty, is the military in the sub region actually truncating democracy as ECOWAS and other multilateral organizations and world leaders would want the public to believe or the military are up in arm to halt the emergence of tyrants with the support of western powers to protect their economic interests in the affected states?\n\nAn objective attempt to the above questions favours the later as the military in the region is not necessarily interested in partisan politics or want to distort democracy but is not just comfortable seeing some despots and unbridled tyrants and dictators raping the democratic process in a bid to continue in office perpetually.\n\nOnly recently, the Authority of Heads of States and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), directed the President of ECOWAS Commission to begin the process of amending the 2001 Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance in order to ensure democracy, peace and stability, as well as halt the incessant coup in the sub-region.\n\nThe instruction was given in light of recent perennial coup in the region.\n\nThis is contained in a resolution reached at the Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Head of State and Government of ECOWAS held in Accra.\n\nThe Authority said that consolidation of democracy and good governance is crucial for the development, peace and stability of the ECOWAS region.\n\nThe meeting which was chaired by the President of the Republic of Ghana and Chair of\n\nthe Authority, Mr. Nana Akufo-Addo, also condemned in strong terms the decision of the transitional authorities to hire private security companies in Mali.\n\nIt further expressed great\n\nconcern about its consequences on the deterioration of the security situation in\n\nMali and the region as a whole.\n\nThe Heads of State and Government took note of the Report of the High-\n\nLevel Mission dispatched to the Republic of Guinea on 10 September 2021,\n\nfollowing the Extraordinary Session of the Authority held via videoconference on\n\n8 September 2021.\n\nThey also took note of the report on the political transition in the Republic of Mali, presented by the Mediator H.E Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\nThe Authority applauded the quality of the reports and the relevance of the\n\nrecommendations contained therein.\n\nThe Authority, after deliberations, endorsed the main recommendations\n\ncontained in the Mission\u2019s report.\n\nThe Authority reiterates its unreserved condemnation of the coup of 5\n\nSeptember 2021 and reaffirms its demand for the immediate and unconditional\n\nrelease of President Alpha Conde.\n\nIt also reminds members of the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development (CNRD) that they are individually\n\nand collectively responsible for the physical safety of President Alpha Conde.\n\nHowever, instead of waste this huge resources that ECOWAS is wasting under the guise of mediation and diplomatic mission to Mali or Guinea, prevention by way of discouraging siting President from tinkering with constitution to elongate their stay in office is less expensive.\n\nIssuing of threats and sanctions on military junta by the regional and sub regional bodies are mere rain that washes the stone.\n\nThe right thing to do is to always support the people to resist any attempt by any Presidents to change the constitution to allow him another term in office.\n\nTime shall come and that time is now when the ECOWAS authorities must wake up to its responsibility and nip this crisis in the bud once and for all.",

          "text": "As the world celebrates International Peace Day 2021 , stakeholders in the peacebuilding environment have called for workable strategies that would help resolve violent conflict in the country.\n\nInternational Day of Peace is observed across the world on September 21 every year.\n\nThe UN General Assembly declared this as a day devoted to making the ideals of peace robust.\n\nSpeaking at an outdoor event organized by the Institute of Peace and Conflict Resolution in collaboration with its partners to commemorate World Peace Day 2021, the Executive Director, CLEEN Foundation , Ms. Ruth Olofin tasked the government to design workable and realistic strategies that will help resolve the myriad conflicts confronting the country and return it on the path of peace.\n\nShe noted that local and homegrown tact and strategy are essential to resolving the crisis in Nigeria.\n\nWhile welcoming partners and stakeholders to the ceremony, the Director-General IPCR, Dr. Bakut Tswah Bakut said that the theme of this year\u2019s celebration is, \u201cRecovering better for an equitable and sustainable world.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cSo our duty as a peace institute is to continue to research on the various dynamics, and the causes and the triggers of conflict while developing consistent and dynamic policies as well as enable the government to deal with strategies that will bring about conflict mitigations. So what we have done is to directly intervene in all the political wards in the country. We are engaged in sensitization, advocacy, conflict resolution, mediation, as well as the capacity building across the seven hundred and seventy-four (774) local government areas in the country.\n\n\u201cPart of our function in IPCR is to mediate and manage various conflicts in Nigeria and Africa at large. Between the time that we were established and now, it appears that we have more conflict now than then, but that is because conflict is dynamic, when you deal with one aspect of the conflict, it metamorphoses into another form\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cAt the moment we have ten zonal offices and five of those zonal offices are actually engaged in advocacy, sensitization as well as celebration of this international day of peace. One of the things we have done this year is to ensure that communities are encouraged to silence the gun and that is why we say take responsibility. It is not just the government that would take responsibility, you as an individual have to take responsibility in making sure that the guns are silenced\u201d.\n\nThe DG also explained that the international day of peace is the United Nations UN day declared all over the world, that this particular day is a day of the ceasefire, where ever there is conflict, where ever there is war.\n\nHe further said that on this particular day, all the guns of war and conflict must be silenced.\n\nOn the significance of the day, he said that it is a day people are encouraged to silence the gun.\n\nOn his part, the Chiefs of Civil-Military Affairs (Army) Major General MG Kangye said that the presence of troops of the Nigerian Army in troubled spots in the country gives confidence to locals to go about their legitimate business without fear.\n\nRepresented by the Acting Director of Information Management, Department of Civil-Military Affairs, Colonel Kayode Ogunsanya said that the Nigerian Army under the incumbent administration has employed a non-kinetic approach to restoring peace in crisis areas in the country.\n\nHe concluded that the High Command of the Nigerian Army is prioritizing the welfare of troops.",

          "text": "The Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman has weighed in on the debate of Nigeria\u2019s debt profile, saying issues around management of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange by the Central Bank, a situation whereby the US Dollar would appear to be on a roller-coaster against the Naira is simply unacceptable.\n\nMr Lukman said so far, the debate about Nigeria\u2019s debt is based on the absolute value of the amount Nigeria owe.\n\nSalihu Lukman in a statement enumerated that, Variables of both Gross Domestic Product and revenue are ignored in the debate.\n\nHis words: \u201cWithout any doubt, some of the concerns expressed in the debate are legitimate, especially in relation to problems of exchange rate, which has further increased Nigeria\u2019s debt burden, But in terms of looking at other critical variables such as revenue profile and even performance of the economy, he says the debt debate is excessively politicised.\n\n\u201cBased on Nigeria\u2019s debt to GDP figures, arguments of previous PDP administration performing better than the current Buhari administration may appear attractive.\u201d\n\nMr salihu said part of what is largely responsible for the lower debt to revenue ratio is the reality that under the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, Federal Government is making good progress in diversifying revenue sources.\n\nIn terms of expenditure assessments, between 1999 and 2015, total expenditure increased from 947.7 billion Naira to 4,988.9 billion Naira. Recurrent expenditure in 1999 was 449.7 billion Naira, which increased to 3,831.9 billion Naira in 2015. And Comparing , between 2015 and 2019, under President Buhari, total expenditure increased to 9,714.6 billion Naira in 2019, from 4,988.9 billion Naira in 2015.\n\nIn his opinion, higher budget deficits contribute to pushing governments to borrow,Applying the same logic, expectedly lower debts should encourage governments to have more favourable balanced budgets.\n\nMr Lukman said considering all the indices of Nigeria\u2019s fiscal management between 1999 and 2020, there is an indicating factor of more prudence under the six years of President Buhari than other administration.",

          "title": "NNPC Says Global Gas Crisis May Push Oil Prices $10 Higher in Three Months",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Wednesday said the global natural gas crisis, which has resulted in rising prices, could push up oil prices by as much as $10 a barrel over the next three to six months.\n\nWholesale gas prices have surged by 250 per cent since the beginning of the year, including a 70 per cent rise, disrupting food supplies in parts of Europe and putting several energy suppliers out of business.\n\nIn Nigeria, the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), or cooking gas, has increased by more than 100 per cent in the last few months due to under-supply, according to NNPC. Although, marketers have also attributed the increase to the introduction of a 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) and rising dollar value to the naira.\n\nOver 60 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s domestic gas needs are sourced internationally, while the rest is sourced locally, even though the country sits atop a 206 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) proven quantity of the commodity.\n\nSpeaking in a conversation monitored on Bloomberg Television, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated that in the next three to six months, the current distortion in the market could lead to an increase in oil prices by at least $10. With Brent crude hitting $76 on Wednesday, the increase could actually be about $86 during the period.\n\nKyari noted that soaring gas prices would most likely seep into the oil prices because consumers would be forced to seek fuel alternatives to natural gas in the nearest future because of rising prices, as demand for oil could be boosted by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\n\u201cIt will absolutely hit crude prices as energy consumers are forced to shift from gas to other fuels,\u201d the NNPC GMD stated. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be very wrong if you said you would see an additional $10 on a barrel maybe three months, maximum six months,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the world is presently in a potential crisis because last year, a number of things were not done right, including under-investment in the gas sector, particularly.\n\nKyari said, \u201cThe implication of that is that we\u2019re going to see the effect coming up in a year or two maximum. And that will also affect the gas supply all over the globe and, particularly, in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to show up in a number of gas-rich countries and gas supply projects are being stalled, a number of midstream gas projects are being stalled or delayed, and the net effect will be that there will be an impact on pricing coming very shortly.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that there was still clearly a supply gap, stressing that in the country, supply to the Nigeria LNG plant has been beset by several challenges in recent times.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cThere are a number of things going on now to improve on the gas supply. We surely have issues around gas supply to the LNG plant, in particular, and even into the domestic market and the net effect is that you will see some slippages in cargos in 2022 and even in 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd the implication of that is that you have to do something pretty quickly and we have lost time, we have lost investment and for us, what must happen is a very quick return to a pre-Covid-19 level investment and that, of course, is being adjusted and I know that this is a key challenge for the industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyari, since in many jurisdictions, including Nigeria, gas production is tied to oil production and much of the production is associated, prices may spiral in several areas.\n\nHe stated that closing the global oil supply gap in three, four months\u2019 time might not be feasible, but noted that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance in the last few months in relation to the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be halted by the end of October this year or mid November.\n\n\u201cFrom everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ll get back to the OPEC level, probably, by the end of October and maximum middle of November. We\u2019re not far from that,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe GMD pointed out that the national oil company was going through a transformation that would see it invest more in renewable energy sources, going forward.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe are undergoing a transformation and what this means is that we\u2019re going to lead a company that will become the biggest company in Africa, not just the company that will lead the transition into renewables as we go forward to zero carbon situation.\n\n\u201cAnd what we have to do is to focus on gas development, as everybody else is doing, and also focus on the reality, which is that you need to go electric and to do this, you need a number of things done as quickly as possible to make this company completely commercial and completely profitable. It already is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the OPEC Secretary General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said current conversations around the transition to a carbon-free world were driven by sheer emotions, rather than facts and science.\n\nSpeaking on the side-lines of Gastech, an industry expo in Dubai, Barkindo stated that there were many distortions in discussing of a world without fossil fuels, with the planned focus on renewables.\n\nBarkindo said, \u201cI have also in my contribution, in my panel, talked about the distortion of facts, and the science, the misrepresentation of these facts in the conversation, which is not healthy because climate change and the energy transition are supposed to be guided by the science.\n\n\u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is supposed to be the most authoritative body with regard to both climate change and the transition. And we in OPEC, we believe they are doing a great job; they are producing very important seminal reports.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, these reports are being set aside, and the discussions ensuing at the moment, more or less, are being driven by emotions rather than by the great work that the scientific body is producing for all of us.\u201d\n\nOn the energy transition, Barkindo emphasised the vital role of oil in meeting the growing demand for energy, adding that predictable investment is required to address the increasing global needs, highlighting the need to address energy poverty and meet global commitments to expand energy access.\n\nReferencing OPEC\u2019s release of the World Oil Outlook 2021, the secretary general noted that oil and natural gas would continue to supply more than half the world\u2019s energy needs in 2045, with oil around 28 per cent, followed by gas at 24 per cent.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Ondo State Governor and Chairman, Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Wednesday, took a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Nasir El-Rufai, for criticising the legal approach adopted by the southern governors in handling the open grazing crisis, saying his statement was a ploy to externalise banditry in the country.\n\nAlso while speaking on ARISE News, Akeredolu, who told his Kaduna counterpart that the southern governors had the capacity to deal with anyone who contravened the laws, accused el-Rufai of inciting the herders against them, even as he reiterated the resolve of the South that the presidency must come to the region in 2023.\n\nEl-Rufai had while speaking to newsmen on Tuesday after a visit to the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, insisted that the anti-open grazing law being passed by some Southern states was not implementable, but that ranching and not open grazing was the solution to the ongoing farmer/herder\u2019s clashes.\n\nBut, Akeredolu, first in an official statement by his Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said, \u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufai, if he was properly quoted and his views not misrepresented, is struggling hard to export banditry to the South under an expressed opinion that is laced with mischief.\u201d\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIn these days and times, anyone who makes statements such as that allegedly made by the governor belongs to a class of an unenviable ilk masquerading as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no wisdom in condemning/banning open grazing, prohibiting inter border movement of cattle in the North, including Kaduna, with an accompanying disapproval of a law that gives bite to same, in another part of the country.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor el-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially, as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffices in the North.\u201d\n\nThe Ondo governor noted that, \u201csuch comment like that of the Kaduna Governor, if indeed he made that statement, merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise of resentment of a law by affected stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn order words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the South, the most despicable situation in the North, that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome. It\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, further added that, \u201cThe Anti-Grazing Law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay. It shall be zealously guarded and conscionably deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the Law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise, Akeredolu, who wondered why anyone would think the region was playing politics with the issue, warned that the south did not take the wellbeing and the livelihood of its people lightly and would do anything to protect them.\n\n\u201cThere is no politics about the anti-open grazing law. We say people are destroying the livelihood of our own people and we say we are not going to allow it to continue and it is certain.\n\n\u201cAnd if he says it is not a law we cannot enforce, let him wait or let him bring his herders here, they will go back to inform him whether we are able to enforce the laws, he will get to know. There is no need for him to be in a hurry, the people will go back to him to tell him that it is being enforced and we are going to enforce it\u201d.\n\nMore on the issue of capacity, Akeredolu noted that the law was already in operation in Ondo, because those who were infringing on the law were paying for it.\n\nAccording to him, the state has established a process to ensure any herder, who destroyed any farm was made to pay repatriation before the cattle would be released to such a herder, adding that, \u201cas a second time offender, you are going to prison.\u201d\n\nWhile observing that Miyetti Allah and other herders in Ondo State were already cooperating with the government, he lamented that the Kaduna governor and those who speak like him were only inciting herders against the people of the south and therefore warned that anyone, who broke the law in the state would be punished in line with the law.\n\n\u201cI am happy that Miyetti Allah people are willing to imbibe it; they are not waiting to be incited as my brother want to think. Maybe they should flout the law, that is why he is saying it is not implementable or whatever his words are, that is like wanting to incite the people.\n\n\u201cYou are trying to incite the people, who say they are going to oppose this law and we are saying that if you oppose this law, you will face the consequences. The law is there and has been passed by our own House of Assembly and the Houses of Assembly of every state that has passed the law and every state that has passed the law will implement the law to the letter,\u201d he maintained.\n\nThe Ondo governor queried why southern governors should consult with their northern counterparts before passing a law that was in the interest of their own people, adding that the southern governors could not \u201cbeg\u201d northern governors before passing a law that was in the interest of the people.\n\nHe held that the northern governors met regularly and even met with the president after their meeting and the southern governors have never made any fuss about it.\n\nAkeredolu argued that even the northern governors knew that open grazing was not in the best interest of their people but only wanted to continue to oppress them by allowing them to take their cows from one region to another, adding that that their mode of life was anachronistic and not going to hold.\n\nHe commended Katsina State for its decision to embrace ranching, noting that they were ready to support the state and give it necessary patronage, when operational.\n\nAddressing the 2023 presidential election, the chairman of the Southern Governors Forum said, \u201cThe only way we can continue to remain united as a country is that there must be fairness, there must be equity and there must be justice and the only thing that is fair in this country today is that if we have had a northern president for eight years, it must come down to south this time. That is what we are saying, we are not forcing it on people. We are going to go out and campaign about it, this is politics, it is a game of number\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo became president in 1999 because everybody agreed that the president must come from the south and after Obasanjo, everybody also agreed that it should go to the north and Alhaji Umaru Yar\u2019Adua also emerged as president.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it, that is understanding\u201d, he said, adding that the north has no choice but to be fair to the south and support the push for a southern president.\n\nHis position on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which was just returned to the National Assembly for amendment, was that the governors would continue to push for the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which belonged to both the federal g and the state governments, rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which did not represent their interest but that of the federal government.\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Fidelis David in Akure, Alex Enumah in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",
          "summary": "The Ondo State Governor and Chairman, Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Wednesday, took a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Nasir El-Rufai, for criticising the legal approach adopted by the southern governors in handling the open grazing crisis, saying his statement was a ploy to externalise banditry in the country.\nIt\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary.\u201dAkeredolu, further added that, \u201cThe Anti-Grazing Law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay.\nIt shall be zealously guarded and conscionably deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases.\n\u201cThere is no politics about the anti-open grazing law.\nHe held that the northern governors met regularly and even met with the president after their meeting and the southern governors have never made any fuss about it.",

          "text": "Angry scenes broke out at Haiti\u2019s main airport after migrants were deported to the country from the US.\n\nOn Tuesday, migrants at the airport in Port-au-Prince rushed back towards the plane they had arrived on, while others threw shoes at the jet.\n\nLast weekend, the US started flying out migrants from a Texas border town which has seen an influx in recent weeks.\n\nAbout 13,000 would-be immigrants have gathered under a bridge connecting Del Rio in Texas to Ciudad Acu\u00f1a in Mexico.\n\nSeparately reports have emerged of thousands \u2013 mostly Haitians \u2013 stranded near the border between Colombia and Panama.\n\nChaos unfolded at Haiti\u2019s Toussaint Louverture airport as one man attempted to re-board the aircraft. The plane\u2019s crew rushed to close the jet\u2019s doors in time, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nVideo footage taken at the airport shows people scrambling for their personal belongings after their bags were dumped out of the plane.\n\nThere are reports that some migrants were not told they would be returning to Haiti.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were two separate incidents at the airport on Tuesday.\n\nA source told NBC News that the pilots on board one of the flights were assaulted on arrival in Haiti and three US immigration officers were also injured.\n\nIn a separate incident in Texas, a group of Haitians reportedly fought Border Patrol agents and attempted to escape after realising they were being deported.\n\nAt the time, the migrants were being transported on a bus from the town of Brownsville to Del Rio.\n\n\u201cWhen the migrants found out they were going to be sent back to Haiti, they took the bus over and they fled,\u201d Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, said at a news conference late on Tuesday.\n\nThe removal of migrants has been criticised by Partners In Health, an NGO that has been working in the country.\n\n\u201cDuring a challenging and dangerous period for Haiti, it is unthinkably cruel to send men, women and children back to what many of them do not even call \u2018home\u2019 anymore.\u201d\n\nAbout 4,000 people have either been deported or moved to other processing centres, according to DHS.\n\nFrom Thursday, flights could be ramped up to as many as seven a day, according to the Washington Post.\n\nQuoting an unnamed US official, the Associated Press also reported on Tuesday that authorities are also releasing Haitian migrants into the US \u201con a very, very large scale\u201d.\n\nThe official added that many of the migrants have been given notices to appear at immigration offices within 60 days. The official said this approach requires less processing time than having them appear before an immigration court.\n\nThe migrants have been waiting in a makeshift camp in temperatures of 37C (99F).\n\nLocal officials have struggled to provide them with food and adequate sanitation.\n\nMost of those at the camp are Haitians, but there are also Cubans, Peruvians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans present.\n\nMeanwhile the Colombian government has said that around 19,000 migrants \u2013 mainly from Haiti \u2013 are stranded near the border with Panama. Migrants often cross into Panama and proceed on foot as part of a long journey north towards the United States.\n\nHowever, a senior Colombian official said that many migrants are now stranded near the border as a result of an agreement between the two countries restricting the number of migrants crossing the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 into Panama to just 250 people a day.\n\nHe added that many migrants have been risking their lives by trying to cross the gulf illegally at night on substandard boats.\n\nMany Haitians left the country after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and a large number of those in the camp had been living in Brazil or other South American countries and travelled north after being unable to secure jobs or legal status.\n\nThis year has brought further hardship for the impoverished country. In July, Haiti\u2019s president was assassinated \u2013 and in August it suffered another deadly earthquake.",

          "text": "Leader of Afenifere, a Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, on Wednesday, said Nigeria\u2019s north was actually a minority, but which has maintained a majority claim over the rest of ethnic nationalities in Nigeria.\n\nAn apparently flustered Yoruba leader, however, contended that it was the colonial masters, who stage-managed the northern population, thereby prompting their majority claim over time.\n\nAdebanjo, therefore, insisted that the restructuring of the country was inevitable and that Nigeria needed a new constitution for equity, peace and justice to reign, because the current document called constitution was a fraud.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, who further claimed everything was going on well in the country before the military incursion of 1966, went on to describe President Muhammadu Buhari as a pretender and Nigeria\u2019s number one enemy.\n\nFleshing up the restructuring debate, Adebanjo, who spoke in Ibadan, yesterday, at a national seminar organised by The Yoruba Leadership and Peace Initiative (TYLPI), with the theme:\u201dStrategies and Statics for the Actualisation of a Restructured Nigeria\u201d, said Nigeria was going nowhere unless a new constitution was put in place.\n\n\u201cRestructuring is the only way to keep the sovereignty together. I don\u2019t support secession and I don\u2019t oppose it either. President Muhammadu Buhari is a pretender and number one enemy of the country. I have invested in Nigeria more than Buhari, we signed a document with him on restructuring before his emergence in 2015 and yet he never fulfilled it,\u201d he said.\n\nArguing that the present constitution was faulty and compromised by the military and as such, not sustainable, he said, the problem of the country was the current constitution, because it\u2019s not been working for the progress of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEverything was working until military came in 1966, the colonial masters stage-managed the population for the Northern part, and the minority are now claiming to be in majority, this has caused a lot of problem. The constitution is the most fraudulent constitution.\n\n\u201cWhat is the yardstick for creation of local government in this constitution? The issue of allocation is there unresolved. Why would the population of Kano be more than that of Lagos if not for fraud in our population? Many people are beneficiaries of the corrupt system, that is why they can\u2019t talk.\n\nAnother speakers, Dr. Akin Fapohunda, said change was necessary at the federal level and that all the 36 states of the federation should be collapsed and each region allowed to have its own constitution.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s collapse the 36 state structures, because we can\u2019t survived it, the name \u2018executive\u2019 has to be changed so as to reduce the power of the executive,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, contributing virtually, Prof. Godini Darah, said the mood of the discussion was in line with the emancipation of Nigeria, adding that restructuring remained the agenda of Nigerians at this moment, because there could not be Nigeria without it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s come together and restore the sole aim of federal system of government, because it is been compromised as against the idea of the nationalists before independence in 1960. The present constitution has to go and a brand new constitution has to come alive to accommodate the yearnings of Nigerians,\u201d he submitted.\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Usman Bugaje, in his contributions, said Nigerians needed to focus on how to manage diversity, urging them to come together and work in unity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis current Nigeria is not sustainable, only restructuring can make it stand. We need to change the leadership mechanism, or else, we are not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe President of TYLPI, Mr. Olusegun Ahmadu, in his welcome remarks, said the seminar was not to blame any group but dedicated to how to move ahead and restructure Nigeria, stating that the priority of the country at present should be restructuring and not 2023 elections.\n\nSome of the dignitaries at the event included former deputy governor of Ogun State, Senator Gbenga Kaka, Ambassador Yemi Farounbi, Ms. Yemi Adamolekun and Baale of Ekotedo, Ibadan, Elder (Dr.) Taye Ayorinde, among others.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "West Ham gained revenge for Sunday\u2019s Premier League defeat against Manchester United by knocking their hosts out of the Carabao Cup at Old Trafford.\n\nManuel Lanzini\u2019s ninth-minute effort, his first goal in almost 12 months and only his second since May 2019, proved enough to take David Moyes\u2019 men into the last 16.\n\nNot even the second-half introductions of Bruno Fernandes and Mason Greenwood could swing the game the home side\u2019s way in a performance that exposed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s pre-match chat about the strength of his squad as somewhat hollow.\n\nLanzini\u2019s goal was just reward for West Ham\u2019s flying start. Ryan Fredericks eased between Jadon Sancho and Alex Telles before cutting a low cross back to the Argentine, who finished into the bottom corner.\n\nThree times in the final five minutes the visitors should have wrapped up victory, but Andriy Yarmolenko, Mark Noble and Jarrod Bowen all failed to hit the target. In the end though, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt was the first Old Trafford triumph for the Hammers since Carlos Tevez\u2019s matchwinner in 2007 kept them in the Premier League \u2013 and their first in a cup competition since Paolo di Canio scored the only goal in an FA Cup meeting in 2001.\n\nFor Manchester United and Solskjaer it is an early end to their hopes of securing the first available silverware of the season, and ending the wait for a trophy that stretches back to 2017.\n\nDefeat came after Solskjaer picked a completely different side \u2013 all full internationals \u2013 to the one that was on duty at the London Stadium. He now has tough decisions to make about some of his fringe players, who will now have even fewer opportunities to play.\n\nAnthony Martial was a peripheral figure in attack, Juan Mata was replaced by Fernandes in the second-half, while Lingard, who, like Mata has a contract that expires in the summer, failed to have a notable impact.\n\nIn addition, Dean Henderson didn\u2019t do much on his first appearance of the season to suggest he is a threat in goal to David de Gea.\n\nThe doubts over Solskjaer will surface again too after last week\u2019s Champions League defeat at Young Boys.\n\nNot that any of this will bother Moyes and his West Ham team, who kept their hosts at bay in relative comfort. Mata did clip the bar from an acute angle and debutant keeper Alphonse Areola made a good save to deny Greenwood.\n\nManchester United play Aston Villa at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday, 25 September (12:30BST). West Ham visit Leeds on the same day (15:00BST).\n\nWest Ham coach Stuart Pearce: \u201cDelighted with the result. It is a really tough place to come. We started the game very well. Could have won by two goals to make the evening a bit easier.\n\n\u201cWe were disappointed not to get something at the weekend. United are an outstanding team with a lot of talent. We are aspiring to challenge Man Utd.\n\n\u201cCredit to David [Moyes]. This is the first time he has beaten them since he left. He has been around for nearly 1,000 games, seen it all, done it all. He will take it in his stride. Not get washed away.\u201d\n\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \u201cIt was a poor start and then when we decided that we wanted to join the game we played some good football, loads of shots, loads of pressure, very good attitude, but we lacked a bit.\n\n\u201cEvery game is important but you can see by the team selection that we\u2019ve always used this competition when I\u2019ve been here at the club to give minutes for ones who need it, it\u2019s a long, long season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually won this tournament, that hunt will keep going, it\u2019s a trophy I\u2019d like to have. But we\u2019ve made decisions to get the squad up to speed.\u201d\n\nOn Anthony Martial: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to go into individual performances. Anthony was the same as the rest of the team, we played some nice football, we lacked some of that cutting edge and he knows what we want from him. He\u2019ll keep working and get his chances.\u201d",
