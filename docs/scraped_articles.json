          "title": "Soludo, Uba, Ozigbo win in strongholds, Anambra poll continues today",
          "text": "Three top contenders in the yet-to-be concluded Anambra State governorship election, which commenced on Saturday, have won their respective polling units.\n\nThis was prior to the announcement by the Independent National Electoral Commission that voting would continue on Sunday (today).\n\nThe extension was due to the malfunctioning of the newly deployed Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, which disrupted accreditation and voting in some areas, the commission said.\n\nThe top contenders were the candidates of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Chukwuma Soludo; All Progressives Congress, Andy Uba; and Peoples Democratic Party, Valentine Ozigbo.\n\nThe APC candidate, who voted at Saint Peter\u2019s Catholic School, Uga Ward 16, Polling Unit 10 of Aguata Local Government, scored 80, followed by APGA with 10 votes, YPP scored five votes while PDP scored two votes.\n\nThe candidate of the PDP, who voted at polling unit 010 Social Center, Ward 005, of the Aguata Local Government, Area scored 75 votes, followed by APGA with eight votes while the APC scored two.\n\nThe candidate of APGA, who voted at Isuofia Ward 13, Unit 002 in the Aguata LGA, scored 126 votes while PDP scored five and both APC and YPP scored three votes each.\n\nVoter apathy, late arrival of materials, vote-buying mar polls\n\nMeanwhile, the election was marred by voter apathy, vote-buying, late arrival of materials and the malfunction of the BVAS machine.\n\nDespite the efforts by INEC to ensure a hitch-free exercise, there were several complaints from voters in towns like Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi, Isuofia and some other parts of the state.\n\nVoting was expected to start by 8.30am but as of 11am voting was yet to commence in most centres in Awka, the state capital. With over two hours into the voting exercise, the people of Mgbakwu in Awka North were still awaiting voting materials, which later arrived after midday.\n\nParty agents and voters waiting at Central School lamented the absence of materials and electoral officers. The school houses the two polling units in the town.\n\nA party agent, Benneth Aniezeofor, lamented that the development would impact the exercise negatively as people might lose interest.\n\n\u201cLate arrival of materials will disenfranchise many voters and people may run out of patience and leave which is not good for the election,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother resident said, \u201cWe called them and they told us the materials and polling officers were on the way. We also got the information that the vehicle being used to convey the material developed a fault in the way. One can only hope that the materials will arrive. We have to vote.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the spokesperson for INEC in the state, Reginald Onyeukwu, directed one of our correspondents to his superior.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am far away at Aghamelum, please make a report to my HOD in the office, maybe there are some problems.\u201d\n\nDue to low voter turnout at Nkwo Market Square in Akwa Central, party agents were seen going from one house to another and calling family members and friends on the telephone to come out and vote.\n\nOne of the party agents, Joseph Nnake, attributed the apathy to fear, saying low voter turnout could mar the exercise. He also described the election as peaceful.\n\nOne of our correspondents observed vote-buying at the Nkwo Market Square. Voters were paid N2,500. After voting, the interested voters were ushered to a secluded room to collect the money. A police officer was also heard telling his junior colleague to collect their own share of the money from party agents.\n\nAt Ward 19, Unit 8 at the Ezenifite Town Hall, Okpuno in Awka South Local Government Area, voting finally commenced at about 9.35am.\n\nThe Registration Area Officer, Ibrahim Ganiyu, disclosed that they worked overnight at the centre to ensure that ad hoc staff moved to the field early on Saturday. He noted that corps members needed further guidance regarding the process.\n\nReports from other local government areas across the state indicated that voting did not commence at 8.30am. A 63-year-old woman, Madam Theresa, said she would wait till voting started.\n\n\u201cI am a native of Cross River State but my late husband hailed from this town. I came out to vote. I am not afraid of any kind of harassment or intimidation. Even if they shoot me, I will die and go to where my late husband is,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Ward 9, Ezimezi in Amawbia, Awka South Local Government, a mild drama ensued as voters protested the instruction by the presiding officer, Ahmed Abdulahi, who said \u2018No facemask, no voting\u2019.\n\nIrked by the order, a former Anambra State House of Assembly member, Chikodi Aghanya, described the instruction as \u201crubbish\u201d.\n\nA presiding officer however explained that it was INEC\u2019s instruction and they would implement it, while admitting that they were having challenges with the network to operate.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Willie Obiano and his deputy, Dr Nkem Okeke, hailed the process, describing it as transparent.\n\nThe governor, who has cast his ballot at Eri Primary School, Unit 004, Otuocha 1, Aguleri, Anambra East LGA of the state said, \u201cI appeal to Ndi Anambra to come out and vote as the voting exercise would last for only a few hours. I commend the voting process, it was fast and easy. I am optimistic that the entire exercise would be free and fair across the state.\u201d\n\nWhy I displayed my ballot paper \u2013 Deputy gov\n\nThe deputy governor, who had dumped APGA for the APC weeks before the election, displayed his ballot paper to other voters before dropping it in the ballot box.\n\nOkeke, who voted at Ward 3, polling unit 005, Umueze Awozu, Enugwu-Ukwu, said he did so to dispel rumours that he had returned to APGA. He commended INEC for the new technology it deployed for the exercise.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI had to reveal my ballot paper because there have been rumours that I had defected back to APGA, which is not true. You just saw that I voted for my party, the APC,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with the turnout. The process was transparent. Credit should be given to the Federal Government for providing the enabling environment. The presence of the security personnel gave the people courage to come out to vote.\n\n\u201cThis is the easiest voting experience I have ever had; the process is unified. In previous elections, I had issues with fingerprints, but this was different.\u201d\n\nHowever, at Alor Ward 1 in the Idemili South Local Government Area, scores of voters could not vote as of 11.46am as the BVAS machine did not respond.\n\nThe presiding officer, who asked not to be named, said the BVAS could not capture the voters.\n\nThe National Chairman of APGA, Chief Victor Oye, expressed reservations over the exercise, especially the poor performance of the BVAS machine.\n\nOye, while voting at Amawbia ward 3, Polling Unit 003 in Awka South Local Government, said, \u201cWith the massive turnout of voters at the polling unit, I am afraid that many eligible voters might be disenfranchised. It appears INEC is working in partnership with APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who battled with the BVAS for over an hour waited to cast his vote despite the hiccup.\n\nThe minister called on INEC to make arrangements for manual accreditation when the machine fails so the people could exercise their franchise.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been here for over an hour without success. I\u2019m not impressed. The failure rate is between 25 and 30 per cent. This is not encouraging. INEC should not be packing the equipment after each election. They should be testing such machines a week before elections in a mock trial. I won\u2019t leave here until I vote.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the APC candidate, Andy Uba, who spoke at Otiogba Centre, Ugah Ward 1 polling unit 015, 021, 022, stated that he was optimistic that he would win given the defections into the party before the election.\n\nHe added, \u201cI have voted without any problem. The BVAS is working in my polling unit and I am sure INEC is working to fix the problems that have been noticed.\u201d\n\nThe PDP candidate, Mr Valentine Ozigbo, called for an extension of voting hours to ensure that no eligible voter was denied the opportunity to vote.\n\nHe said, \u201cI call on INEC to extend the voting hours to allow eligible voters to cast their ballot since the delay is not their fault but it is due to the malfunctioning BVAS.\u201d\n\nAlso, the candidate of APGA, Charles Soludo, said his party would win the election if the election was free, fair and credible. The BVAS, however, malfunctioned in his polling unit, causing a delay for hours.\n\nSoludo, who voted at 5.10pm after waiting for almost six hours, said he had to remain in the queue for the women and the aged people to vote as soon as the BVAS started working.\n\nAfter casting his vote, he commended INEC for its efforts to ensure a peaceful and smooth process, while thanking the people for being calm and peaceful in spite of the logistics challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cI voted after a long wait and there was no way I would jump the queue. My 90-year-old father was also in the queue, so allowing them to vote before me was the right thing to do. I believe the will of God will prevail no matter the delay.\u201d\n\nMy intention is to become servant leader\u2019\n\nSpeaking with journalists on Saturday after voting, Soludo said his people urged him to contest and that his aim was to win the election with a wide margin and be a servant leader.\n\nHe said, \u201cI always say that I am an incredible optimist. When we were in court after the primaries, I did make a statement that the judiciary will always come through and that went to the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court. They actually came through.\n\n\u201cIt is not just winning, but winning with a wide margin. I\u2019m more interested in the legitimacy of the process, because for me the mandate I seek is people\u2019s mandate to be their servant leader and that is satisfactory to me.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former governor of the state, Mr Peter Obi, also said he was disappointed with the malfunctioning of the BVAS and delay in the commencement of voting.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after casting his vote at his Umudim Akasi ward 2, unit 019 in Agulu Community, Anaocha Local Government Area of the state, Obi stated, \u201cIt took a while for the exercise to start and when it did, the BVAS were not working, which shouldn\u2019t be. I have also been getting calls from across the state.\n\n\u201cFor most communities, the problem is the non-arrival of all voting materials and of course here (Agulu town), there was a delay, which shouldn\u2019t be. I have voted and in this boot there is always voter turnout. My appeal is that no eligible voter should be allowed to go without voting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, counting of votes began in several polling units on Saturday evening, including Unit 002 Ward 01, Ekwulu Village Hall, Umuona and Units 004, 005, 006 and 007. Also at Units 014 and 013 Ward 001 in Community High School, Nanka in Orumba North Local Government, voting was still in progress as of 5pm.\n\nINEC extends voting till Sunday\n\nMeanwhile, INEC extended voting till Sunday in areas where voting could not be concluded on Saturday.\n\nThe state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Nkwachukwu Orji, said at a press briefing at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Awka, the state capital, on Saturday that the poll would open at 8.30am and close at 4pm on Sunday.\n\nHe said the revised closing time would apply to areas where polling units opened after 8.30am.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn line with existing regulations and guidelines of the commission, any intending voter who is in the queue by 4pm shall be allowed to vote. All Polling Units staff must comply with this directive.\n\n\u201cThe time extension arose out of several field reports that voters had problems with accreditation. The commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, worked perfectly in some polling units but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches.\n\n\u201cOur technicians have already built an update for the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected polling unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the commission.\u201d\n\nThe REC promised that no voter would be disenfranchised. He, however, lamented that some ad hoc staff and transporters contracted to move polling materials and personnel failed to show up.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transport challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilised and collected 50 per cent of their sign-on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad hoc staff stranded.\n\n\u201cAlso, some of the trained ad hoc staff backed out at the last moment. The commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the commission.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders, communities and political parties to remain calm and law-abiding. We assure you that the commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d\n\nSecurity agents commended for tight security\n\nOur correspondents observed that in spite of the apprehension over the election, the exercise was peaceful. Voters, party agents, candidates and other stakeholders commended the security agents for a peaceful poll. Security was tight in different parts of the state and at the polling units.\n\nIt was also observed that three policemen were assigned to each polling unit while soldiers and men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps patrolled the major highways and streets.\n\nAlso, INEC headquarters in the state where the final results would be announced was heavily guarded by policemen and soldiers as of the time of filing this report.\n\nA resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the presence of the security personnel helped to curb violence. \u201cIt is good that the many security personnel were brought to the state for this election. There was no problem and no violence was recorded,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of 7.41pm, patrol teams were on the Onitsha/Enugu highway to ensure that the state remained peaceful.",

          "title": "Amended charges against Nnamdi Kanu laughable, ploy to keep him in detention \u2013 Odinkalu",
          "text": "A lawyer and former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, Prof Chidi Odinkalu, speaks with TUNDE AJAJA on the Anambra State governorship election, the insecurity in the South-East and issues around the 2023 elections\n\nThe proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra previously ordered a sit-at-home from Friday because their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, was not released but the group cancelled the order on Thursday, what were your fears about the election?\n\nThere are many elements to your question and I doubt I can do all of them equal justice. I would recast your first sentence somewhat differently. I\u2019d rather say that a threat was communicated in the name of IPOB. IPOB in the context of the Anambra election was very much a franchise used by a motley group of people with divergent goals. There is a partisan IPOB, for instance, rented by some actors in the Anambra election with a design to ensure as much insecurity as was needed to procure an overwhelming security deployment, which they considered conducive to a predetermined outcome. That is quite clear and a lot of the insecurity towards the Anambra election was attributable to this tendency. It is almost certain that senior people in government at the federal level were aware of this. There is a significant element of network crime in this involving the drug cults and gangs of mostly Anambra Central, who are freelancing for the highest bidder. You also have a set of violence-preneurs who are also active in Anambra and whose provenance is traceable to Ebonyi State. The IPOB-Eastern Security Network also exists although increasingly, while there remains some sentimental connection with their underlying message, their command and control structure, if it ever existed, has frayed to the point of being non-existent. So, folks are doing what they wish, it appears. It is, therefore, difficult to say for certain from whom the threat to the Anambra election emanated as such although the suspicion remained strong that the threat could be from sources allied to one of the candidates in the election for election rigging purposes.\n\nThe police deployed over 30,000 policemen and other agencies deployed personnel too, how does that make you feel?\n\nIt is beyond shameful that the government deployed all these assets \u2013 34,587 police officers, including five Assistant Inspectors-General of Police as well as 20,000 or so Civil Defence assets, not to mention soldiers, ostensibly to police elections in what is the second smallest state in Nigeria (Lagos is the smallest) in terms of land mass. You would have thought that if these assets existed, the government should have taken action long before now by deploying them to bring this thing to an end. By choosing to deploy them only for election purposes, the conclusion is inescapable that the Federal Government wanted to use them not to address the violence but to manipulate the outcome of the elections. To follow the installation of a manifestly illegitimate governor in Imo State with another criminally illegitimate governor in Anambra State will guarantee that there can be no end to the crisis in South-East Nigeria. Hopefully, the Federal Government will see sense in that but I have my doubts. The desperation is beyond evident.\n\nWhat could have been done earlier?\n\nAll these troops and assets should have been deployed long before now. It is not as if the Anambra election is some kind of accident or surprise. INEC had given ample notice of the date. Why the police and Federal Government have only seen fit to act like they are only interested in elections and not in the people or in communities must be for them to answer. Don\u2019t forget, the primary responsibility for security under the 1999 constitution belongs to the Federal Government. All the security agencies under that constitution are federal. So, if they care only about elections and not about people or about communities, there is really little I or anyone can say to affect this situation.\n\nDespite the outrage over the killings and violence in the South-East and assurances by the security agencies, the attacks have continued. Why has peace been elusive in that region?\n\nThe South-East is part of Nigeria and peace is very elusive in Nigeria under the current government. Seven years ago, the crisis of violence was mostly confined to one geo-political zone or two. Now, only the South-West is spared something close to generalised violence. So, you have to ask yourself what has gone wrong. The irony is that this is happening under the President whose claim to fame was that as a General, he had ready-made solutions to Nigeria\u2019s security crises. Clearly, Buhari is part of the problem, not part of the solution. So, the crisis in the South-East Nigeria has to be seen in the context of larger trends in Nigeria.\n\nThe other thing is that it also has to be seen in the context of the electoral failures in the region. It is not an accident that the rise in the crisis in the region is connected to the Supreme Court judgement which installed as governor, Hope Uzodimma. What this means is that he has neither the political incentive to do anything about the violence nor the authority to find solutions, even when those are not too far-fetched. So, this crisis has multiple aetiology and trajectories. There is not one theory that really explains it all.\n\nSome leaders in the region have called for a political solution to Kanu\u2019s issue but the Federal Government has even amended the charges, do you subscribe to a political solution?\n\nThe amended charges I have read are mostly laughable and that is notwithstanding the fact that the Terrorism Prevention Act asserts a framework of extra-territorial criminal responsibility. It appears clear to me that the design is to find an artifice to keep Mr Kanu detained for as long as possible. The problem with the so-called leaders in the South-East is that most of them have really not acted in a manner to accrue any political authority to themselves or to create the impression that they desire to be taken seriously. The other problem is that in fact, the regime at the centre thinks the idea of \u2018political leadership\u2019 in the South-East is an oxymoron. You can see that with the President going to inaugurate a gutter in Owerri. Or with the All Progressives Congress which has fewer than 35,000 members in Anambra State claiming to have had a primary in which over 320,000 people \u201cvoted\u201d. To use a contemporary turn of phrase, they are just catching a cruise at the expense of the South-East.\n\nOn the sit-at-home order, the South-East governors have on several occasions asked the people to disregard the order but some of those who dared it were attacked. How come people seem to obey non-state actors and disregard directives of governors? Could it be that the people have lost respect for the governors or it\u2019s the fear of being attacked?\n\nWho says the people are \u2018obeying\u2019 non-state actors? When an armed robber points a gun at you and makes you surrender your purse or money or car or phones to him or her, you are not doing so because you are under an obligation to but you nevertheless feel obliged to because the alternative could be your demise, right? That is not much different with the sit-at-home. People are not going to willingly starve themselves for IPOB, but if they are going to be decapitated by local blood hounds or their businesses burnt because they are trying to go to the market to get something to eat, then they may give up their right to go to the market in order that they may live for another day. About the governors of the South-East and what they say and don\u2019t say, the fact is they don\u2019t even take themselves seriously on this and they know that. They have lost all authority. This is not the place for me to go into how and why.\n\nThe Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum, David Umahi, recently appealed to Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka not to criticise the President as they were making efforts for Kanu\u2019s release. What do you make of that statement and do you see that approach working?\n\nI will not waste my time on the multiple harlotry of Ejike Mbaka or of the political gigolos that importune him all the time. My problem remains how his Bishop in Enugu, Rev. Dr. Callistus Onaga, continues to tolerate this kind of wilful debasement of both the pulpit and of the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church. As for Governor Umahi, I will not dignify that aspect of the question with an acknowledgement.\n\nThe debate has been ongoing over the region that should produce the next president and many people believe it should be the South-East while some say it should be left open. What is your view on that subject?\n\nI wish anyone who wants to be president of this Nigeria well. I am not sure how anyone can hope to succeed as president of this arrangement, irrespective of where they come from. But the politicians are fixated on 2023. Let me ask you: how sure are you that there will be elections in 2023? Look, to conduct just the governorship election in Anambra, which is 0.51 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s landmass and about 2.2 per cent of its population, we are deploying nearly 14 per cent of the police personnel. So, if you have to do elections on the same day in Kaduna, Zamfara, Katsina, Niger, Borno, Benue and Plateau states, will you borrow Gendamerie from Niger Republic and Chad too?\n\nSome support groups have emerged in the South-West, pushing for the candidacy of Bola Tinubu and Yemi Osinbajo, even though they haven\u2019t shown interest. But there\u2019s nothing like that in the South-East. Some are asking; where are the south-eastern candidates or do you think it\u2019s too early?\n\nI don\u2019t know about Osinbajo yet but Bola Tinubu has not hidden the fact that he wants to be anointed the next president of Nigeria. There are also stories about interested people from the South-East or have you not noticed them? Rochas Okorocha has been going around or have you not seen him? Orji Uzor Kalu has also been interested; Anyim Pius Anyim too. I have also heard that Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba (Minister of State for Education) is interested. And I am sure you have heard of Professor Kingsley Moghalu. So, the South-East is not short of interested people too.\n\nDo you have some candidates from the region in mind that you would want to see occupy that seat?\n\nThat is a decision for Nigerians who have the right to vote and for the political parties who have the duty to present candidates on their platforms. Any list I give you now will be of neither candidates nor aspirants. So, of what use will it be? Electoral democracy is not a contest between whom you wish to have. Rather, it is a choice between the options you have in front of you. Remember, in 2000, Americans dearly desired to have Colin Powell on the ballot. He was unwilling to run and the choice ended up being between George Bush and Al Gore.\n\nThere are people who believe that the governance structure must be restructured before the next election otherwise nothing would change regardless of who emerges. That does not look feasible; what do you think?\n\nIs it not a little late in the day for that? I have no doubt that you are right and there are indeed people who would like for some progress to be made on the restructuring agenda before the 2023 election. The reality is also that there may be even more entrenched interests against that, including the President and the ruling party or those who control it. If the APC were interested, they would have acted on the report of their own restructuring committee. The fact that nothing has come out of that report should tell you all you need to know.\n\nThe National Assembly has left political parties with no choice but to conduct direct primaries; some people believe that should be left for parties to decide. What is your view?\n\nIt seems clear that this decision was driven by one thing only: the narrow desire of the members of the National Assembly to protect themselves against what they (may) perceive as the overbearing control of the party machinery at the state levels by the governors. The assumption that direct primaries will preclude the governors from continuing such control or will diminish their control of the parties at the states is really not well-founded. Whether you have direct or indirect primaries, a governor who is determined to end-run a primary in the state or pre-determine its outcome will, except in an anomalous situation like Lagos State, almost end up having his way. So, I am not sure where the National Assembly is hoping to get to with this but they are entitled to try and fire a shot across the bows of the governors. We will see how far it will go.\n\nNigeria is faced with banditry, kidnapping, economic crisis, endless borrowings, corruption and many others; what are your fears or hopes by the time this government leaves in 2023?\n\nAll that you have mentioned here, in my view and assessment, are not exactly the problems of Nigeria; rather, they are examples of the symptoms of our underlying problem, which \u2013 in one word \u2013 is abysmal leadership and leadership replacement processes. As long as our leadership processes are as they are, these symptoms will continue to metastasize until eventually, like terminal cancer, they overwhelm the body (politic).\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nollywood veteran, Ada Ameh, has stated that she got pregnant at 13 years old because her peers introduced her to sex at an early age.\n\nThe actress made this known in a recent interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, on his show, WithChude, where she spoke about her personal life and career.\n\nKnown for her major role in The Johnsons series, the actress revealed that she was influenced by her peers and this led her to getting pregnant at an early age of 13.\n\nWhen asked about the cause of her early pregnancy, she said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my parents. I was influenced by my peers. They introduced me to \u2018early sex\u2019. One thing led to another and I got pregnant.\n\n\u201cI got pregnant in March and I had my baby in December same year. That means I got pregnant when I was 13+.\n\n\u201cThe most beautiful part is that, on my 15th birthday, my baby was barely five months old. I was marched out of the Barracks.\u201d\n\nAmeh stated that during that period, she took to alcoholism because she felt she had gotten her independence already.\n\nDespite her early motherhood, the actress, in October 2020, lost her daughter, Aladi Godgift, who was over 30 years old.\n\nAladi had died after an unsuccessful surgery in Abuja and few weeks ago, the bereaved mother had visited her daughter\u2019s grave site to mark her one year remembrance.\n\n\u201cOne thing that has not been easy for me was the fact that I allowed my daughter to leave for Abuja. The day I made that mistake was the day I left her to leave the house. I\u2019ve lived with that guilt all my life.\u201d Ameh disclosed in the recent interview.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

They warned about the danger of denying him access to good medical care and allowing him to die in captivity in foreign land.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nIgboho had reportedly developed some health challenges, including kidney problem in Cotonou prison, where he is being remanded for alleged immigration offences, when he attempted to travel to Germany through the city\u2019s airport.\n\nSome of the groups that are worried by the development said they were planning consultations on how best to negotiate his freedom. They appealed to the government of Benin Republic to allow him access to medical help in any place of his choice. In a bid to form a united front on the issue, YCE said it would meet with the leader of Afenifere for discussions on possible way to intervene in his case and probably secure his release through diplomatic strategies.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, who regretted that the body has no link with Igboho at the moment, noted that his group was making efforts to link up with Pa Ayo Adebanjo, the Afenifere leader, to try and reach the Nigerian Ambassador to Benin Republic, Gen Tukur Buratai (retd) and see what could be done to get him freed.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, also pleaded with the government of Benin Republic to do all that is humanly possible and as soon as possible to release him to get medical help in a place of his choice.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom what we heard, he is looking in the direction of France or Germany. We plead with the government of Benin Republic to grant him the opportunity to get medical help there. In any case, it is the person that is alive and healthy that can stand trial or any other thing that is required.\u201d\n\nHe also called for the acceleration of the judicial process. \u201cWe have confidence that Benin Republic that normally follows the rule of law, will ensure that justice is done,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce it is established that Sunday Igboho did not contra vene any law and that for sure he is not a criminal, he will be let off the hook.\u201d\n\nThe apex self-determination group in Yorubaland, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) under the leadership of Prof Banji Akintoye, said the group has been working with other organisations to secure freedom for him. But the Communications Secretary of IOO, Maxwell Adeleye, who initially told Saturday Sun that the strategies to get freedom for him were not for discussion on the pages of newspapers, later noted: \u201cIt is not that he is being held in police custody there,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was remanded by an investigative judge. Unlike in Nigeria where the police do investigation, the judges there are also doing investigation because they don\u2019t want the innocent to be punished. Whatever is happening there, it is the hand of the Nigerian government. If anybody tells you it is the government of Benin Republic that is holding Igboho, it is a lie. It is the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob. They are trying to use immigration issue to hold him down.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Led in evidence by state counsel, Mr. Yusuf Sule, the police officer said: \u201cDuring our investigation, another girl (name withheld) came forward and said the defendant assaulted her when she was 12-years-old.\n\n\u201cWe interviewed her and the defendant behind the counter, and he vehemently denied the allegation. The girl said the incident occurred at Agah area of Ikorodu, and we told a representative of the defendant to follow us to the house, and we met the landlord.

While being cross-examined by Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Kareem said that he never visited the crime scene, adding that Adekoya brought the other minor who also accused the defendant of defilement to the police. He said that the statement of the defendant\u2019s former landlord was recorded at the landlord\u2019s residence and not at a police station. He, however, told the court that the statement was taken to his superior, CSP Margaret Ighodalo.\n\nWhen asked to show where his superior countersigned the landlord\u2019s statement as required by law, the witness said the landlord\u2019s statement was not countersigned. The policeman testified that a lawyer was not present when James made his initial statement to the police at the SCID. He added that James was not taken to Ikorodu to counter the other claim of defilement due to security reasons.\n\n\u201cThe defendant was the one who asked his brother to take us to Ikorodu. We did not take him there because of security reasons; his name was all over the news on televisions and radios. He could have been hijacked from us; that is why we told him to nominate someone and he nominated his brother to go with us,\u201d Kareem said.\n\nJames faces a six-count charge bordering on indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.

He voted at 5:10.p.m at Isuofia ward 13 unit 002, Aguata LGA He came to the venue of his polling unit located at Afiyi Square at about 11:30 a.m. and was not able to vote because the Bimodal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) could not capture him. The New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that at about 10:a m, there was delay during accreditation of voters as the BVAS started malfunctioning. At about 2.p.m, only 18 persons of over 700 voters had been accredited and were able to vote. A new BVAS was brought to the polling unit at 4.05 p.m, which was when proper accreditation and voting started. After voting, Soludo commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for making efforts to ensure a peaceful and smooth electoral process. \u201cI told you I\u2019m an optimist which is why I waited for over five hours forty minutes, because, I believe INEC will come through. \u201cYou can also see that in spite of the delay, our people waited patiently and are so determined to cast their votes no matter the time. \u201cThat is to show you that APGA is Anambra and Anambra is APGA. I believe the will of God will prevail no matter the delay. APGA will win. \u201cI look forward to the credibility and legitimacy of the process. I also believe we have the popular mandate of the people and I believe the system will deliver at the end of the day,\u201d he said. Soludo commended the people and his supporters for maintaining calm and peace inspite of the logistics challenges. Meanwhile, counting of votes has commenced at PU 002\n\nWard 01, Ekwulu Village Hall Umuona and PUs 004, 005, 006 and 007 in Primary school Umuona, Aguata LGA. Also at PU 014 and 013\n\nWard 001 in Community High school, Nanka in Orumba North\n\nVoting is still on as at 5pm.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner. Nkwachukwu Orji said that this revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am. In line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, adding that any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. He said all Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive. According to him, \u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem. \u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission. With this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised. \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. \u201cThe Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case bases. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission. \u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d, he stated.\n\n3:43PM\n\nAnambra Guber: INEC Extends Voting by One Hour Voting continues Sunday David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the Anambra governorship election.

          "text": "* State ringed with 34,587 policemen and 20,000 NSCDC agents * INEC promises free, fair, credible election\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nAmid fear and tension, caused by an endless bloodbath, which hindered campaigns of the political parties, the people of Anambra State will this morning vote to elect a new governor.\n\nThough, the outlawed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it is not opposed to the poll and has withdrawn its stay-at-home order, there is still palpable fear across the state, with many afraid that terrorists may attack voters. This is certain to affect turnout of voters.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high, with streets deserted, but the police and other security agencies have assured Anambra State voters of maximum security and want them to come out without fear. Indeed, every nook and cranny of the state is heavily policed.\n\nAs part of measures aimed at protecting the election, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 PM yesterday, 5th November, 2021 to 11:59 PM today, 6th November, 2021.\n\nThe IG noted that the restriction had become necessary following pointers from the Election Security Threats Assessments conducted by the Force, \u201cwhich indicate a high likelihood of infiltration by criminally-minded individuals to Anambra State, before, during and after the polls.\u201d\n\nBaba further noted that the measure would also avail security forces a firm grip of the state, to checkmate the movement of political thugs and touts, and prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs throughout the period and beyond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baba sent out a strong warning thus: \u201cWe have identified some more flashpoints, but we can handle that without problem. We have 85 per cent of personnel and assets on ground. Our helicopters are down and we have gun boats to take care of the marines and we know the Navy will assist in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure that there is enough security on ground. We have sent signals to those who want to make trouble not to test our will. Those who tried last weekend had sad stories to tell, if at all they were able to get to their camps.\u201d\n\nThe IG had earlier ordered the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 police personnel and three police helicopters to Anambra State ahead of the election.\n\nThe IG said the 34,587 personnel included conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), special forces personnel, Explosives Ordinance Unit (EOD), Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), Interpol, Special Protection Unit (SPU), as well as police medical teams expected to be on ground to guarantee a hitch-free election.\n\nHe said three police helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance amongst other operational capabilities.\n\nThe Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi yesterday announced the deployment of 20,000 personnel drawn from Anambra State and neighbouring state commands, to assist the police with security for today\u2019s election.\n\nAudi assured the people that the election will hold peacefully and successfully without rancor or acrimony \u201cas the Corps is working in synergy and collaboration with other sister agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, security agencies, sensitive and non-sensitive election materials, INEC permanent and ad-hoc staff and all other apparatuses deployed to ensure a hitch free election.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, earlier appointed as head of the special police team providing security for today\u2019s election, was also removed yesterday without any reason given. Egbunike hails from Anambra State and oversees the five police commands in the South-east\n\nThe new team leader for today\u2019s election is Assistant Inspector General Zaki Ahmed, until now the second in command to DIG Egbunike.\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakub also assured Anambra people of a credible election and security of lives and property.\n\nYakub, who spoke during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the INEC headquarters in Awka on Tuesday, said: \u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice. We have received assurances from the security agencies and they said they are capable of ensuring security for all. On our part, we assure Anambra people it will be free, fair and credible election.\n\nThe Leading Contenders\n\nThough there are 18 candidates on the ballot, in practical terms, there are only three candidates in the race for Anambra governorship today.\n\nThese are Charles Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA); Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThough, there is no written agreement on the rotation of governorship in Anambra State on Senatorial basis, this has in many previous elections determined the emergence of a governor.\n\nThis year, Anambra South is the most favoured for governorship, and all three most popular candidates \u2013 Valentine Ozigbo, Chukwuma Soludo and Andy Uba \u2013 who represent the three major political parties in the race, picked their candidates from that zone.\n\nIncidentally, all three leading candidates also come from Aguata Local Government Area. While the three candidates will be sharing the votes in the zone, their ability to garner votes from the North and Central zones, will guarantee their victory.\n\nOzigbo hails from Amesi in Aguata LGA. His philanthropic gestures and support for sports gave him popularity in his Southern zone, but he also has the advantage of having the support of most top politicians in the central, which will give him an edge.\n\nAs he battles for votes in the Southern zone with other candidates, he has the support of the Central zone through the former governor Peter Obi, who supports his aspiration. He will also enjoy massive votes from supporters of Senator Uche Ekwunife who is also his campaign coordinator. Ozigbo may however not do so well in the Northern zone, as he would have the incumbent governor to contend with.\n\nUba hails also from the Southern zone, Uga in Aguata LGA. He is a veteran politician and has contested for the position many times, and this has given him a lot of popularity. In the Southern zone, Uba is also very popular, but will be splitting his votes in the zone with Soludo and Ozigbo. However, in the North, Uba who has several lieutenants in the zone, including the chairman of his political party and his campaign coordinator, will likely sway votes in his direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Uba has a minus in the Central zone, as the minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who also has a large following in the Central zone, does not support him as a result of the fall-out of the governorship primary election of the party last June.\n\nSoludo, former Central Bank Governor, may not be popular in his own zone, but what he lacks in popularity, his party, which is widely accepted in the state has. He and his party also have high popularity in the Central zone, just as it is expected that his largest number of votes will come from the Northern zone. This is because of the influence of the incumbent governor, who is giving him his unalloyed support, just as federal and state lawmakers in the zone are also in support of Soludo.\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nAmid fear and tension, caused by an endless bloodbath, which hindered campaigns of the political parties, the people of Anambra State will this morning vote to elect a new governor.\n\nThough, the outlawed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it is not opposed to the poll and has withdrawn its stay-at-home order, there is still palpable fear across the state, with many afraid that terrorists may attack voters.

Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlso, the attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\u201d\n\nAde-Ojo: I Didn\u2019t Sell Collapsed Building\u2019s Land to Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of Elizade Motors and Elizade University, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo has said he did not sell the land of the collapsed building in Ikoyi to Osinbajo.\n\nAde-Ojo, who said this in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, however, added that he owns a property adjacent to the collapsed building and that he is not willing to sell it.\n\nDeath Toll Now 38\n\nThe Lagos State Government yesterday said bodies recovered from the Ikoyi collapsed building were ready for identification and called on families to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) Yaba to identify the corpses of their loved ones.\n\nThe state government said 38 bodies had been recovered so far from the collapsed building as rescue operation entered Day Four yesterday, while family members had submitted 32 names of those still missing.\n\nLagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, while giving an update to the press, said the bodies would be ready for identification from 4pm yesterday.\n\nOmotoso said an autopsy would be carried out on the corpses before releasing them to their families.\n\nHe said recovery work was still ongoing and would continue until the government is able account for everybody inside the building at the time of the collapse and certify that nobody is left behind in the collapsed building.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unbanked adult population, estimated at over 40 million, are expected to have access to financial services with the regulatory approval of mobile money licences for MTN and Airtel, the country\u2019s two biggest telecommunication service providers.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Thursday issued MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa Approval-in-Principle (AIP) for payment service bank (PSB) licence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the first step in the process towards final approval, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as stipulated by the CBN, the move by the industry regulator brings the take-off of mobile money services in Nigeria closer.\n\n\u201cWith this move by CBN, it is more likely that we are going to meet some of the financial inclusion targets,\u201d Ashley Immanuel, CEO of EFInA, the organization that collates Nigeria\u2019s biennial financial inclusion data, said.\n\nThis, according to her, is based on the evidence that has been witnessed in countries that have leveraged the mobile money-led financial inclusion model to onboard the majority of their unbanked population.\n\nLargely driven by mobile technology, Kenya\u2019s financial inclusion expanded from a low base of 26.7 percent a decade ago to 83 percent in 2020. The East African country is one of the world\u2019s leaders in mobile money services. Telecom\u2019s operator Safaricom pioneered its M-Pesa service 12 years ago to cater for Kenyans without access to the formal banking network.\n\nThe success story of mobile money in deepening financial inclusion is also evident in countries like Ghana, Ethiopia and others.\n\nWhile Nigeria went late to the party as the Central Bank only gave an official nod to telecoms and other non-financial companies to offer financial services in 2018, the payment service bank by the regulator would enable players to offer financial services while deepening the country\u2019s financial inclusion rate.\n\nRead also: CBN issues \u2018Approval-in-Principle\u2019 to MTN, Airtel for PSB services\n\nThe permit will allow the companies to among other things; maintain savings accounts and accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, which is covered by the deposit insurance scheme; carry out payments and remittance (including cross-border personal remittance) services through various channels within Nigeria; issue debit and prepaid cards, and operate an electronic purse or wallet.\n\nThe Central Bank gave its first set of licences to three players in August 2020, two years after it received applications.\n\nBefore now, only banks and licensed financial institutions were allowed to provide financial services (bank-led financial inclusion model). Although telecom operators and other fintech companies indicated interest to operate in the market, the CBN policy would not allow them.\n\nThe regulator eventually shifted because of the increasing rate of financially excluded people in Nigeria and the lack of progress in getting banks to provide financial services to people living in areas that lack access.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the apex bank set a target to ensure that 80 percent of the country\u2019s adult population are financially included in the financial cycle by 2020. The CBN had in a circular in July 2018, lamented that Nigeria was not meeting any of the financial inclusion targets agreed and contained in the 2012 Financial Inclusion Strategy.\n\nNigeria failed to meet its National Financial Inclusion Strategy target for 2020 to include 80 percent of its adult population into the financial system. EFInA data showed that only 64.1 percent was financially included by the end of last year.\n\nThis means that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38.1 million of the country\u2019s 106 million (18 years and above) adults, remain completely financially excluded. This is a shortfall by 16 percent points from the desired target of a 20 percent exclusion rate.\n\nThe 2012 strategy by the CBN had also aimed to reach 70 percent of Nigerians with formal financial services by 2020; the actual figure reported by the EFInA\u2019s Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey released last Thursday showed it was 51 percent \u2013 a shortfall by 19 percent points.\n\nFinancial inclusion means that people have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit and insurance. A higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population, as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\nA higher financial exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWe have said that the biggest thing the CBN could do to quickly expand financial access to people who are not in the system at all is to increase mobile money services which in Nigeria will be under the PSB license and to licence entities that are capable at reaching customers at scale,\u201d Immanuel said.\n\nCommenting on the recently issued Approval in Principle, MTN Nigeria said, the decision to issue a final approval is firmly within the regulatory purview of the CBN and it respects their right and judgement in that regard.\n\nWith its presence in 14 countries across Africa, Airtel Africa, a provider of telecommunications and mobile money services said that its subsidiary SMARTCASH Payment Service Bank Limited (\u201cSmartcash\u201d) has been granted approval in principle to operate a payment service bank business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsanya, CEO, Airtel Africa, the telecom company \u201cwill now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the operating licence and commence operations.\u201d\n\nWhy mobile money is a catalyst for financial inclusion growth\n\nThe use of the mobile money-led financial inclusion model has been adopted by many countries that previously suffered high financial exclusion rates because it is one of the easiest ways to include the hard-to-reach unbanked population into the formal financial system.\n\nIn the case of Kenya, Ghana and many other African countries, with the use of mobile phone numbers which are used in place of a bank account, citizens of the countries are allowed to carry out financial transactions like payment, savings, credit, insurance and among others.\n\nThe same is expected to happen in Nigeria through the PSB licence. The innovation will remove some of the barriers to having a basic bank account like documentation in obtaining a Bank Verification Number (BVN), an 11-digit number that is created for bank customers before they are assigned a bank account, proximity to financial services provider and among others.\n\nWith just a phone number, any Nigerian who does not have a bank account will most likely be able to ride on the infrastructure of any of the telco or other service providers to transact through an e-wallet or mobile money account.",

          "title": "A tale of two biggest building collapses in Lagos",
          "text": "In 2008, a 22-storey building came down in rubbles in Lagos State, but no life was lost, no injury or damage to surrounding buildings was recorded. That was the Bank of Industry (BoI) building constructed in 1972 and brought down through controlled demolition.\n\nThirteen years later, November 2021, a 21-storey building under construction collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos, killing more than 36 people (so far) with dozens injured and many others missing.\n\nThe two buildings are, so far, the largest structures to have crumbled in Lagos, but also two distinctly contrasting stories behind them. One was safely brought down when authorities thought it had become a risk while the other represented a failure of authorities to ensure the developer kept to standards and approvals.\n\nEvidence from the Lagos State government shows that the developer of the building located at 20 Gerard Road, Ikoyi, flouted building permits. In a letter issued to Fourscore Height Limited on April 5, 2019, with registration number IV/2019/DO/033/67 and permit number DCB/DO/2442IV on April 9, 2019, the structure was originally approved for 15 floors, not 21.\n\nA year before this, Prowess Engineering Limited, the original contractor for the building, in a letter dated February 20, 2020, notified Fourscore Homes Limited that it was withdrawing its services on the now collapsed building.\n\nRead Also: Collapsed building: Experts\u2019 views\n\nProwess stated in the letter, \u201cWe arrived at this decision due to the fact that we no longer share the same vision with you as our client in terms of how the project is being executed.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the Fourscore Homes building, on September 21, 2008, the administration of Babatunde Fashola, the then governor of Lagos State, supervised the demolition of the 22-storey BoI building.\n\nCollapsed buildings in Lagos\n\nThe skyscraper located on 67/71 Broad Street in Ikoyi before being brought to its feet had endured five fire incidents that eroded its quality and contributed to a partial collapse reported on March 22, 2006.\n\nThe controlled demolition project that gulped N1.5 billion from the state coffers would be remembered for two feats \u2013 the first of its kind in West Africa and the only building that collapsed without any casualty, not even the least damage to surrounding structures.\n\nBroad Street\u2019s tallest building crumbled within 10 seconds without bulldozers or cranes but with around 5,900 explosives planted strategically around the beams of the structure and then detonated through remote devices.\n\nConsequently, the building collapsed on its weight with rumbles and very thick dust that, for more than 10 minutes, covered the surrounding.\n\nBabatunde Fashola, immediately after the exercise, affirmed his government implemented guided demolition as the path of least risk to the residents in the area. He added that though the building had partially collapsed on March 22, 2006, the state government patiently persuaded both the Federal Government and the BoI management to proffer any solution but this proved abortive.\n\nRead also: Body of Osibona, owner of collapsed high-rise building recovered\n\nAs a result, the state had no other option than to resolve to exercise the constitutional powers of the governor under Section 28 of the Land Use Act by acquiring the property along Broad Street, within which the BoI building was located.\n\nHowever, unlike the BoI building demolished with no casualties, the Fourscore Homes 21-storey building that collapsed on November 1, around 3pm has more than 36 persons so far confirmed dead, even as the cause of the collapse is yet to be ascertained.\n\nApproved initially for a 15-storey building, the Fourscore Homes structure was designed as a luxury apartment to be known as 360 Degrees Towers. The collapsed building promised residents the scenic views of the Lagos lagoon, the Atlantic Ocean, neighbouring estates such as Banana Island, Osborne Road, and the Third Mainland Bridge, as well as the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\n\nFor the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute (NBRRI), the high incidence of building collapse in the country could be attributed to poor supervision and the use of inferior materials in the construction of buildings.\n\nIt buttresses the position of David Majekodunmi, the state chairman of the Nigerian Institute of Architects, who earlier decried lack of strict building regulations by the government and regulatory bodies, as reasons for the collapse of the Ikoyi building.\n\nMajekodunmi, speaking with the media recently, faulted the Project Board at the construction site of the building, noting that the numbers on the board showed that the same person was the consultant and the architect.\n\n\u201cIf the regulatory bodies had seen this board and done the needful, maybe we would be able to know who we are accusing or who to hold responsible for this mayhem,\u201d Majekodunni said.\n\nOkunola Olasunkanmi, a building plan research expert, stated that Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub had witnessed about 155 buildings collapse in a space of 16 years.",

This year\u2019s beneficiaries have been chosen from a pool of over 400,000 applications, selected based on their innovative and impactful business ideas. In line with the Foundation\u2019s mission to catalyse entrepreneurship in Africa, the selected beneficiaries will consist of both new start-ups and existing young businesses in varying operational stages across different sectors.\n\nAs part of TEF\u2019s objectives to ensure that African entrepreneurs are well equipped to build investable and profitable businesses, each beneficiary has undergone world-class business management training and mentorship conducted exclusively on TEFConnect, the Foundation\u2019s proprietary digital platform that provides capacity-building support, advisory and market linkages to over 1 million Africans and counting. The platform\u2019s unique training curriculum covered insightful topics such as Starting Your Business, Business Management & Fundamentals, Leadership & Business Growth, Marketing Strategy, Product Design, and Selecting & Building a Team, amongst others.\n\nCommenting ahead of the Selection Announcement event, CEO Tony Elumelu Foundation, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu, said: \u201cThis year, with support from our global partners, we will be scaling our impact and empowering nearly 5000 entrepreneurs. A major priority for us at the Foundation for 2021 remains the economic recovery of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) following the Covid-19 disruption to economic activities. We are very excited to be unveiling the 2021 cohort of the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship programme. I believe the $5,000 we are giving to each entrepreneur will address some pressing demands and reduce the burden brought about by the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYear after year, we are greatly inspired by the tenacity and quality of business ideas that come out of Africa. This only proves that young Africans need organisations like the Tony Elumelu Foundation who are willing to take a chance on them and their ideas\u201d, she concluded.\n\nThrough the US$100million TEF Entrepreneurship Programme which launched in 2015, the Foundation empowers thousands of entrepreneurs annually, who benefit from mentorship, business management training, access to new markets, US$5,000 in non-refundable seed capital, and networking opportunities to promote their businesses to a global audience. Since the programme\u2019s inception, TEF has trained over 1.5 million young Africans and funded over 10,000 entrepreneurs across all 54 African countries.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nPWC in this report examines the place of Africa in the global race to end carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWith an acceleration of the global net-zero journey, there is increasing focus on developing countries and their lack of affordability to meet such net zero targets. A clear contrast is evident when considering Africa; as home to 17% of the global population, producing less than 5% of global annual emissions and accounting for only 3% of global cumulative emissions.\n\nNotwithstanding, the majority of Africa\u2019s 54 countries (35) have made commitments towards net-zero emissions, but at an estimated cost of $2.8 trillion just to transition Africa\u2019s current energy base by 2050, the required investment levels are largely unaffordable to most countries. This clear message has been given at COP-26 in Glasgow, through calls for increased international financial support from developed nations.\n\nThese are some of the key highlights from PwC\u2019s Africa Energy Review 2021 released today.\n\nWith this background we assess Africa\u2019s Energy landscape, what are the trends and patterns across fossil fuels and renewables. This review outlines a double challenge for Africa of energy transition as well as addressing energy poverty, in line with Sustainable Development Goals. What scenarios could play out in Africa\u2019s energy transition and what is the risk of Africa being isolated from global markets and increasingly becoming \u201cstranded\u201d.\n\nPedro Omontuemhen PwC Africa Oil and Gas Industry Leader, says: \u201cThe energy sector in Africa is diverse and characterised by different demands and needs in each country. While the energy journey for each country may be different, an overall perspective is needed on common issues in the bid to reduce the energy deficit on the continent. While the importance of global decarbonisation and a sustainable planet is foremost, the journey to achieve net zero is clearly highlighting the risk of further entrenching economic winners and losers.\n\nAfrica: Energy snapshot\n\nA snapshot of Africa\u2019s fossil fuel inventories shows a downturn in production, consumption, and exports between 2019 \u2013 2020. This is largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on large projects being delayed or cancelled, as well as global investment pressure resulting in the rapid exit of and disinvestment in portfolios.\n\nOil production significantly decreased by 19% to 6.8 mmbbl/d from the prior year. This accounts for 7.8% of global production. Consumption saw a decrease of 14% to 3.5 mmbbl/d from the prior year. Exports saw a drop to 5.7 mmbbl/d. Gas production experienced a slight decline of 5%, which amounted to 231 bcm, compared to the previous year. Gas consumption saw a slight decline of 1.5% relative to the previous year, amounting to 153bcm. Gas exports saw a decline of 6% to 26.1 bcm compared to the previous year.\n\nDespite companies commencing exploration and development projects, planned capital expenditure in 2020\u20132021 fell from $90bn pre-COVID-19 to $60bn.\n\nRenewable energy snapshot\n\nAfrica\u2019s renewable energy sector in contrast shows an uptake in generation, capacity, and forecasts. Renewable energy is on the rise across the continent with an annual growth rate of 21% between 2010 and 2020 and current total renewable capacity of more than 58 GW (of which hydropower contributes 63%).\n\nWind energy generation increased by 14% and solar energy generation increased by 13%, while total renewable energy generation increased by 11% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Solar capacity increased by 13%, wind capacity increased by 11% and hydropower increased by more than 25% in 2020 compared to 2019. Most African countries are also increasing investment in solar and hydropower technologies with projects currently under construction estimated to add 33 GW of renewable energy capacity.\n\nTotal installed renewable energy capacity in Africa has grown by over 24 GW since 2013.\n\nThe continent\u2019s capacity is expected to increase again by the end of 2021 with growth led by solar and wind projects in Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ethiopia. Forecasts to 2050 estimate 27.32 EJ of additional renewable generation is needed within Africa\u2019s energy mix to compensate for declining fossil fuels, a significant increase from current renewable generation of just 1.79 EJ.\n\nThe challenges of a net-zero transition in Africa\n\nTo achieve net zero by 2050, Africa would need to invest an estimated $2.8tn in a clean energy mix and reduce its current annual CO2 emissions of 1.62m kilotons of CO2e.\n\nInvestment in low-carbon energy systems in Africa lags global pace, but despite global climate finance commitments from developed economies aimed at $100bn per annum, the allocation to Africa falls significantly short of what the continent requires to meet global targets. The fiscal constraints being experienced across Africa create a challenge for the continent to move with pace on its net-zero journey. Private partnerships, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and blended finance are becoming increasingly important and will need to be deployed together with strong public sector governance and innovative financing instruments to overcome these challenges.\n\nJames Mackay, PwC Director: Energy Strategy and Infrastructure, says: \u201cEnsuring a sustainable planet is not a cost-benefit assessment, that said: Africa must carefully consider the economic impact of a transition away from fossil fuels and associated revenues in context of the affordable pace of development and growth of the renewable energy sector. More than a third of African nations are very dependent on fossil fuel commodities for state revenue, foreign currency reserves and local economic activity. An unfunded and rapid shutdown of this sector would place significant fiscal strain and hardship on Africa. On the other hand, too slow a transition may see Africa lag global markets and emissions reductions targets. Developed economies must play an active role in Africa to ensure a global win-win outcome\u201d\n\nEconomic benefits and opportunity costs of the energy transition Africa\u2019s proven fossil fuel reserves are estimated at more than $15.2tn based on current market value. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) alone, nearly 50% of export value is derived from fossil fuels with an estimated annual contribution to GDP from Africa\u2019s current oil, coal, and gas production of approximately $156.2bn. The global energy transition is, however, putting this crucial income source for the continent at risk.\n\nTo achieve the 1.5\u00b0C global warming target under the Paris Agreement, studies suggest that a third of current oil reserves, half the current natural gas reserves and nearly 90% of current coal reserves must remain in the ground. Applying this to Africa would leave a potential $6.7tn of fossil fuels stranded on the continent.\n\nThe adoption of renewable energy has the potential to boost employment opportunities on the continent with the creation of new skills and skills capacity. This employment creation is not limited to direct employment and of relevance to Africa is the potential boost in nonenergy jobs through broader economic activity in rural communities where improved energy access through mini-grids and off-grid solutions will impact economic productivity.\n\nOverall, the energy transition in Africa has the potential to result in total renewable energy employment of around 5m jobs by 2030, which is a substantial increase from the estimate of 324,000 currently employed.\n\nFuture structure of the energy sector in Africa\n\nAfrica\u2019s coal and oil energy production are expected to drop by around 96% and 71% respectively by 2050. This will be driven by declining demand for fossil fuels globally with leading international oil and gas companies already refocusing their portfolios to include higher renewables exposure. Renewable energy is expected to see large gains in Africa over the next three decades. By 2050, energy production from solar and wind is expected to increase by as much as 110 times and 40 times respectively. Employment levels in the energy sector will depend greatly on the way the energy transition takes place. If Africa is pressured into rapidly transitioning to renewables and is assisted in this process through renewable energy funding, the transition of workers away from fossil fuel related jobs will be much faster. The potential loss of jobs, however, can be mitigated. It is forecast that jobs can be created rapidly in the renewable energy sector and this suggests that there is the potential for an overall gain in employment from a renewable energy transition.\n\nDriving a measured transition: four potential scenarios\n\nPwC has defined four potential scenarios that could materialise as Africa progresses the energy transition: (i) Assisted but rushed; (ii) Collaborative and measured: (iii) Business as usual; and (iv) Stranded and strangled.\n\nAll these scenarios are dependent on several factors including: the speed of global net zero adoption; foreign funding available to Africa; and the level of Africa\u2019s economic growth, which will include fossil fuel export revenue.\n\nJames Mackay comments: \u201cThere is no doubt that the energy transition in Africa will be a complex journey with no single blueprint to solving Africa\u2019s challenges. \u201cGame Theory\u201d outlines scenarios for decision making under uncertainty and how the outcome of individual participants depends on the actions of all. The global energy transition must prioritise the planet and all nations rather than identifying winners and losers.\n\n\u201cAfrica will have no choice but to adapt to this new world, but to avoid a growing fault line\u2019 between the developed and the developing world, greater focus on equitable policy, markets and investment is clearly required.\u201d\n\nPedro Omontuemhen concludes: \u201cGlobal climate change discussions at the COP26 conference promise to significantly raise these pressures and discussions with the hope that a combination of stronger foreign financial support, equitable policy and market allocations as well as firm commitment and planning from Africa will result in a favourable platform to support a sustainable Africa energy transition.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said all is set for the official auctioning of the 3.5 Gigahertz (3.5 GHz) spectrum for the deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) technology in Nigeria on December 13, 2021.\n\nA statement signed by the commission\u2019s Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, said it is adopting Ascending Clock Auction format, which is software-based, while a mock auction has been slated for December 10, 2021, as a precursor to the actual auction on December 13, 2021.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Information Memorandum (IM) recently presented to the Commission at a stakeholder engagement forum provides information, conditions, obligations, financial implication, timelines and other necessary details on the planned 3.5Ghz spectrum auction.\n\n\u2018\u2018The IM also explains the rollout obligations of the would-be eventual winners of the spectrum licence auction, whose reserved price has been pegged at $197.4 million (N75 billion),\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u2018\u2018The IM also states that only licensees, who make down payment of 10 per cent of the reserved bid price and with 100 per cent regulatory compliance would be allowed to participate in the auction while licensees with outstanding debts that have secured NCC\u2019s approval for a payment plan will be allowed to participate in the auction.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe auction comes with a 10-year spectrum licence and a minimum requirement of an operational Universal Access Service Licence (UASL), but new entrants or licensees without a UASL will be required to obtain a UASL operational license to be qualified for the 5G licence.\n\nThe eventual licensees will have a rollout obligation plan spanning a period of 10 years, beginning from the date of award of the licence. Between the first and second year of the licence, the operators are expected to rollout service in, at least, one state in each geo-political zone.\n\nFrom the third to fifth year, they are obligated to cover all the zones. Between six to 10 years, they should cover all the states in the country, according to guidelines set out in the IM.\n\nSpeaking on the planned roll out, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, said the Ministry has been working closely with the Commission to ensure that necessary spectrum resources needed for the deployment of 5G network in Nigeria to accelerate the nation\u2019s digital economy space is made available.\n\nThe Minister said the 3.5GHz is the most popular spectrum band used globally by regulators and operators for the deployment of 5G technology, and it seems the only band available in Nigeria for immediate use by operators.\n\nOn his part, he Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, listed the various steps diligently taken by the Commission that culminated in present status of the 5G deployment plan.\n\nHe also highlighted the potential benefits from investment in 5G deployment to potential operators and investors in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria has an estimated population of 214 million, with an average growth rate of 2.6% annually. Approximately 76.46 per cent of the population is under the age of 35. In line with these demographic changes, internet penetration grew from 3 per cent in 2004 to 73.82 per cent as at September, 2021, and broadband penetration increased from less than 10 per cent in 2015 to 40.01 per cent in September, 2021.\u201d\n\nWith the increase in mobile usage brought about by Fourth Generation (4G) technology and network performance, he said that 5G technology will leverage on this momentum, bringing substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), among others, called on the government to continue to make the operating environment more conducive for the existing and prospective licensees in the telecom ecosystem, in order to enable Nigeria to fully harness and harvest the derivable benefits of mobile technology in the country.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the closing of polls for Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State to 4pm\n\nThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Nkwachukwu Orji, made this announcement during a press briefing at the state INEC office.\n\nAccording to Orji, the Commission has extended the period for opening and closing the Poll from 8.30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. This applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30 a.m.\n\n\u201cIn line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 p.m. shall be allowed to vote. All Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive,\u201d he said.\n\nINEC ad-hoc staff had arrived several polling units late due to logistics issues. In Awka North, many polling units did not commence voting process until 12 p.m.\n\nStating the reasons for the lateness of INEC ad-hoc staff, Mr Orji said their deployment was \u201cadversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50 per cent of their sign-on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment, and the Commission was doing its best to solve the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices.\n\n\u201cBimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases. It would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the devise software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem,\u201d Mr Orji said.\n\nThe commissioner, according to Premium Times, said in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission.\n\nMr Orji said with the extension of closing time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, no voter will be disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission.\u201d\n\nMr Orji appealed to voters, candidates, communities, and political parties to remain calm and law-abiding, as the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

The construction is overseen by M&E Consultants.\n\nProwess Engineering Limited, the former consultants, withdrew their services on February 20, 2020, stating that they no longer share Osibona\u2019s mission.\n\nOsibona and state officials are accused of conspiring to increase the number of floors from 21 to 15.\n\nGbolahan Oki, the General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), has been suspended by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who has threatened to pursue all those implicated.\n\nOki had strangely announced that the \u201cowner\u201d had been apprehended, which he is required to clarify to investigators.\n\n\u201cThe materials he used for the reinforcement are so terrible. He got approval for 15 floors but built 21. He has been arrested\u201d, he told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nSanwo-Olu has inaugurated an investigation tribunal. He signed an instrument empowering the panel to invite anyone or company. The panel has four weeks to submit its report.\n\nThe Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) are yet to react. Today is Day 6.",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

God-fatherism does not work. Even a father who controls his child, a time will come when he can no longer controls the child particularly when he now has money and power.\u201d\n\nMoniedafe, though an Urhobo by tribe, is a native of Jimeta in Adamawa State, where he was born and bred.\n\nHe is one of the top 12 aspirants from the nothern region who are angling for the party\u2019s top job.\n\nSo far, all known aspirants who have thrown their hats in the ring in the race to take the seat last occupied by former Edo State governor, Adams Oshiomole, are from the northern part of the country, indicating that APC might have ceeded its chairmanship position to the region while its next presidential candidate is expected to emerge from the South.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that most of these contestants are former governors and serving Senators.\n\nSome of the big names who have a indicated interest for the position include former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; a former two-term governor of Borno State and three term-term Senator, Ali Modu Sheriff, a former Nasarawa State governor, Senator Tanko Al-Makura; a serving Niger State lawmaker, Senator Sani Musa, and former Benue State Governor and now Minister for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, George Akume.\n\nOthers include former Governor of Gombe state, who is currently a senator representing Gombe central, Danjuma Goje, former Governor of Borno state, Kashim Shetima, former Governor of Bauchi state, Isa Yuguda, and governor of Nassarawa state, who are also currently a Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nSunny Moniedafe, who threw his hat into the ring for the party\u2019s national chairmanship office in March, 2021 belonged to the ACN bloc and was the Abuja chairman of the party. He was Secretary of ACN in the FCT before the formation of the mega APC.\n\nHowever, unlike some of the aspirants in the APC national chairmanship race who are publicly backed by one or more prominent figures in the party, Mr Moniedafe at the moment has only his campaign promises.",

          "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N) current and former company directors have reached a $237.5 million proposed settlement with shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the board\u2019s safety oversight of the 737 MAX aircraft, documents released on Friday show.\n\nFollowing two fatal 737 MAX crashes in the space of five months in 2018-19 that killed 346 people, Boeing\u2019s best selling plane was grounded for 20 months and returned to service after the company made significant software and training improvements.\n\nThe proposed agreement, which is being filed in Delaware Chancery Court late on Friday and was confirmed by Boeing, will require the election of an additional board director with aviation/aerospace, engineering, or product safety oversight expertise within one year.\n\nNew York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado, the lead plaintiffs, said the settlement if approved will be the largest monetary recovery in a lawsuit filed in the Delaware Courts over allegations that directors failed to protect against the risk of harm.\n\nBoeing\u2019s board \u201cfailed in their fiduciary responsibility to monitor safety and protect the company, its shareholders and its customers from unsafe business practices and admitted illegal conduct,\u201d DiNapoli said. \u201cIt is our hope, moving forward, that the reforms agreed to in this settlement will help safeguard Boeing and the flying public against future tragedy and begin to restore the company\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nThe agreement calls for Boeing\u2019s board to always be required to have at least three directors with safety-related experience, according to the proposal, which must be approved by a judge to become final.\n\nUnder the settlement, Boeing would amend its bylaws to require the separation of the CEO and Board chair positions, create for at least five years an ombudsperson program to provide Boeing employees conducting airplane certification work for the Federal Aviation Administration with a way to raise work-related concerns.\n\nThe settlement would also require Boeing to provide annual public reports on safety related enhancements implemented by the planemaker since the MAX air disasters.\n\nThe financial penalty is to be paid by insurers to Boeing, the documents show, minus up to $29.7 million in legal fees and expenses to the shareholder attorneys.\n\nBoeing\u2019s current and former directors do not admit wrongdoing and assert they were acting in the best interests of Boeing and its stockholders, according to the settlement.\n\nThe Delaware court in September ruled Boeing stockholders could pursue some claims against the board, saying the first 737 MAX crash was a \u201cred flag\u201d about a safety system known as MCAS \u201cthat the board should have heeded but instead ignored.\u201d\n\nThe crashes have cost Boeing some $20 billion. Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.\n\nBoeing confirmed the settlement and said \u201cBoeing has taken significant actions to reinforce and strengthen our commitment to aviation safety\u201d since the crashes.\n\nThe settlement, it added \u201cbuilds on those actions with additional oversight and governance reforms that will further advance safety and quality in the work that we do.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s board includes the recent additions of Retired Lieutenant General Stayce Harris, who has over 10,000 hours experience as a pilot of Boeing aircraft; and David Joyce, who led GE Aviation from 2009 to 2020.",

          "text": "A New York county prosecutor on Friday asked a judge to delay for two months the arraignment of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on a misdemeanor sex offense charge, saying a local sheriff may have botched the case by rushing to file the complaint.\n\nCuomo resigned in August in the middle of his third term as governor after a five-month official inquiry found that he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\nAlbany County Sheriff Craig Apple filed a \u201cforcible touching\u201d charge against Cuomo last month based on one woman\u2019s accusation that Cuomo groped her under her blouse at the Executive Mansion in the New York state capital of Albany.\n\nBut the charge against Cuomo was \u201cpotentially defective,\u201d Albany County District Attorney David Soares wrote in a letter to the judge dated Thursday because it failed to include a sworn statement from the accuser.\n\nSoares asked Albany City Court Judge Holly Trexler to delay Cuomo\u2019s arraignment, which had been scheduled for Nov. 17, for 60 days to give his office more time to review the case and possibly avoid a procedural dismissal. Cuomo\u2019s attorney supported the request, and the judge granted the delay, scheduling Cuomo\u2019s arraignment for Jan. 7, a spokesperson for Soares said.\n\nSoares said in his letter that his office had been investigating Cuomo for months when the sheriff surprised him with a criminal filing.\n\n\u201cWe were in the middle of that investigation when the Sheriff unilaterally and inexplicably filed a complaint in this Court. Unfortunately the filings is this matter are potentially defective in that the police-officer-complainant failed to include a sworn statement by the victim such that the (state) could proceed with a prosecution,\u201d the Soares letter said.\n\nSoares also said his office was still reviewing hundreds of hours of videotaped testimony and volumes of documents produced by the five-month probe that was conducted by independent lawyers under the direction of state Attorney General Tish James.\n\nSheriff Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. In comments to the Albany Times Union, he said his office followed proper procedures.\n\n\u201cThere was sworn testimony included, and we followed the policies and protocols set to interview victims of sex crimes,\u201d Apple said.\n\nApple previously regretted that Soares and others were surprised by his charge, saying his office filed the paperwork for review and intended to meet with prosecutors to determine whether a criminal arrest warrant or a criminal summons would be issued.\n\nThe process, however, moved much more quickly than planned, and the information was leaked to the news media, he said.\n\nApple also rejected Cuomo\u2019s accusations of political motivations, saying his office had conducted a \u201ccomprehensive and methodical\u201d investigation.\n\nCuomo, who has maintained his innocence, said he only resigned in order to avoid putting the state through the turmoil that would follow his efforts to fight the charges.\n\nIf convicted on the misdemeanor charge, he would face a possible sentence of up to a year in jail.",

          "text": "Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied any link with the 21-storey building that collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos on Monday, saying he has no interest whatsoever in the said property.\n\nThe Vice President, in a statement issued on Friday by his Media Assistant, Laolu Akande, noted that all his property had been documented in the asset declaration form \u201cwhich is in the public domain,\u201d and commiserated with the families of those who lost their lives in the incident.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Lagos State Government revealed that 38 bodies had been recovered from the collapsed building, as rescue operation entered Day Four and called on families of the deceased to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba for identification of the corpses.\n\nReports surfaced online linking the Vice-President to the collapsed building\u2019s land, and there were also claims that the said land was sold to Osinbajo by Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, Founder of Elizade Motors.\n\nOsinbajo debunked the reports, and said further that he never intervened with the regulatory authorities in Lagos State to unseal the Ikoyi property at any point.\n\nThe Vice President said he had briefed his lawyers to sue the online medium that linked him to the said property.\n\nOsinbajo added that he has no business or property dealings with the Chairman of Elizade Motors, Chief Michael Ade Ojo and at no time too did he put any call across to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu over the said property.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cVice President Yemi Osinbajo is saddened by the events that occurred in Lagos on Monday, 1st of November 2021, where a high-rise building under construction on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe condoles with the families and relatives of all those who have died, were injured or affected in the collapse. Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlso, the attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\u201d\n\nAde-Ojo: I Didn\u2019t Sell Collapsed Building\u2019s Land to Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of Elizade Motors and Elizade University, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo has said he did not sell the land of the collapsed building in Ikoyi to Osinbajo.\n\nAde-Ojo, who said this in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, however, added that he owns a property adjacent to the collapsed building and that he is not willing to sell it.\n\nDeath Toll Now 38\n\nThe Lagos State Government on Friday said bodies recovered from the Ikoyi collapsed building were ready for identification and called on families to go to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) Yaba to identify the corpses of their loved ones.\n\nThe state government said 38 bodies had been recovered so far from the collapsed building as rescue operation entered Day Four, while family members had submitted 32 names of those still missing.\n\nLagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, while giving an update to the press, said the bodies would be ready for identification from 4pm Friday.\n\nOmotoso said an autopsy would be carried out on the corpses before releasing them to their families.\n\nHe said recovery work was still ongoing and would continue until the government is able account for everybody inside the building at the time of the collapse and certify that nobody is left behind in the collapsed building.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Amid fear and tension, caused by an endless bloodbath, which hindered campaigns of the political parties, the people of Anambra State will on Saturday vote to elect a new governor.\n\nThough, the outlawed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it is not opposed to the poll and has withdrawn its stay-at-home order, there is still palpable fear across the state, with many afraid that terrorists may attack voters. This is certain to affect turnout of voters.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high, with streets deserted, but the police and other security agencies have assured Anambra State voters of maximum security and want them to come out without fear. Indeed, every nook and cranny of the state is heavily policed.\n\nAs part of measures aimed at protecting the election, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 PM yesterday, 5th November, 2021 to 11:59 PM today, 6th November, 2021.\n\nThe IG noted that the restriction had become necessary following pointers from the Election Security Threats Assessments conducted by the Force, \u201cwhich indicate a high likelihood of infiltration by criminally-minded individuals to Anambra State, before, during and after the polls.\u201d\n\nBaba further noted that the measure would also avail security forces a firm grip of the state, to checkmate the movement of political thugs and touts, and prevent the free flow, circulation and use of illicit arms and hard drugs throughout the period and beyond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baba sent out a strong warning thus: \u201cWe have identified some more flashpoints, but we can handle that without problem. We have 85 per cent of personnel and assets on ground. Our helicopters are down and we have gun boats to take care of the marines and we know the Navy will assist in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure that there is enough security on ground. We have sent signals to those who want to make trouble not to test our will. Those who tried last weekend had sad stories to tell, if at all they were able to get to their camps.\u201d\n\nThe IG had earlier ordered the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 police personnel and three police helicopters to Anambra State ahead of the election.\n\nThe IG said the 34,587 personnel included conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), special forces personnel, Explosives Ordinance Unit (EOD), Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), Interpol, Special Protection Unit (SPU), as well as police medical teams expected to be on ground to guarantee a hitch-free election.\n\nHe said three police helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance amongst other operational capabilities.\n\nThe Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi yesterday announced the deployment of 20,000 personnel drawn from Anambra State and neighbouring state commands, to assist the police with security for today\u2019s election.\n\nAudi assured the people that the election will hold peacefully and successfully without rancor or acrimony \u201cas the Corps is working in synergy and collaboration with other sister agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, security agencies, sensitive and non-sensitive election materials, INEC permanent and ad-hoc staff and all other apparatuses deployed to ensure a hitch free election.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, earlier appointed as head of the special police team providing security for today\u2019s election, was also removed yesterday without any reason given. Egbunike hails from Anambra State and oversees the five police commands in the South-east\n\nThe new team leader for today\u2019s election is Assistant Inspector General Zaki Ahmed, until now the second in command to DIG Egbunike.\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakub also assured Anambra people of a credible election and security of lives and property.\n\nYakub, who spoke during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the INEC headquarters in Awka on Tuesday, said: \u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice. We have received assurances from the security agencies and they said they are capable of ensuring security for all. On our part, we assure Anambra people it will be free, fair and credible election.\n\nThe Leading Contenders\n\nThough there are 18 candidates on the ballot, in practical terms, there are only three candidates in the race for Anambra governorship today.\n\nThese are Charles Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA); Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThough, there is no written agreement on the rotation of governorship in Anambra State on Senatorial basis, this has in many previous elections determined the emergence of a governor.\n\nThis year, Anambra South is the most favoured for governorship, and all three most popular candidates \u2013 Valentine Ozigbo, Chukwuma Soludo and Andy Uba \u2013 who represent the three major political parties in the race, picked their candidates from that zone.\n\nIncidentally, all three leading candidates also come from Aguata Local Government Area. While the three candidates will be sharing the votes in the zone, their ability to garner votes from the North and Central zones, will guarantee their victory.\n\nOzigbo hails from Amesi in Aguata LGA. His philanthropic gestures and support for sports gave him popularity in his Southern zone, but he also has the advantage of having the support of most top politicians in the central, which will give him an edge.\n\nAs he battles for votes in the Southern zone with other candidates, he has the support of the Central zone through the former governor Peter Obi, who supports his aspiration. He will also enjoy massive votes from supporters of Senator Uche Ekwunife who is also his campaign coordinator. Ozigbo may however not do so well in the Northern zone, as he would have the incumbent governor to contend with.\n\nUba hails also from the Southern zone, Uga in Aguata LGA. He is a veteran politician and has contested for the position many times, and this has given him a lot of popularity. In the Southern zone, Uba is also very popular, but will be splitting his votes in the zone with Soludo and Ozigbo. However, in the North, Uba who has several lieutenants in the zone, including the chairman of his political party and his campaign coordinator, will likely sway votes in his direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Uba has a minus in the Central zone, as the minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who also has a large following in the Central zone, does not support him as a result of the fall-out of the governorship primary election of the party last June.\n\nSoludo, former Central Bank Governor, may not be popular in his own zone, but what he lacks in popularity, his party, which is widely accepted in the state has. He and his party also have high popularity in the Central zone, just as it is expected that his largest number of votes will come from the Northern zone. This is because of the influence of the incumbent governor, who is giving him his unalloyed support, just as federal and state lawmakers in the zone are also in support of Soludo.\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke",
