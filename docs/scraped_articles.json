          "text": "Some senators have dismissed the calls by individuals and groups for a brand new constitution, saying the amending of the 1999 Constitution will address grievances and challenges in the country.\n\nThe senators, who spoke to our correspondent in Abuja, believed that it was not practicable to have a brand new constitution.\n\nSenators Gabriel Suswam , Gersom Bassey, Frank Ibezim and Opeyemi Bamidele expressed the opinions in separate interviews with our correspondent.\n\nSuswan insisted that it was possible to carry out the required amendments on the 1999 Constitution that would address the nation\u2019s challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you look at developed economies, constitutional amendment is a continuous process. Nobody calls for a brand new constitution anywhere.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a change of attitude of Nigerians. If you produce a brand new constitution, will that change Nigerians?\n\n\u201cWhat I think is that we should be talking about change attitude and the sincerity in the implementation and interpretation of the constitution.\u201d\n\nBassey also said there was nothing difficult in amending the 1999 Constitution because the document was subject to amendments.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that constitutions in most part of the world are living documents which means that they are continuously being amended as they are used.\n\n\u201cI think the idea of sitting for a new constitution is not workable since we have a constitution that allows itself to evolve.\n\n\u201cThe amendments allow us to achieve the type of constitution that we desired. The argument of a brand new constitution is debatable.\u201d\n\nIbezim also disagreed with the idea of a new constitution, saying, \u201cConstitution amendment enables people to review the state of the nation\u2019s law.\n\n\u201cNigerians know their challenges. The ongoing constitution review is timely so as to tackle the challenges facing Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBamidele who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal matters said, \u201cNigerians who are calling for a brand new constitution are doing so based on their own assumption of what ought to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a totally new constitution because the law does not grant us the power to do that. What Section 9 of the constitution grants us the power to do is amendment to the existing provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, part of the amendment that can be made is an amendment to Section 9 which has specified the mode of altering our constitution.\n\n\u201cIf it can be amended to provide for referendum by Nigerians that would make it possible for us to go for a new constitution, it is okay; but we have considered so many bills and we have concluded the national public hearing and we would start the process of compilation.\n\n\u201cHowever, no single bill from any quarter in Nigeria has proposed an amendment to Section 9 of the constitution.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Senator representing Osun East Senatorial District, Francis Fadahunsi, argued that the amendments being made to the 1999 constitution would not sufficiently address the challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nFrancis Fadahunsi, said, \u201cWhat the country need is a brand new constitution.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the current regime had enough time to organise a constitutional conference whose report could be adopted by the National Assembly as the constitution.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen former President Goodluck Jonathan was in power, he organised a constitution conference but its report was not implemented by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe that trying to amend the 1999 Constitution is like a tailor trying to mend a rag.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 constitution is not a product of Nigerians; so we need a constitution that is produced by Nigerians and which they could claim ownership of.\n\n\u201cThe powers in the centre are too much. We should produce a brand new constitution. We should meet as a region.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, who has been accused of allegedly defiling a minor, was arraigned before the Lagos State Magistrate Court in Yaba on Wednesday.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported how a closed-circuit television installed in the victim\u2019s home captured Omiyinka allegedly molesting the victim while her foster mother was not at home.\n\nIt was learnt that the victim\u2019s mother, who had been suspecting that her daughter was being sexually abused, installed the CCTV to uncover the perpetrator.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that the victim\u2019s mother monitored the situation in her home on her phone and to her dismay, she saw Omiyinka allegedly conducting himself in a suspicious manner around her daughter.\n\nOmiyinka was, however, arrested by the police and granted bail on May 17 in a special court session arranged during the strike by the Judiciary Workers Union of Nigeria but he was unable to meet the conditions of the bail granted to him and he had remained in custody.\n\nUpon the resumption of the judiciary workers, the actor was arraigned before Magistrate Peter Nwaka on charges bordering on rape, sexual assault and abuse of a minor.\n\nHe was charged with indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault \u2013 which contravenes Sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nFollowing his plea, the prosecutor, S.A Adebesin, informed the court that information had been filed before the high court in the state.\n\nResponding Omiyinka\u2019s lawyer, Kayode Olabiran, made a fresh application for bail on behalf of his client.\n\nMagistrate Nwaka, however, refused the fresh bail application on the ground that the Lagos State Ministry of Justice had filed charges before a high court and ordered that the defendant be given medical attention as he was looking pale when he appeared before the court.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a situation of lack of jurisdiction because once a case is filed at an upper court, the lower court, being the magistrate in this case, ceases to have jurisdiction over the same matter. I have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP.\n\n\u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given. The defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court.\u201d\n\nMagistrate Nwaka adjourned the matter till July 13 for mention.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026Burst kidnap gangs\n\nBy Ibrahim Wuyo\n\nThe Kaduna State Police Command has unravelled how two men in Zaria ,Kaduna State connived to kill their friend in order to avoid refunding the sum of N385,000 they owed the deceased.\n\n\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer( PPRO), ASP Mohammad Jalige,said at at a press briefing that on the 5th June, 2021 at about 0900hrs the Command received a complaint from one Bashir of Zaria town that on the 4th June, 2021 at about 1000hrs his biological son, one Idris Bashir left home and never returned up to the time he was filing the report and was suspecting his sons friend ,one Mannir Salihu as responsible for his son\u2019s disappearance.\n\nUpon accepting the formal complaint, the Police investigated with the view to unraveling the pre and post disappearance of the victim which led the Command to immediately launch a manhunt for the suspect.\n\nAfter apprehending the suspect, he disclosed that himself and one Aliyu Yahaya \u2018m\u2019 of No.94 Anguwan Magajiya, Zaria City lured the victim to an uncompleted building where they killed him and dumped the body in an abandoned well.\n\nThey decided to commit the dastardly act of ending the victim\u2019s life in a gruesome manner, in order to avoid refunding the sum of Three Hundred and Eighty Five Thousand Naira (N385,000.00) they owed the deceased.\n\nThe suspect led the Police to the scene where the body of late Idris Bashir was exhumed and taken to Hajiya Gambo Sawaba General Hospital for examination and later released to the family for burial according to Islamic rites.\n\nIn another case of criminal conspiracy and kidnapping, the PPRO narrated that\n\non the 14th May, 2021 at about 1430hrs ,one Mallam Ismail of Tudun Jukun, Zaria reported to the Command through Divisional Police Officer Tudun Wada, Zaria that on the same date he suspected that his son one Mohammed Ismail \u2018m\u2019 4 years old of the same address was kidnapped to an unknown destination, hence his report to the Police authorities for appropriate action.\n\nOn the strength of the complaint, Police immediately launched an investigation into the said allegation.\n\n\n\nHe said on the 16th May, 2021 the abductors sent a letter containing a GSM number to the Father directing him to call and pay the sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,500,000.00) if he wants to secure the freedom of his son. However, after much persuasion the abductors agreed to accept the sum of Fifty Thousand Naira (N50,000.00) through the account of a POS agent at Zuba Abuja. The victim was released on the 19th May, 2021 at about 1700hrs through a commercial motorcyclist in Gwargwaje area of Zaria Metropolis.\n\n\u201cIn a turn of events, the victim kept calling the name of one Sani Sa\u2019adu who is their neighbor which arose the suspicion that he might know a thing about the incident. Police immediately intervened and invited the said Sani Sa\u2019adu for questioning. Lo and behold, it was discovered that he is the principal suspect who masterminded the kidnapping incident and went ahead to mention his criminal accomplices as One Abdullahi Usman and Usman Idris all of the same address. They were both arrested and currently undergoing investigation after which they will all be charged to court as soon as possible,\u201d he said\n\n\n\nHe said on 22nd March, 2021 at about 2100hrs one Alh. Hamza Suleiman m of No. 1 Bello Street Hayin Naiya Kaduna reported at Rafin Guza Division that his son one Affan Hamza m 6yrs was kidnapped by unknown person. \u201cDuring investigation One Jabir Salisu m was arrested in connection to the crime who led to the arrest of one Abba Ibrahim and Muhammed Shaibu all m of Hayin Naiya, Kaduna. The suspects have confessed to the crime and the victim was rescued unhurt by the operative of Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the State CID. Meanwhile, the suspects will soon be charged to court for prosecution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that the command is reiterating its call to the general public to always be wary of their environment to avoid falling victims of trust from neighbours and so called friends,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Patricia Obozuwa: I look for employers that allow diversity",
          "text": "By Morenike Taire\n\nBefore joining the Coca Cola Company\u2019s Africa Leadership Team very recently, Patricia Obozuwa served as the Chief Communications & Public Affairs Officer for GE Africa, a position she held since 2012.\n\nSince then, she has become an icon for blue chip corporate Nigeria, having served in senior management positions with several internationals.\n\nShe shares her journey with BL, with lessons learnt.\n\nYou have worked with four multinationals companies, was it part of your career plan or it just happened that way?\n\nI was just focused on a particular job at hand but I have been fortunate to come across opportunities to work with these reputable companies and organisations, such as British Council, Procter and Gamble, General Electric and now Coca Cola. FMCGs industries in Nigeria.\n\nREAD ALSO: Coca Cola Foundation provides computer accessories to 30 schools\n\nWhat are the positive and negative impacts the multinationals have brought to the local FMCGs?\n\nImpact could be negative and it could be positive depending on the company. Some of the positive impacts are in the areas of technology transfer because when a new technology comes into a country, people are trained on using that technology so that is expertise being built; and it is then transferred to the country.\n\nAnother would be on employment because there is always an impact on local employment. They have to employ local talents.\n\nThere is usually the initial capital outlay no matter what the company is coming to do, sometimes it\u2019s capital investment like a factory, sometimes, it isn\u2019t. But those investments are important for a country and have a snowballing impact positively on whatever industry the multinational comes into. For example, when a multinational employs, they may work with them for their lifetime, they may also move into a local company. Some companies have programmes around leadership development programmes, technical development programmes and those programmes usually yield results for the company in terms of hiring people but usually there will be many more people trained. Other thing is on income tax as well, when the multinational comes in, they make profits and pay tax.\n\nFor the negatives, it depends on the company. Different companies operate in different areas. If it is food, they can have different impacts on farmers. One thing that FMCG would do to stay on the positive are; ensuring that there is local and technology transfer, ensuring that they are developing a local goods supply chain which won\u2019t happen overnight but over time. A company should have a plan in place that sees that the local industries are contributing to whatever products they make.\n\nSo you want to see multinational FMCGs that even while they may have some expatriates, you want to see increasingly that local talents fill in those leadership positions that they have strong succession plan. Sometimes because of certain area of expertise, you might not have someone locally. What you want to see over a period of time is that multinationals are also exporting talents from the country to other sides because they have developed these talents of expertise to the point that they are able to contribute significantly in another country and in another business outside of the country. So it is a give and take and the more the multinational expertise do these things, the more positive impacts they will have and the less of these things that they do, the more negative impact they will have.\n\nGeneral Electric and Coca Cola are very different industries. How do you hope to acclimatize in your new role? Is there a nexus between the two?\n\nBefore GE, I worked for Procter and Gamble which is a consumer product company. So, its experience across both types of companies. The important thing about the kind of roles that I play, is in understanding a company, understanding how a company intends to grow and being able to communicate about that company, being able to engage each with stakeholders, including government and others on behalf of the company. We need just to bring strategic thinking into the internal environment. It is being able to work through strong sustainability plans for the company in Coca Cola\u2019s case. Regardless of whatever type of company an executive finds themselves, you can at least at this level, once you have the right technical ability; it has to be more of leadership, and about transferring those skills into the new company with strong understanding of the new industry.\n\nCoca Cola is a century old organization. Are you not intimidated by the prospect of sustaining the brand?\n\nAbsolutely not. Coca cola has an absolutely strong reputation all over the world. It is easier to deliver on reputational work or stakeholders\u2019 engagement work. When you are working in a company that already has a strong track record, and a great reputation, I should also point out that coming from GE which is almost two centuries old, and 120+ years in Africa, it\u2019s not knew for me to work for such a company. The same thing for Procter and Gamble. These are companies that are over a century old and are companies with strong reputations.\n\nMy hope and aim is to build on that reputation and translate that commitment to Africa to show it from the lens of an African. I\u2019m not intimidated at all.\n\nCorporate organisations seem to make it a point to be engaging women on their boards these days. Is there a business case for that?\n\nThere is a lot of research around the fact that companies that have women in their boards are more profitable. There are marketing reports somewhere that have shown that. Having diversity of thoughts in general has been proven to have a correlation with profitability of a company. Before people saw it to be a nice thing to have because you want to show your commitment to diversity but today, it\u2019s actually a commitment to success and profitability of a company when you have more women on your board.\n\nHow do you hope to influence the government policy in a way to benefit Coca Cola and the industry generally?\n\nI don\u2019t believe my role is focused on influencing government policy like a lobbyist, but Coca Cola is committed to this continent and to Nigeria as a country and we should look towards a way of working with the government that is mutually beneficial to the country and to the company.\n\nWhat is your job description?\n\nIt is heading a team of professionals that are the leading media relations and government affairs; and creating sustainability initiatives and corporate social responsibilities. It\u2019s all communications with employees, stakeholders engagement and managing this for Coca Cola across Africa. So it\u2019s leading a team of leaders across 54 countries on the continent to deliver results.\n\nOf all the corporate organisations you have worked for, which one has the best Gender Policy as far as you are concerned?\n\nI have been fortunate and I want to say it\u2019s by design because it\u2019s one of the things I look for while joining a company. I have been fortunate to work for companies that have very strong policy that accommodate and promote diversity. And this is in GE, Procter and Gamble and I see the same in Coca Cola providing an equal platform for both genders to thrive and that doesn\u2019t mean having uniform policy. All these organisations I have mentioned have very strong programmes encouraging women to thrive in leadership positions.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Anthony Agbo, a former Senator representing Ebonyi North Senatorial District has lambasted an unnamed pastor over the comments he made against late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua.\n\nRecall that two days after T.B Joshua was confirmed dead, a Lagos based Pastor, Chris Okotie had shared a cryptic post on his Facebook page in which he referenced to a certain \u201dwizard of Endor\u201d who assumed the title of \u201dEmmanuel\u201d.\n\nOkotie said the wizard who assumed the title of Emmanuel had been consumed by divine indignation.\n\nHis post came days after a clergyman, T.B Joshua, who was known for using the name \u201dEmmanuel\u201d in his church, died.\n\nBut the Senator wrote in an article he made available to DAILY POST that a \u201cfew days ago, I read of a Lagos- based top Pastor who mocked TB Joshua and jubilated at his exit.\u201d\n\nInsecurity: Major crisis will hit Nigeria \u2013 Rev. Chris Okotie warns\n\nAccording to the article, \u201cThis Pastor had always attacked and condemned TB Joshua when he was alive.\n\nHide quoted text\n\n\u201cReading about his inglorious descent to mocking the dead Saint even at his death, I immediately remembered the story of Theagenes of Thasos, a celebrated ancient Greek Olympian who was the overall champion of Olympic games in 480 B.C.\n\n\u201cWhen Theagenes died, the Greek city of Thasos erected a giant statue of him at the public square. But a jealous citizen of Thasos who hated Theagenes so much for his heroism and great success will visit the statue every night to flog, beat and spit at it, yet he was not satisfied.\n\n\u201cThen one night he took instruments and began to dig the statue so as to bring it down. But the statue fell down upon him and killed him.\n\n\u201cThe people of Thasos still erected a bigger statue for Theagenes. I leave this little story for that beloved Lagos Pastor. Envy, jealousy, hatred are great evils, moreover when associated with those who are supposed to be teachers of the word. But for TB Joshua, \u2018the son of man must go as it is written of him\u2019.\n\n\u201cEcclesiastical history has shown that often, the greatest appears momentarily to light up the dark corners of human horizon, and then shortly disappears in a cloud of glory.\n\n\u201cOur master and Saviour, Jesus Christ stated in the scripture that among all those born of women, that John the Baptist was the greatest. But we recall that John the Baptist was beheaded by King Herod just in his 20\u2019s. In today\u2019s christianity, the \u201cHigh Priests\u201d would have declared that John the Baptist was not of God, having died such death.\u201d\n\nThe former federal lawmaker noted that what he described as \u2018spiritual pride\u2019 has been the bane of Christianity in Nigeria where every top minister sees himself as bigger and better than the others.\n\nSome other top pastors in the country, such as Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG; Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church; Pastor Paul Enenche of the Dunamis Church and many others have refused to speak about T.B Joshua\u2019s death, neither did they send condolences to the Synagogue Church Of All Nations or his family.\n\nPastor Adeboye\u2019s 43-year-old son, Pastor Dare, died a few months before T.B Joshua and was mourned at the Synagogue, where a minute silence was observed for him. T.B Joshua had also sent a condolence message to RCCG and the family of Adeboye.\n\n\u2018The wizard called Emmanuel has been consumed\u2019 \u2013 Rev Chris Okotie",

          "text": "The police in Bauchi State have arrested a housewife with her 18-year-old daughter as well as husband, for maltreating her step children, including a three-year-old, subjecting them to severe beatings and starvation.\n\nThe trio were arrested by police operatives from the Township Police Station in Bauchi where a case of maltreatment was reported against them by a non-governmental organisation, Syndicate In Supporting Women And Children Initiative (SISWACHI).\n\nExplaining what led to the arrest of the three persons, a rights activist and Executive Director, SISWACHI, Hajiya Binta Adamu Ibrahim, told journalists in Bauchi on Wednesday evening that following a viral video of the malnourished children on the social media, she was directed by the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Abuja to intervene in the matter in order to ensure justice is done for the victims.\n\nAccording to Hajiya Ibrahim, SISWACHI had been dealing with sexual and gender-based violence cases, lamenting, however, that the case of torturing of the minors, a five-year-old and a three-year-old respectively, was an odd case.\n\nShe informed that following the directive from its headquarters, the NGO reported the police at the Township Police Station, adding that the police promptly effected the three persons.\n\nShe added that considering the severity of the torture on the children, SISWACHI took the children, who she said were a living skeletons as of the time of her organisation\u2019s intervention, to Tashan Babiye Hospital in the Bauchi State capital for them to be given proper medical treatment.\n\nNarrating her children\u2019s ordeals in the hands of their step mother and sister, their mother, Habiba Sani Khalid, lamented that they were subjected to starvation and torture.\n\nKhalid, who had been divorced from the father of the children, told journalists at Tashan Babiye Hospital where she was staying with the children, that her youngest child, Sumaiya Yakubu, a three-year-old, almost died of torture by her stepmother.\n\nShe alleged that her children were not only starved but also beaten unnecessarily by their stepmother, alleging further that her daughter was tortured with fire by her 18-year-old elder half sister in the presence of her mother.\n\nAccording to Khalid, \u201cThe elder half sister used to lit fire wood and put it on the girl\u2019s back when she was asked to clean herself after defecation.\n\n\u201cShe did that in the presence of her mother and father. That has continued until the matter was later exposed,\u201d she alleged.\n\nShe added that the stepmother often beat both Sumaiya and her five-year-old elder brother, Abubakar Yakubu, indiscriminately even as she denied them food as and when due.\n\nThe traumatised mother informed that her former husband later called her to come and take the children away and eventually sent the three-year-old daughter to her when she refused to go and take them from their father\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cTheir father later called me on phone and asked me to come and pick my children. He said if I didn\u2019t carry them, he wouldn\u2019t bother about their plights because he has other children he cares for.\n\n\u201cI declined to go and pick the children, so he eventually sent the girl to me. I realized that she was staggering. She asked me for food. I also saw wounds of beatings and burns on her body. She was asked what happened to her and she narrated her ordeals,\u201d Khalid said.\n\nShe informed that it was one of her relatives who also saw the girl\u2019s condition that recorded and posted her pictures on social media, adding that, \u201cit went viral and attracted the attention of human rights organizations who came to Bauchi to bring us succour.\u201d\n\nThe doctor treating the children at the hospital, Dr Mark A. Garba, disclosed that as of the time they were brought to the hospital, they were malnourished and highly dehydrated.\n\nHe, however, said the children\u2019s that conditions had highly improved now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Police Command\u2019s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ahmed Mohammed Wakili, confirmed the incident and arrest of the stepmother, her daughter and husband to journalists.\n\nHe added that the culprits have been charged to court.",

          "text": "\u2022Commission creates 56,872 centres\n\n\u2022Fixes dates for Ekiti, Osun governorship elections\n\nBy Chuks Okocha\n\nAfter 25 years and ahead of preparations for the 2023 general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday announced the creation of additional 56,873 polling units, with Lagos and Kano States topping the distribution list with 4,861 and 3,148 centres respectively.\n\nWith the creation of the polling units, Nigeria now has 176,846 polling units.\n\nThe new polling units were created after over 25 years of the creation of the old polling units of 119,973.\n\nINEC also removed 749 polling units from inappropriate facilities, nine of them from shrines, while others were from religious houses and palaces.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who gave the figures at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in Abuja, said the history of creating and expanding polling units in Nigeria had been long and complex.\n\nHe said the adequacy and accessibility in terms of number and location across the country were some of the challenges that had to be addressed in the interest of credible elections.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cBefore 2010, the commission operated on a round figure of approximately 120,000 polling units. However, a census undertaken by the commission before the 2011 general election arrived at the precise figure of 119,973 polling units. The commission also made efforts to relocate many polling units from inappropriate places such as private residences and properties, palaces of traditional rulers and places of worship to public buildings accessible to voters, polling agents, observers and the media during elections.\u201d\n\nHe stated that following unsuccessful attempts to create additional polling units despite pressure from increased number of registered voters, the commission established voting points and voting point settlements nationwide as a pragmatic response to necessity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe voting points were tied to the existing polling units and voting point settlements. The number of registered voters in a polling unit and the voting point settlements in the FCT was used to determine their voting points, based on the upper and lower thresholds of 500 and 750 voters respectively.\n\n\u201cThese were also, the limits used for the 2019 general election. The number of new polling units in a state is the number of voting points aggregated from those polling units having voting points.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it was discovered that one polling unit in Lagos State had been wrongly categorised as a voting point and the error was corrected. With this adjustment, the actual number of approved polling units came to 119,974.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the commission arrived at the exact figure of 56,563 voting points in addition to 309 voting point settlements in the FCT, making a total of 56,872 voting points.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, after wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders and voting point settlements by officials, the 56,872 voting points and voting point settlements were converted and added to the existing 119,974 polling units.\n\n\u201cThe commission is glad to report that 25 years since the current polling units were created in 1996, the hard nut is finally and successfully cracked after several unsuccessful attempts. Nigeria now has 176,846 full-fledged polling units,\u201d Yakubu stated.\n\nAccording to him after consultation with stakeholders, the commission has successfully removed 749 polling units from inappropriate locations to appropriate public facilities or open spaces in line with INEC policy to guarantee unencumbered access to polling units for all voters.\n\nOf this figure, 232 removed from private units were relocated for various reasons which include distance, difficult terrain, congestion, communal conflict, new settlements and general insecurity.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yakubu said that in view of the advanced preparations already made by the commission, four pending bye-elections in Kaduna, Jigawa and Plateau States would be the last to be conducted using a combination of polling units and voting points.\n\n\u201cTwo of these elections in Sabon Gari State Constituency in Kaduna State and Gwaram Federal Constituency in Jigawa State are holding this weekend while the commission awaits the formal declaration of vacancies by the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives in respect of Lere Federal Constituency of Kaduna State, and Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State.\n\n\u201cFor subsequent elections, beginning from the Anambra State governorship election holding on 6th November 2021, there will be no voting points anymore in Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman said the new approved polling units for each state of the federation and FCT would be presented to the public in 37 volumes at this meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of the Independent National Electoral Commission, I would like to express our profound appreciation to the leadership of political parties, civil society organisations, the media, security agencies, religious leaders, socio-cultural associations, the labour unions, professional bodies, persons with disabilities, women and youth groups, students\u2019 unions, the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the state governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC) and the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe also acknowledge the invaluable support of the development partners for facilitating some of the stakeholder engagements and the publication of advocacy documents.\u201d\n\nYakubu said that the commission was preparing to conduct the remaining off-season end of tenure elections ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said activities listed in the timetable for the Anambra State governorship election were being implemented, along with the those of the FCT Area Council election holding on 12th February 2022.\n\nHe stated that the Ekiti and Osun State governorship elections would hold next year.\n\nIn keeping with its policy of announcing the dates of elections in advance to enable early and effective preparations by all concerned, Yakubu said the commission had approved that the Ekiti State governorship election would hold on Saturday, June 18, 2022, while the Osun State governorship election would hold on July 16, 2022.\n\nState by State Distribution of New Polling Units\n\nMeanwhile, Lagos State and Kano State got the highest allocation from the 56, 872 new polling units, with 4,861, and 3,148 units, respectively.\n\nAccording to the breakdown obtained by THISDAY, the 19 northern and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have a total of 31,196 polling units while the 17 Southern states have 25,676 polling units.\n\nAbia State got 1,387 polling units; Adamawa 1,495; Akwa Ibom, 1,374; Anambra 1,112; Bauchi, 1,349; Bayelsa, 440; Benue, 1,414; Borno, 1,138; Cross River, 998; Delta, 2,239; Ebonyi, 1,161; Edo, 1,892; Ekiti, 250; Enugu, 1,187; FCT 2,260; Gombe, 770; and Imo 1,235.\n\nOthers are Jigawa, 995; Kaduna, 2,910; Kano, 3,148; Katsina, 1,750; Kebbi, 1,345; Kogi, 960; Kwara, 1,015; Lagos, 4,861; Nasarawa,1,761; Niger, 1,765; Ogun, 1,832; Ondo, 924; Osun, 753; Oyo,1,607; Plateau, 2,358; Rivers, 2,424; Sokoto, 956; Taraba, 1,685; Yobe,1,109; and Zamfara,1,013 units.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nHuman rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Femi Falana, and the Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, have opposed President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to reclaim land for open grazing, saying there is no national law on open grazing.\n\nFielding questions on The Morning Show, a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, the silk said contrary to the impression the president has created, Nigeria has no national law on cattle grazing routes.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Buhari\u2019s response to a question in an exclusive interview with ARISE NEWS Channel last Thursday that he had directed Malami to get an old gazette on grazing routes and reclaim the land for open grazing by herdsmen.\n\nHe stated that the president may have been misinformed by those who told him that Nigeria had a gazetted law on cattle routes and called for sanction against those who had misinformed the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cBefore 1964, Nigeria had an indigenous political class that was ruling the affairs of the regions during the colonial master\u2019s reign in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat was when the grazing reserve law was enacted by the political class that was in charge of the northern region and the law was enacted for only the northern region, which was not applicable to all other regions of the country. The law was not enacted in the Western region, Mid-western region and the Eastern region.\n\n\u201cAt that time, regions like the Western region had ranches in Epe in the current Lagos State, Akunu in the current Ondo State, and Oke-Aku in the current Ekiti State. These ranches were established in 1956, under Obafemi Awolowo\u2019s regime. We also had ranches in the Eastern region at that time. We had Obudu Ranch in the Eastern region that was established in 1951.\n\n\u201cSo Nigeria does not have a uniform policy in animal husbandry and open grazing. So, the call by President Muhammadu Buhari, telling Malami to make available the country\u2019s national gazette on cattle routes for open grazing is misinformation on the part of those who informed the president that Nigeria had a gazette on cattle routes for open grazing because Nigeria had none, except for the northern region that was not applicable to all other regions of the country that were autonomous at that time.\u201d\n\nFalana, however, said the grazing reserves of the First Republic had been seized by Ashanti farmers, adding that it would take a serious legal battle that would last for years, to reclaim them.\n\nHe said the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum had earlier spoken against open grazing and had also announced that they had adopted the agriculture transformation plan of the federal government.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government must be consistent with its policies, especially as it concerns open grazing since governance is a continuous process.\n\nGiving reasons why Nigeria needs policy consistency, Falana said the government seemed not to be consistent with its policies, adding that inconsistency will lead to people\u2019s mistrust.\n\nHe said in 2016, the then Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbe, had announced that the federal government had acquired 55,000 acres of land in 11 states for cattle rearing.\n\nHe said the same government later came up with the idea of a cattle colony also called Ruga.\n\nHe stated that Ruga was opposed by most state governors who felt it was a means through which the federal government will acquire their land.\n\nFalana added that in 2018, the federal government and states came up with the National Livestock Transformation Plan that will cost N100 billion and the states will provide N20 billion while the federal government will provide N80 billion.\n\nHe stated that in 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had announced plans for Nigeria to ban the importation of milk because the country was spending between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion yearly on milk importation.\n\nEmefiele had added that the federal government would make loans available for cattle ranching.\n\n\u201cIn February this year, the entire 36 states governors had at a meeting agreed to discontinue open grazing and embrace ranching in line with the federal government\u2019s policy. Later this year, the 17 South-south governors banned open grazing in Southern parts of the country. Most Northern governors have begun ranching in their various states and Kano State has invited all those cattle rearers who were displaced to come to Kano for ranching of their cattle and this is where we are today,\u201d he added.\n\nFalana called on Malami to brief Buhari on the level of development with regards to cattle ranching in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president may mean well for the country but without cognisance of the level we are with cattle ranching and the Land Use Act that empowers every state governor the right to control land in their states.\n\n\u201cThe president of Nigeria does not have control over land outside of the Federal Capital Territory, according to the Land Use Act of Nigeria. So the federal government cannot acquire land from any state under the Land Use Act. So with the Land Use Act, the law on open grazing is no longer applicable.\u201d\n\nHe urged Buhari to withdraw his position on open grazing and align with the current Land Use Act.\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s comment condemning the ban on open grazing by the 17 Southern governors, and for defending the rights of cows to move around in any part of the country, Falana quoted Section 41 of the 1999 Constitution, as saying that the freedom of movement can only be applicable to human beings and not cattle or any kind of animals.\n\n\u201cThe law is very clear that humans have freedom of movement and not animals,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn security in states, Falana said Buhari erred for saying that governors have control over security in their states, since the constitution vested power in the president to declare a state of emergency, without vesting such power in governors.\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s position that Twitter and its Founder, Mr. Jack Dorsey, are vicariously liable for losses incurred during the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria, the learned silk said: \u201cI heard the statement and I must confess that I was taken aback because the Honorable Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, is a senior lawyer; so, I expect that he knows the implication of his statement.\n\nAgain, this is why the government must ensure that it is consistent in its policies, otherwise, this country becomes a laughing stock in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the same issue, the senator representing Osun Central Senatorial district, Basiru, yesterday said Buhari has not received well-informed and proper legal advice from Malami and his legal team.\n\n\u201cLooking through all relevant laws pertaining to cattle grazing, there is in fact nothing to gazette because whether in the North or South there is no law of grazing routes,\u201d the senator said.\n\nHe argued that neither in the North nor in the South has a law creating grazing routes either as state law or federal law, saying it is unfortunate that the president has been misadvised on the matter.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Grazing Reserves Laws in some states created from the former Northern Region of Nigeria are deemed to be state laws by Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), having been adopted from the Grazing Reserve Law of Northern Region of Nigeria (NN Law of 1965).\n\n\u201cFor examples, CAP 3 Laws of Kwara State; CAP 56 Laws of Bauchi State; and CAP 55 Laws of Katsina State.\n\nIn the case of these laws, it was expressly stated that they are adopted from Northern Nigeria Laws of 1965. There is no provision for grazing routes as it is being claimed,\u201d the senator explained.\n\nBasiru added that there has never been federal legislation on Grazing Reserves and/or Grazing Routes in Nigeria, adding that the Northern Region Laws are not applicable everywhere in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, by the present constitutional provisions, such a law cannot be within the competence of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe Grazing Reserves Laws are only applicable and enforceable in those states created from the former Northern Regions that chose to adopt same as part of their revised laws like Kwara, Bauchi and Katsina States. It appears that Jigawa State omitted the Grazing Reserves Law as part of its law in the more recent compilation of its laws,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFurther and be that as it may, none of the extant Grazing Reserves Laws made mention of grazing routes not to talk of making provisions thereof.\n\n\u201cIt was only in section 37(1) (a) of the law that the law mentioned \u2018trade route\u2019 in criminalising open grazing outside the grazing reserves areas.\n\n\u201cHowever, what is \u2018trade route\u2019 was not defined in the law and there is no other reference to the term \u2018trade route\u2019 in the law. The purport of Grazing Reserve Law, contrary to the impression being sought to be created, is to create grazing reserve areas to be created with necessary legal requirements and criminalise grazing outside the grazing areas. Under those laws animals are only allowed to graze in the grazing reserve or \u2018trade route,\u201d the senator explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Commission creates 56,872 centres\n\n\u2022Fixes dates for Ekiti, Osun governorship elections\n\nBy Chuks Okocha\n\nAfter 25 years and ahead of preparations for the 2023 general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday announced the creation of additional 56,873 polling units, with Lagos and Kano States topping the distribution list with 4,861 and 3,148 centres respectively.\n\nWith the creation of the polling units, Nigeria now has 176,846 polling units.\n\nThe new polling units were created after over 25 years of the creation of the old polling units of 119,973.\n\nINEC also removed 749 polling units from inappropriate facilities, nine of them from shrines, while others were from religious houses and palaces.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who gave the figures at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in Abuja, said the history of creating and expanding polling units in Nigeria had been long and complex.\n\nHe said the adequacy and accessibility in terms of number and location across the country were some of the challenges that had to be addressed in the interest of credible elections.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cBefore 2010, the commission operated on a round figure of approximately 120,000 polling units. However, a census undertaken by the commission before the 2011 general election arrived at the precise figure of 119,973 polling units. The commission also made efforts to relocate many polling units from inappropriate places such as private residences and properties, palaces of traditional rulers and places of worship to public buildings accessible to voters, polling agents, observers and the media during elections.\u201d\n\nHe stated that following unsuccessful attempts to create additional polling units despite pressure from increased number of registered voters, the commission established voting points and voting point settlements nationwide as a pragmatic response to necessity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe voting points were tied to the existing polling units and voting point settlements. The number of registered voters in a polling unit and the voting point settlements in the FCT was used to determine their voting points, based on the upper and lower thresholds of 500 and 750 voters respectively.\n\n\u201cThese were also, the limits used for the 2019 general election. The number of new polling units in a state is the number of voting points aggregated from those polling units having voting points.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it was discovered that one polling unit in Lagos State had been wrongly categorised as a voting point and the error was corrected. With this adjustment, the actual number of approved polling units came to 119,974.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the commission arrived at the exact figure of 56,563 voting points in addition to 309 voting point settlements in the FCT, making a total of 56,872 voting points.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, after wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders and voting point settlements by officials, the 56,872 voting points and voting point settlements were converted and added to the existing 119,974 polling units.\n\n\u201cThe commission is glad to report that 25 years since the current polling units were created in 1996, the hard nut is finally and successfully cracked after several unsuccessful attempts. Nigeria now has 176,846 full-fledged polling units,\u201d Yakubu stated.\n\nAccording to him after consultation with stakeholders, the commission has successfully removed 749 polling units from inappropriate locations to appropriate public facilities or open spaces in line with INEC policy to guarantee unencumbered access to polling units for all voters.\n\nOf this figure, 232 removed from private units were relocated for various reasons which include distance, difficult terrain, congestion, communal conflict, new settlements and general insecurity.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yakubu said that in view of the advanced preparations already made by the commission, four pending bye-elections in Kaduna, Jigawa and Plateau States would be the last to be conducted using a combination of polling units and voting points.\n\n\u201cTwo of these elections in Sabon Gari State Constituency in Kaduna State and Gwaram Federal Constituency in Jigawa State are holding this weekend while the commission awaits the formal declaration of vacancies by the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives in respect of Lere Federal Constituency of Kaduna State, and Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State.\n\n\u201cFor subsequent elections, beginning from the Anambra State governorship election holding on 6th November 2021, there will be no voting points anymore in Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman said the new approved polling units for each state of the federation and FCT would be presented to the public in 37 volumes at this meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of the Independent National Electoral Commission, I would like to express our profound appreciation to the leadership of political parties, civil society organisations, the media, security agencies, religious leaders, socio-cultural associations, the labour unions, professional bodies, persons with disabilities, women and youth groups, students\u2019 unions, the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the state governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC) and the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe also acknowledge the invaluable support of the development partners for facilitating some of the stakeholder engagements and the publication of advocacy documents.\u201d\n\nYakubu said that the commission was preparing to conduct the remaining off-season end of tenure elections ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said activities listed in the timetable for the Anambra State governorship election were being implemented, along with the those of the FCT Area Council election holding on 12th February 2022.\n\nHe stated that the Ekiti and Osun State governorship elections would hold next year.\n\nIn keeping with its policy of announcing the dates of elections in advance to enable early and effective preparations by all concerned, Yakubu said the commission had approved that the Ekiti State governorship election would hold on Saturday, June 18, 2022, while the Osun State governorship election would hold on July 16, 2022.\n\nState by State Distribution of New Polling Units\n\nMeanwhile, Lagos State and Kano State got the highest allocation from the 56, 872 new polling units, with 4,861, and 3,148 units, respectively.\n\nAccording to the breakdown obtained by THISDAY, the 19 northern and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have a total of 31,196 polling units while the 17 Southern states have 25,676 polling units.\n\nAbia State got 1,387 polling units; Adamawa 1,495; Akwa Ibom, 1,374; Anambra 1,112; Bauchi, 1,349; Bayelsa, 440; Benue, 1,414; Borno, 1,138; Cross River, 998; Delta, 2,239; Ebonyi, 1,161; Edo, 1,892; Ekiti, 250; Enugu, 1,187; FCT 2,260; Gombe, 770; and Imo 1,235.\n\nOthers are Jigawa, 995; Kaduna, 2,910; Kano, 3,148; Katsina, 1,750; Kebbi, 1,345; Kogi, 960; Kwara, 1,015; Lagos, 4,861; Nasarawa,1,761; Niger, 1,765; Ogun, 1,832; Ondo, 924; Osun, 753; Oyo,1,607; Plateau, 2,358; Rivers, 2,424; Sokoto, 956; Taraba, 1,685; Yobe,1,109; and Zamfara,1,013 units.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In-house vs. Agency: What tech startups can learn from the biggest question of the corporate world",
          "text": "From the birth of management consulting in the aftermath of the 1921 Depression to the golden era of advertising in the 1950s, followed by strategy, IT, and accounting consultants in the three decades that followed, large corporation leaders have, for a long time, had options on human resource, with external expertise sometimes a competition to internal competence, and other times a complement.\n\nHowever, the trend of firm/agency adoption has been trailed by criticism as consultants debate, among other things, the decision to\u2026 yes, hire consultants, leaving business leaders with a lot to think about, and sometimes the confusion on which approach to take. While there are similarities in their dilemmas, tech startup founders do not have as much luxury and are by nature, designed to achieve more with less. Perhaps the most difficult of the questions is on what is truly more, or less.\n\nStartup founders understandably tend towards the desire to have as much as possible done internally, especially on verticals like brand, marketing, advertising, and media (or one could just say \u2018marketing\u2019, for ease). This desire is inspired by, among other factors, 1. the need to be agile; 2. the need to be understood; 3. the need to be lean; 4. the need to invest in internal competence; and 5. the need for control.\n\nThere are a few downsides to keep in mind, however, but we will (subsequently) discuss alternative approaches to maximizing the pros.\n\nRestricted flow of ideas due to the monotony of challenge in-house. Rigidity of human resources as you cannot just \u201cchange hands to switch things up\u201d, like you could ask an agency to switch people working on your account (or even change the agency altogether). Difficulty in attracting top talent as a good percentage are more likely to choose being in the company of their like-minds for exchange of ideas, among other things.\n\nWhile a lot of these ring true, the motivations for internal teams remain strong, and rightly so. Below are a few things startup founders surely want to ponder upon as they work towards success with these objectives while avoiding some of the issues raised above.\n\nOn operations \u2014 the need to be agile\n\nStartups are rightly concerned about the speed and flexibility they can expect from agencies.\n\nBeyond clearly discussing these expectations, which is very important, it helps to design a system where the agency professionals devoted to the project are clearly known and there is a communication system that is transparent, with collaborators from both sides being able to interact through platforms that make new teams out of the collaboration. Think about it like a Joint Task Force.\n\nOn quality \u2014 the need to be understood\n\nFounders trust their ability to get their teams on board with the bigger picture, values and more. They are sometimes unsure how to extend this for external teams.\n\nFirst, it is important to remember that while the internal perspective may be the most important, it is only one side to the full view. Agencies are able to see the company from without and escape the trappings of confirmation biases, and a lot more.\n\nAs a collaboration appears like a better balance of perspectives, it helps to ensure that there are key internal stakeholders on the project team, with at least one of them being well versed in the field of expertise being outsourced. They help to provide that \u201cfrom-within\u201d influence. Usually, there is a co-founder or top executive deeply involved in these conversations, as they set the direction for major decisions.\n\nOn budget \u2014 the need to be lean\n\nNeedless to state that startups need to cut costs and spend wisely to extend their runways.\n\nMany startups decide to go fully in-house as a way to cut costs but the only way that results in lower costs is if they set up teams with people with far lower capacities compared to agency professionals. It\u2019s either that or they are breaking the bank to match up, as they make up for the tendency of this top talent to prefer teams of their peers, if pay was the same. There is hardly any true saving of costs in this regard, especially when you also add how agencies are able to spread their payroll across multiple talents and hence be relatively cheaper in fees for the client.\n\nA better way to save money is to combine an internal team of a few seasoned experts, some mid-level talents or interns with an experienced team (external) that is tasked with setting the foundation and helping to fully onboard (or sometimes train) the internal team. A continuous but cheaper path to continuity may involve the internal team doing the day-to-day work while using the guardianship of the external agency.\n\nOn talent \u2014 the need to invest in internal competence\n\nStartups are thinking about breaking that bank as a long-term investment in talent development.\n\nWhile this is a great approach when there is the budget for it, perhaps the best gift for an in-house team is to not close them up, no matter high the quality of talent within, but to rather open them up to the exchange of ideas achievable with collaboration from external teams who readily come with more diversity in experience.\n\nOn trust \u2014 the need for control (or commitment)\n\nMany startup founders have experienced being treated as \u201cone of many clients\u201d, feeling helpless and being unable to control timeline and delivery issues.\n\nThe thought here is to simply shop carefully, and speak to other startup founders who have worked with agencies to determine which ones have the best systems that ensure that despite the inability to directly manage the condition of things, as external engagements go, they can be trusted to commit to the goals of the clients. This calls for a thorough process of choosing the agencies and firms to work with, but just like hiring staff, the work is always hard but worth it.\n\nOne more place to look at is in the contracts and SLAs, ensuring that expectations are clearly stated as well as clear systems to check and review the progress of work week in week out, or bi-monthly.\n\nThere are hardly any definite answers, surely not from the traditional \u201ccorporate world\u201d. What we have to work with are lessons and talking points to thoroughly think around as each team finds its own fit.\n\nIn the end, it may be more about how best to combine both than which side to commit to.\n\nVictor Fatanmi is the Managing Partner at FourthCanvas, a brand strategy and design agency focused on African tech ecosystems.\n\nShare this article",

Armed with our new motto \u2013 \u201cEveryone is invited\u201d \u2013 we are telling more pan-African stories and covering more regions on the continent.\n\nAnd speaking of stories, we decided to give them a better, cooler home. The result of that decision is what you are currently reading this on \u2013 our new website!\n\nWe\u2019ve been at this since 2013 and so far we\u2019ve been able to bring much-needed attention to Africa\u2019s nascent startup and innovation scene. From local startup news to funding rounds across Africa, we\u2019ve kept you up to date with all of it but most importantly, we\u2019ve shown you how technology is positively impacting Africa.\n\nSo what\u2019s new?\n\nSometimes you just want to rest your eyes from the brightness of your devices and a lot of platforms give you that option these days. Well, the new TC website is not left out. You can flip the switch and enjoy your favourite stories in dark mode or light mode!\n\nDark mode\n\nLight Mode\n\nTC Insights:\n\nOur TechCabal Insights team is always bringing you the best in actionable data and research. Now, you can easily find reports created by the TC Insights team under the reports section of our new website!\n\nTC Reports\n\nWe\u2019ve also included a page that houses all our video content. In the past, you could only watch videos on our Youtube page. Now you can watch TC Live or Building From Ground Up episodes directly on our new website.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, our flagships are now super easy to find:\n\nAbout the flagships\n\nFrom telling human angle stories of how Africans use technologies to reporting big tech and exploring everyday trends as seen on social media, our stories are grouped into a diverse range of interests and consistently shared in different categories.\n\nMy Life In Tech\n\nWhat does it mean to have a career in tech? How does one go from working a job to founding a company? Is the proverbial tech bro/sis a monolith? Every Wednesday, Edwin shares the stories of Africans making great strides in the world of tech and explores their journeys, learnings and aspirations in My Life In Tech.\n\nThe Next Wave\n\nNew use cases, new technologies, new policies. Alex would say that The Next Wave is Africa\u2019s torchlight uncovering answers to all the \u201cwhat next\u201d questions we have after one year of business disruption due to COVID-19. Businesses have found new ways to offer never-before-seen products. Regulators are more alert than ever too. Keep track of all that changes on The Next Wave.\n\nCentre Stage\n\nCentre Stage spotlights the people who are working behind-the-scenes in Africa\u2019s tech and business ecosystem. This column focuses on the bright minds building great products and services away from the public eye.

Everyone should read Ask an Investor to get to know the different investors on the African continent and how they make decisions, says Daniel.\n\nThe Backend\n\n\u201cWhat goes into the design and final outcome of an African tech product? What assumptions do tech companies make about user behaviour?\u201d Alex asks. The BackEnd looks into these and other questions about how products are built in Africa, giving an inside view into the \u201ccontrol rooms\u201d at tech companies.\n\nThe TC Daily Newsletter\n\nWe publish the TC Daily newsletter, the most comprehensive roundup of technology around Africa.

          "text": "Mazi Mobility, a mobility-as-a-service (Maas) startup founded by Jesse Forrester, recently launched its flagship electric motorcycle fleet in Nairobi, Kenya. Mazi Mobility is backed by global Venture Builder, Satgana.\n\nMazi uses motorcycles, locally known as \u2018bodas\u2019, to accelerate the transition to efficient, affordable and clean transport in the city. The startup also introduced battery swapping stations that provide on-demand energy, reducing transportation costs by 50%. The MK3 offers a choice between a single and dual battery, capable of up to 70km and 140km of range, respectively. Mazi is taking a multi-stakeholder approach to drive the e-mobility sector forward. They are working with boda operators, technical institutions and manufacturers to ensure the successful implementation of their service.\n\n\u201cMazi is not just an EV company, we are advocates for a sustainable mass mobility change,\u201d says Jesse Forrester, Co-Founder and CEO at Mazi Mobility.\n\n\u201cAt Mazi, we believe that Africans should be able to move efficiently, and affordably across cities at less than the price of personal vehicle ownership while reducing CO2 emissions. What industry is better to see this change than the boda one? Mazi is taking a long approach to mobility, we don\u2019t want to just have the same status quo but with electric vehicles. At Mazi we move people, data and things. Twende Kazi na Mazi!\u201d\n\nSupporting Mazi on their journey is Satgana, a global Venture Builder on a mission to launch and fund responsible startups aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSatgana backs purpose-driven entrepreneurs who at the core of their business model want to address the social and environmental pillars of the SDGs. They become hands-on partners, supporting their startups with strategy, technology, investor readiness, and impact management.\n\nAs an e-mobility startup, Mazi Mobility fulfils one or more of the UN\u2019s SDGs including SDG#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG#11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG#13 (Climate Action).\n\nIn a conversation with Konstantin Behr, Venture Builder at Satgana, he shared with TechCabal what he looks out for in prospective founders:\n\n\u201cFrom the get-go, we analyse how impact-driven a founder is\u2013 that helps us determine if we\u2019re a right fit for them and vice versa.\n\nI am very passionate about the African continent and having been working in the ecosystem for the last 3 years, I have seen amazing growth in startups and increasing interest from foreign investors. Mazi Mobility is our first venture in Africa.\u201d\n\nWhile most Venture Builders hire founders to execute their ideas and strategic plans for a product or business, Satgana\u2019s approach is unique and colors outside the box.\n\nSatgana aims to build and invest into startups alongside purpose-driven entrepreneurs, wherever they are, by using innovation-led and market-based approaches to solve the greatest social and environmental challenges of our time. And alongside Mazi, they hope to write a new chapter in the history of e-mobility in Africa.\n\nFounder and CEO at Satgana, Romain Diaz, elaborated on the launch of their first portfolio venture saying,\n\n\u201cThe urgent need to decarbonise our economies places transportation at the cusp of a fundamental shift towards electric solutions and mobility in Africa is ripe for disruption. As such, Satgana is beyond excited to be involved in the launch of Mazi and truly believes in the founding team\u2019s ability to make it happen. Since day-1, we have been impressed by Jesse\u2019s vision and execution capability. As a Venture Builder, we are humbled to be able to support Mazi in its mission to make urban transportation sustainable while empowering low-income drivers.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Yesterday, June 16, 2021, Spotify \u2014 Swedish audio streaming and media service provider \u2014 launched Spotify Greenroom.\n\nIn March 2021, the platform announced that it was acquiring Betty Labs, the company behind the sports-focused app, Locker Room, to help accelerate its entry into the live audio market.\n\nSince it acquired the app, Spotify said that they\u2019ve been working on expanding its capabilities to enable creators and users to connect more deeply and meaningfully.\n\nGreenroom is a mobile app that allows Spotify users to join or host live audio rooms once they log in. Also, users and creators have an option to convert those conversations into podcasts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new mobile app is a rework of the Locker Room app. Current users of the app will see their app updated to Greenroom\u2019s branding, look and feel.\n\nIn the long term, Spotify plans to leverage its technology on Greenroom to connect users to content they might be interested in.\n\nIt could also recommend podcasts and music based on previous content you\u2019ve consumed on the app.\n\nApart from recording sessions as podcasts, Greenroom has features similar to other live audio platforms like Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces, and Facebook Live Audio Rooms.\n\nIn March 2021, Twitter announced that Twitter Spaces would be coming to the public. And with its launch in April, it became the first live audio platform with an Android version.\n\nCompared to Twitter\u2019s immediate Android availability, Clubhouse \u2014 launched in March 2020 \u2014 was exclusive to iPhones until May 2021, when it created its Android version.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s GIGL partners Nigeria\u2019s JET Motor Company to launch the country\u2019s first electric cargo vans",
          "text": "Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), recently introduced four all-electric cargo vans into its Lagos fleet, in partnership with indigenous automaker, JET Motor Company (JET).\n\nSpeaking during a press conference held at GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub last Friday, GIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, revealed that the partnership \u201cstarted about two years ago, when we approached JET to provide us with a fleet of all-electric cargo vans, for last-mile delivery across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, speaking at the press conference\n\nBack in 2020, about 15 months earlier, JET announced raising $9m solely to fund research and development into building the \u2018Tesla of Africa\u2019. Before that, the almost four-year-old automaker had already established its petrol-powered JET Mover line with a respectable customer base.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing, Rupani Sanjay, maintained at the time that the end goal was Africa-centric electric vehicles (EV), hence the capital raise (which was completed in 2019). The original plan was to launch the \u2018JET EV\u2019 cargo line in Q3 2020. Plans were, however, set back a couple of months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria is ridden with epileptic power supply and other infrastructural challenges that make electric vehicles basically impractical and, as some would argue, near-pointless in the market.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are kicking things off with the four electric vans over an intra-city route,\u201d JET Strategy Lead/Chief Financial Officer, Joseph Wemimo, clarifies.\n\nL-R: Ocholi Etu, Joseph Wemimo, and Rupani Sanjay (second from right) signing the Memorandum of Understanding\n\nBoth parties will be pacing themselves, even as JET is expected to provide GIGL with at least 46 more JET EV vans over the next two years.\n\nIn the meantime, they appear to have a lot of things figured out. For example, each JET EV van ships with a 107.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, which Wemimo says can cover a distance of about 240 km on a single charge.\n\nA peek under the bonnet of GIGL\u2019s JET EV van\n\n\u201cIn fact, they can actually cover over 300 km on a full charge,\u201d Wemimo points out, \u201cbut in our research, after considering traffic and load capacity, among other factors, we found that they can do a minimum of 240 km easily.\u201d\n\nA closeup of the charging station at GIGL\u2019s digital hub, Lagos. The facility can charge two vehicles at a time, to full capacity, all within two hours\n\nOther environment-specific features include shock absorbers that are \u201cstronger than average, higher ground clearance, bigger tires\u201d and other specifications carried over from the JET Mover line, which, as Sanjay explained to Techpoint Africa last year, is a product of over three years of research, testing, and iterative development, inspired by a mix of the best design and technology practices from Europe and Asia, and tropicalised for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a global product that is built to last. We were obsessed with getting it right because, if our vehicles can work well on Nigerian and African roads, they can succeed anywhere in the world,\u201d Sanjay explained at the time.\n\nWith regards to the effect Lagos\u2019 notorious traffic could have on battery life, Wemimo has this to say:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have optimised the batteries to discharge at the rate of only 2% while idling. So even if you spend 10 hours in traffic, you can still easily cover 240km if the battery is fully charged.\u201d\n\nFor perspective, 300km is the driving distance from Lagos to Benin. For even more perspective, a fully charged van that leaves GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub in Gbagada \u2014 currently the only location with charging stations \u2014 sets out for the GIGL outlet along Ilupeju, makes a stop at GIGL Jibowu before heading out for the GIGL outlet along the Lekki-Ajah expressway, and then back to the digital hub, would have covered only about 83km \u2014 roughly one-third of its single-charge capacity.\n\nGoogle Maps estimation of the hypothetical route\n\n\u201cThe plan is to continue establishing more charging stations across Lagos, but this is dependent on demand,\u201d Wemimo explains.\n\n\u201cOur end goal is for GIGL to be fully carbon-neutral,\u201d Etu adds, \u201cmeaning that every vehicle that we use will be fully electric. And hopefully, with support from the government for more charging stations along, say, Sagamu or Ijebu-Ode expressway, we can take it beyond Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhy do they need government support?\u201d you may ask. Wemimo explains:\n\n\u201cIf you look at developed markets like Norway, where the government plans to completely phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2025, there are various incentives \u2014 including tax waivers, cash incentives, and investments \u2014 to encourage mass consumer adoption and innovation in the EV space.\u201d\n\nL-R: Rupani Sanjay and Joseph Wemimo, JET Director of Sales & Marketing and Strategy Lead, respectively\n\nIn the same vein, Sanjay claims that at its current capacity, JET\u2019s Lagos-based assembly plant can produce five to seven vehicles a day \u2014 and about 5,000 annually \u2014 on demand.\n\n\u201cBut in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter how many units we can produce daily if there isn\u2019t enough demand, incentivised by government policies.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, even in South Africa, which is considered Africa\u2019s most developed EV market, only 1,000 out of every 12 million vehicles on the road are said to be electric-powered. Moreover, Cape Verde appears to be the only African country whose government is actively looking (PDF) to phase out electric vehicles within the near future. Compare this with Asia, Europe, and the Americas, where at least 17 countries have similar policies.\n\nNevertheless, GIGL and JET are soldiering on at a deliberate pace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for infrastructure and policy to become favourable. We are moving ahead of the country, and hopefully, the country will catch up with us,\u201d Etu remarks.\n\nWithin the next five to seven years, GIGL hopes to convert over 60% to 70% of its fleet to fully electric vehicles. Furthermore, JET is contractually obligated to offer GIGL one year of free after-sales support and training for internal technicians to aid the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanjay emphasises that JET is open to partnering with more brands and organisations besides GIGL.\n\n\u201cWhile our EV segment currently focuses on the cargo version for intra-city logistics, we are open to partnerships with everyone in Lagos and across Nigeria: private tour companies, medical services, schools, government, and even the military.\u201d\n\nRecommend Watch\n\nNigeria\u2019s Siltech produces electric vehicles, for a cleaner Africa",

Techpoint Africa spoke with customer care representatives from MTN and Airtel, who either claimed ignorance of the strike or said that their services would not be affected.\n\nIf it goes ahead as planned, it could have damaging effects on an economy already grappling with a Twitter ban and widespread insecurity.\n\nInterestingly, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) records that Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry contributed 15.05% to the nation\u2019s GDP in 2020.\n\nFollowing reports of a planned strike by telecommunications workers last year, the Federal Government stepped in. They may do so again.\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nAdegoke Olubisi (CEO), Tito Ovia (Head, Public Growth Sector), Dimeji Sofowora (CFO)\n\nAfter announcing expansion plans last year, Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, has finally launched in Kenya. This comes after its $10 million Series A raise in May 2020.\n\nAt the time of the raise, the startup announced that the funds would be used for its expansion and the development of new products to make the doctor-patient experience more seamless.\n\nCo-founder and Head of Public Sector Growth, Tito Ovia, announced that the startup is already working with three local partners to improve efficiency and provide better service to patients. Simultaneously, it is rolling out its services in Liberia and Uganda.\n\nHelium Health claims to have over 300 healthcare providers and 5,000 health professionals using its technology to improve access to healthcare for patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this move, the six-year-old startup is now present in six West African countries, making it one of the largest healthtech startups in the region.\n\nHealthtech startups in the continent have started getting more recognition, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Disrupt Africa reports that funding for healthtech startups on the continent increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nKenyan startup, MarketForce, has announced the acquisition of Digiduka. The company provides a software solution that allows field agents to record their activities and collect data using handheld devices electronically. This way, businesses can monitor the performance of their sales channels.\n\nOn the other hand, Digiduka helps retailers earn extra money by reselling digital services such as airtime and electricity tokens and also provide them with the payments infrastructure needed to run their businesses.\n\nAccording to Tesh Mbaabu, MarketForce Co-founder and CEO, acquiring Digiduka, rather than competing with them, makes sense as it means the two companies are joining forces to solve a common problem. As part of the buy, Digiduka\u2019s staff will join MarketForce\u2019s team.\n\nFounded in 2018, MarketForce has raised over $2.5 million in funding from investors such as Future Africa, Y Combinator, Ventures Platform, and EchoVC Partners.\n\nAcquisitions are attractive to startups looking to enter new markets, and this seems to be the case with Digiduka. For example, Ajua, a Kenyan consumer experience platform for businesses, bought WayaWaya in April 2021 to take advantage of its payment bots.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nThe biggest stereotypes about young, unemployed Africans.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 Some members of youth corpers deployed to serve in the northern parts of the country have rejected the offers with a reason of Insecurity those states.\n\nThey have however called on the Presidency and National Assembly to intervene by allowing them from the southern part to remind in their respective states because of incessant bandits activities being perpetrate in the said areas.\n\nMostly the complains came from medical corps members who are worried about their lives due to the insecurity in the northern region where cases of Boko Haram, herdsmen and banditry violence have worsened in recent times.\n\nAuthoritative source revealed that the authority of the National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC) have denied applications for redeployment from the north tendered by some southern corps members, mainly doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.\n\nThe medical corps members are worried about their lives due to the insecurity in the northern region where cases of Boko Haram, herdsmen and banditry violence have worsened in recent times.\n\nOne of the corpers who spoke with our correspondent on anonymity, a young doctor said that the relocation forms were filled by the corps members who had health issues while some wanted to redeploy for the sake of insecurity in the region.\n\nHowever, he said they were denied redeployment from the North. Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",
          "summary": "Authoritative source revealed that the authority of the National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC) have denied applications for redeployment from the north tendered by some southern corps members, mainly doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.\nThe medical corps members are worried about their lives due to the insecurity in the northern region where cases of Boko Haram, herdsmen and banditry violence have worsened in recent times.\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\nThis is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting.",

A brush cutter is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawnmower or rotary mower.\n\nIn a letter from SUBEB, signed on behalf of the Executive Chairman by the Public and Private Partnership Officer, Akinlehin Temitope, the board thanked the leading philanthropist and community supporter and offered its warmest regards.\n\nThe letter which is specifically in respect of the donation to Imule Primary in Esan West LGA on March 18, 2021, read in part, \u201cThe Board lauds your generous initiative of complementing her efforts in ensuring quality basic education delivery in Edo State and also looks forward to more partnership in this regard.\u201d\n\nMr. Iseghohimen thanked the Education Board for the gesture noting that he received the letter of commendation with great joy and deep appreciation.

          "title": "Remembering Nigeria\u2019s AFCON 1994 Super Squad",
          "text": "The Nigeria national football squad at Tunisia 1994 Africa Cup of Nations Cup (AFCON) tournament paraded some notable names that made the squad a fearsome proposition and are arguably the best Eagles squad in the nation\u2019s footballing history.\n\nThe team came into the 1994 AFCON tournament as one of the three favourites for the title, which they ended up winning.\n\nThis was after their first triumph in 1980.\n\nThough hampered by the baggage of emerging as runners-up in I984 and 88, coach Clemence Westerhof was determined to end Nigeria\u2019s long search for her second AFCON title and it was a perfect timing.\n\nGrouped alongside Egypt and Gabon in group B, the golden generation approached the competition with caution, but the team began their campaign on a bright note as they dismissed Gabon 3-0 in the opener with two goals coming from the late Rashidi Yekini and Mutiu Adepoju.\n\nTheir second game was a goalless draw against Egypt to book a place in the knockout stages.\n\nZaire were not an easy opponent in the second round but Yekini\u2019s brace took Nigeria into the semi-final to face arch-rivals, Ivory Coast.\n\nIn what was a pulsating encounter that swung back and forth, the Eagles triumphed on penalties after the 90 minutes and extra time ended 2-2.\n\nIt was one man against the world as Zambia earned the sympathy of the football\u2019s global family after its first team perished on the coast of Gabon during World Cup qualifiers.\n\nThe Chipolopolo drew the first blood through Elijah Litana but like a rejected stone turned the corner piece of the building, Emmanuel Amuneke scored twice to ensure Nigeria smiled home with the trophy.\n\nAlloy Agu may have watched from the bench, but he described the tournament as one of the best moments in his career.\n\nHe told PREMIUM TIMES that team spirit and hard work were key to Nigeria\u2019s success in Tunisia.\n\n\u201cIt was a moment I will never forget as a footballer. Yes, we came into the tournament as favourites, but it took hard work and team spirit to win in Tunisia.\n\n\u201cWe were one happy family, and it was a time when Nigerian players were getting to the peak. It gave us the confidence to embrace our career with much optimism, and that was exactly what happened at the World Cup,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 23-man squad\n\nGoalkeepers: Peter Rufai, Wilfred Agbonavbare, Alloy Agu\n\nDefenders: Stephen Keshi, Austin Eguavoen, Uche Okafor, Uche Okechukwu, Isaac Semitoje, Ben Iroha, Nduka Ugbade\n\nMidfielders: Sunday Oliseh, Mutiu Adepoju, Edema Fuludu, Thompson Oliha, Austin Okocha, Efan Ekoku\n\nForwards: Rashidi Yekini, Samson Siasia, Daniel Amokachi, Emmanuel Amuneke, Victor Ikpeba, Finidi George\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nPeter Rufai\n\nRegarded as one of the best goalkeepers to man the post for the senior national team.\n\nWe remember him for his panache and near-perfect reflexes that astounded opposition teams.\n\nRufai was the Eagles\u2019 No.1 in Tunisia 94. His ability to organise his defenders and bail them out in any danger makes him arguably Nigeria\u2019s best ever goalkeeper.\n\nThe former Stationery Stores and Femo Scorpions goalkeeper also played for Dragon FC of Benin, Lokeren, Beveren (in Belgium). He also had a successful career at Farense (Portugal), Hercules, and Deportivo La Coruna in Spain.\n\nRufai who jettisoned a chance to be crowned as King of Idimu kingdom currently shuttles between Lagos and Spain.\n\nOnce an ambassador of Remita, he runs youth football clinics in Lagos.\n\nWilfred Agbonavbare (Late)\n\nHe was tipped to be No.1 despite his healthy rivalry with Alloy Agu in the qualifiers, but after weeks of training camp in Papendal and Amsterdam, Holland, he dropped to third in the pecking order of goalkeepers.\n\nIt was an enormous setback for the former Rayo Vallecano goalkeepers as Rufai rediscovered his mojo to claim the No.1 jersey.\n\nHe watched from the bench as Rufai got better with matches. Agbonavbare suffered one of the worst racist abuse in Spain after his penalty save denied Real Madrid the chance of beating Barcelona to the title in 1992.\n\nMadrid fans chanted racist slurs like, \u201cNegro cabron, recoge al algodon\u201d meaning \u201cblack bastard, pick the cotton!\u201d\n\nAgbonavbare retired at the early age of 31 and resettled in Madrid, and worked as a baggage and cargo handler at Barajas airport, Madrid.\n\nHe also had a brief stint as a goalkeeper trainer. He lost his wife to cancer in 2012 and died of a similar disease in 2015.\n\nAlloy Agu\n\nHe was the second goalkeeper in the 1994 squad that Clemence Westerhof listed for the 2006 African Cup of Nations in Tunisia.\n\nHe was one of the first Nigerian goalkeepers to feature in the Dutch Eredivisie before calling it quits with active football. Agu is currently under the payroll of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) as Super Eagles\u2019 goalkeeper trainer.\n\nAustin Eguavoen\n\nConverted from a midfielder into a full-back, \u2018Cerezo\u2019 was a dominant part of the back-four that took the Eagles to the 1994 AFCON title.\n\nHe combined well with the late Uche Okafor, Uche Okechukwu, and Ben Iroha to keep opposing strikers at bay. Westerhof handed him the responsibility of leading the Eagles in the finals after injury ruled out skipper Stephen Keshi.\n\nHe worked as Super Eagles manager at Egypt 2006 AFCON where Nigeria settled for Bronze. He currently works with the NFF as a member of the technical committee.\n\nBen Iroha\n\nHe was the preferred choice ahead of Nduka Ugbade, given the embarrassment of talents at Westerhof\u2019s disposal, and he justified his inclusion in the squad with his ability to combine his defensive and attacking instinct.\n\nHis one-two pass gave Nigeria an early lead against Cote d\u2019Ivoire in the semi-finals and kept a watertight defence to ensure Nigeria overran the stubborn Zambians in the finals.\n\nIroha had an unsuccessful stint overseas and retired in 2000. He was an assistant coach when Nigeria won THE 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup in South Korea and was once on the payroll of Heartland and Dolphins. He currently lives in the US.\n\nUche Okechukwu\n\nThe \u2018Gentle Giant\u2019 will be forever remembered as the towering presence behind Nigeria\u2019s successful stint at Tunisia 94.\n\nThe former Brondby and Fenerbahce centre-back also featured for Ocean Boys and Bayelsa United after a successful stint in Europe.\n\nUche retired from active football at 41 and neither embraced coaching nor featured in club events because of his shyness. He is currently based in Owerri running his business.\n\nStephen Keshi\n\nThe \u2018Big Boss\u2019 is one of the best centre-backs Africa has ever produced.\n\nAlthough late Keshi got injured weeks into the tournament, coach Westerhof opted to pick him because he was an inspirational captain of the squad.\n\nHe was seen whispering and charging his teammates to go to this kill as Nigeria went to win her second AFCON in Tunisia.\n\nWith a successful career in Belgium, Ivory Coast, and France, Keshi retired from active football following a nagging ankle injury and embraced coaching. He was in charge when flying Eagles Eagles crashed out of African Youth Championship in Ethiopia but he was part of the Eagles coaching crew that qualified Nigeria for the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup.\n\nKeshi also qualified Togo for her first World Cup and handled the Eagles of Mali before returning to tinker Nigeria to the 2013 AFCON title in South Africa before leading the Eagles to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nKeshi died of cardiac arrest on June 7, 2016, in Benin City.\n\nIsaac Semitoje\n\nThe former Super Eagles and Iwuanyanwu sweeper sat on the bench through the tournament, given the pedigree of other defenders in the team.\n\nWesterhof dropped him from the USA 94 squad. Semitoje is currently based in Benin and he is into personal business.\n\nNduka Ugbade\n\nPopularly known as Sao Paulo by his Eagles teammates, the former U-17 skipper also watched from the bench as Nigeria emerged as African champions after beating Zambia 2-1 in the finals.\n\nHe had a short stint in Israel and retired from active football because of injury. Ugbade enjoyed a successful spell as a youth coach after he assisted Garba Manu to U-17 World Cup glory in 2013.\n\nHe currently handles the NNL side, Giants Brillas.\n\nAustin Okocha\n\nThis mercurial midfielder was one of the best playmakers Nigeria ever produced.\n\nHe gave the world a slice of his talents in Tunisia 94 and combined well with Sunday Oliseh to propel Nigeria to her second AFCON glory.\n\nJay-jay played for PSG, Fenerbahce Bolton Wanderers, and retired too early according to his teeming fans.\n\nHe went into business after retirement. Okocha is the brand ambassador for a long list of companies.\n\nMutiu Adepoju\n\nThe \u2018Headmaster\u2019 was part of the squad in Tunisia and he was on the score sheet in Nigeria 3-0 win over Gabon in the group opening match.\n\nThe former 3SC team manager spent most of his career in Spain, where he scored 22 goals from 175 matches. He is the current Spanish La Liga ambassador in Nigeria and also manages his personal businesses.\n\nEfan Ekoku\n\nEkoku featured in Nigeria\u2019s 2-0 win over Zaire in the quarter-final of Tunisia 94 World Cup and had to be replaced when he struggled to have a single shot at goal.\n\nThe former Norwich and Bournemouth striker once worked as a commentator for Premier League production. He is based in the UK and works as a soccer pundit.\n\nEdema Fuludu\n\nA fringe member of the Tunisia 1994 AFCON winning team, Edema was respected for his hard work and business-like approach to matches.\n\nThe former Julius Berger star played his last active game for Turkish side Always SK before retiring from football.\n\nHe lives in Delta and is actively involved in politics.\n\nThompson Oliha (Late)\n\nHe was known as the team warhorse for his tireless play.\n\nHe came as the best replacement for Moses Kpakor, who quit the scene because of a career-ending injury. Whenever Westerhof saw danger from the opposition, he deployed Oliha to keep such a player at bay.\n\nOliha was Westerhof\u2019s beloved player because of his work rate and dedication. Oliha worked with the Kwara football academy before his death in 2013.\n\nDaniel Amokachi\n\n\u2018Da Bull\u2019 was a key member of the winning side, and his tenacity and work rate played a huge role in ensuring that Nigeria emerged champions in Tunisia and he featured in two AFCON and World Cup tournaments.\n\nAmokachi won the English FA Cup with Everton under manager Joe Royle and joined Besiktas in Turkey and tinkered Nasarawa FC and was the assistant coach to late Stephen Keshi as Nigeria won her third AFCON in 2013.\n\nAmokachi is currently the special adviser on sports to President Muhammadu Buhari. He is also an ambassador for a couple of brands.\n\nEmmanuel Amuneke\n\nAmuneke scored Nigeria\u2019s two goals in the finals after Westerhof deliberately confined him to the bench throughout the group matches and knockout stages.\n\nHe took the pressure off top players like Keshi before the \u201cDutchgerian\u201d threw the former Zamalek winger into the fray.

Although he had a quiet tourney, his contribution cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe former Ajax winger played for Real Betis and was known for his matador\u2019s style of celebration after scoring a goal. He once applied for the Golden Eaglets\u2019 job and he currently lives in Spain.\n\nRashidi Yekini (Late)\n\nCAF adjudged the goalsfather as the dreaded striker at Tunisia 94, where he scored five goals.\n\nYekini was on duty in Nigeria\u2019S 3-0 win over Gabon in Group B opener, scoring two goals with Mutiu Adepoju on the scoring sheet.\n\nGangling Yekini also bagged a brace in Nigeria\u2019s 2-0 win over Zaire in the quarter-finals and a goal against Cote d\u2019Ivoire in the semi-finals.\n\nThe former Shooting Stars striker gave in to depression in the latter days of his life, although his death is still a mystery to many that were close to him.\n\nSamson Siasia\n\nSiasia is regarded as one of the most skillful strikers of the golden generation, even though he failed to score a goal in the competition.\n\nSiasia had a successful career as a coach leading Nigeria to silver in the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

A discovery from Nigeria\u2019s youth system, he had stints in Belgium with Standard Liege, Monaco where he was at his most prolific and won Africa\u2019s best player award in 1997.\n\nHe now works as football pundit with Super Sports.\n\nSunday Oliseh\n\nOliseh played a vital role in ensuring that Nigeria emerged as African champions in Tunisia 94.\n\nHis combative style of football paved way for the likes of Okocha and Mutiu Adepoju to attack without restraint.\n\nThe former Juventus and Ajax midfielder had a successful coaching career with Fortuna Sittard FC before coming over to manage Super Eagles in 2015.

          "text": "Banditry in the Northwestern section of Nigeria, according to a group of bandits, began when Zamfara was created out of Sokoto in 1996 under the reign of the late military Head of State, Sani Abacha.\n\nThe bandits stated this in a video interview with Daily Trust published on Wednesday.\n\nFulani herdsmen have been exposed to humiliation, hardship, and neglect in the past under democratic regimes that began in 1999 and have pushed them to take up arms, according to the gang\u2019s commander, who spoke in Hausa.\n\nAccording to them, successive Nigerian administrations have failed to share the country\u2019s wealth with the nomads, leaving them illiterate and hungry, forcing them to resort to banditry to survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long we started. We started not long after Zamfara State was created. We took up arms because we are herders and despite this country\u2019s wealth, we are not carried along, we are not educated, we do not know anything. We do not have security, we do not have any benefit.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones being killed but are always seen as the aggressors. We don\u2019t have anything. Wherever a herder is, he is uneducated and has nothing. In this country, there is everything but we are not carried along. It is as if though we don\u2019t exist. We are just being killed,\u201d the leader of the gang said in the video.\n\nHe also mentioned a pact that the Nigerian government had previously broken, which was supposed to put a stop to banditry in the region.\n\nThe bandits stated that the government failed to keep its half of the bargain, bemoaning that killings occur on a daily basis in the North West, with no respect for tribe.\n\n\u201cOf course, it has been breached. You have asked for an armistice. An agreement was reached but you left that person in the forest with a gun and nothing was to substitute. What do you expect? How do you want that person to survive?\n\n\u201cAll promises made to us, none of them was fulfilled and nothing was done to enrol the young ones in schools. We should be treated the same way and given jobs, by the government. The Hausa, Yoruba, and Fulani should be treated equally,\u201d the bandits said.\n\nSpeaking, the leader of the marauding gang said President Muhammadu Buhari should head the peace talks if he is serious about ending banditry and insecurity in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the bandits claimed they supported President Buhari because he promised to fix the country, but they can see now that the promise was merely a fantasy.\n\n\u201cThe president should personally come and preside over the talks. When he was campaigning, he travelled all over, why would he not do it now? He does not take these peace talks seriously and every day people are being killed. There is no day that someone is not killed between Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, Sokoto, and Katsina. No two days pass without someone getting killed in these places.\n\n\u201cThere is no tribe that is spared. Gunmen kill, soldiers kill, vigilantes kill. Whoever you see with a gun today in Nigeria, uses it to kill people. You may not know, but if I were to tell you the situation of things in this country, you will cry. Even the president will cry. We supported this administration and accepted dialogue because we thought he will fix the country but he won\u2019t fix the country.\n\n\u201cFrom the time he praised Goodluck (Jonathan), (Olusegun) Obasanjo, and late (Umaru) Yar\u2019Adua. These were not praiseworthy. It would have been better if he had praised (Sani) Abacha because, under Abacha, pastoralists were being educated. During Abacha, there was allocation in the budget for the nomadic communities. There was no such thing again since Obasanjo became president.\n\n\u201cThey stopped looking after Fulani. Their forests and grazing areas were taken over. You will see one person having as much as 1,000 hectares, just because he is rich,\u201d the leader said.",

John Akpanudoedehe , the party congratulated president Buhari and Nigerians, saying the Train 7 NLNG project is part of the Decade for Gas Development Initiative which was an element of the National Gas Policy of 2017 articulated by the Buhari-led administration.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Train 7 which is designed to produce 8 million metric tones of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and condensates annually promises to lift Nigeria\u2019s LNG production to 30 million metric tones per annum from the current 22 million metric tones.\n\nThe statement further stated that In addition to diversifying the country\u2019s economy in line with the promise made to Nigerians by the APC, the project adds to the long list of major strategic projects being implemented by the APC-led administration of President Buhari.\n\nThe APC boasted that the project will boost Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earning, create thousands of jobs during and after construction, contribute to the country\u2019s industrial development as well as encourage the use of gas as fuel of choice for domestic purposes.

          "text": "A Lagos High Court sitting in the Ikeja area has sentenced former managing director of defunct Bank PHB, Francis Atuche to over 6 years in prison.\n\nIn a judgment that lasted over 10 hours, Justice Lateefat Okunnu convicted Atuche alongside a former Chief Financial Officer of the bank, Ugo Anyanwu.\n\nThe two were convicted on at least 6 of a 27-count amended charge of conspiracy to commit a felony and stealing brought against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nWhile Atuche who was found guilty on counts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 23 of the charge would serve a 6-year term for each count, Anyanwu will serve a 4-year jail term for counts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 22 and 24 of the amended charge.\n\nThey are to serve their jail term consecutively. This sentence is coming after a trial that lasted over 12 years.\n\nIn delivering her sentence, Justice Okunnu held that the EFCC successfully proved its case against the convicts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe judge rejected claims by the defendants suggesting that they were merely professionally negligent.\n\nShe specifically held that Atuche and Anyanwu abused their powers, ignored established rules and regulations thereby putting the bank and depositors\u2019 funds in danger.\n\nThe court also came to the conclusion that the convicts corruptly took advantage of their positions to confer on themselves undue financial benefits without regard to the health of the bank.\n\n\u201cThe convict stole from the bank and depositors and because of their action, taxpayers money was used to bail out the bank\u201d.\n\nJustice Okunnu held that she had considered the plea of the convicts, but there must be consequences for wrongdoing, adding that sentences are not just for punishment but also for deterrence.\n\nShe also ruled that the defendant should make restitution of the amount stolen from the bank. They are to pay back the sum of N25.7billion to the Federal government to replace the funds stolen from the public to bail out the bank.\n\nAccording to the Judge, they are to serve their jail terms at the Kirikiri maximum correctional facility in Lagos.\n\nAtuche\u2019s wife cleared\n\nJustice Okunnu however, cleared Atuche\u2019s wife on the charge of conspiracy and stealing.\n\nAccording to the judge, the EFCC failed to link her to the crime and insisted that suspicion no matter how strong can not take the place of fact.\n\nThe judge held that it was not proven that she was aware of the source of the funds she received into her account from her husband and she had no powers to take any decision to influence the transaction.\n\nCharges\n\nThe EFCC had alleged that between November 2007 and April 2008, the accused persons stole about N25.7bn belonging to the bank.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had also claimed that of the total N25.7bn, they stole about N14.7bn by fraudulently describing it as a loan to some companies and subsequently converted the said sum to personal use.\n\nThe Commission had listed the companies as Future View Securities, Extra Oil Limited, Resolution Trust and Investment Limited, and Tradjek Nigeria Ltd.\n\nThe EFCC also alleged that another N11bn stolen by the defendants was used to purchase about 984,375,000 units of Bank PHB shares for themselves.\n\nAccording to the commission, the sum used for purchasing the shares was described as a loan to some companies including, Guesstrade Services, Sentron Trading, Montrax Investico, Claremount Management Ltd., Trenton Trade, and others.\n\nIn proof of its case against the accused persons, the EFCC called 12 witnesses who gave oral evidence. It also subpoenaed 6 others to present some documents which were admitted as exhibits by the court.",

          "text": "The Presidency has said that the latest Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum communiqu\u00e9 is a spectacular demonstration to Nigerians as to why the opposition party and its representatives should not be entrusted with the national leadership of the country at any time soon.\n\nThis comment is in reaction to the PDP governors\u2019 take on the operations of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the deteriorating economic and security situation in the country,\n\nGovernors elected on the platform of the PDP had on Monday raised an alarm over what they termed the \u2018OPAQUE\u2019 manner in which the NNPC carries out its operations.\n\nThe governors decried the recent NNPC\u2019s decision not to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, thereby \u201cstarving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general well-being\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: PDP Governors Demand Decentralisation Of Security Operations To Tackle Threat\n\nThe governors maintained that under the Constitution, the NNPC is duty-bound to make proceeds of sale or business of Petroleum available to the Federation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations.\n\nCommenting on the issue through the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the presidency argued that in bemoaning the decision by the NNPC not to make contributions to the Federation Account, the governors appear to believe NNPC can spend the same money twice: once on the petroleum subsidy \u2013 which they all support \u2013 and then on their States via the Federation Account.\n\nIn a communique on Wednesday, Mr. Shehu noted that the \u201cNNPC is a trustee for the nation \u2013 and this means it must manage its finances with prudence and for the long-term to safeguard the financial support it bestows on our country. What the governors are asking of NNPC is to \u201cbreak the bank\u201d for their own profligate political ends\u201d.\n\n\u201cSimilar profligacy and contradiction are in full view with their call to the Central Bank to appreciate the value of the Naira. This would damage exports \u2013 including oil revenues on which NNPC depends \u2013 as well as damage small businesses and employment. But an appreciated currency would benefit those spending on luxuries from abroad \u2013 this, no doubt, being the leading desire of a typical PDP governor.\n\n\u201cWhen the governors claim a lack of federal institutions\u2019 money pouring into their States\u2019 coffers is an affront to democracy, constitutionalism, and federalism, they fail to mention the ugliest trend against the integrity of Nigeria comes by own hands with their refusal to support the Federal Government\u2019s earnest desire to reinstate the local government as the third tier and finding a lasting solution to farmer-herder conflicts costing the nation lives and livestock.\n\n\u201cThis initiative brings rights and support for generations of all ages to bring solutions to challenges that different communities of our country have faced but the PDP governors reject it \u2013 denying all Nigerians their constitutional right to live and work in any state of the Federation \u2013 preferring to appeal to ethnic division and hatred rather than support the first practical solution offered since independence,\u201d the president\u2019s spokesman stated.\n\nMr. Shehu also was of the opinion that the governors appealed to each other for more involvement of states in mining and geophysical activities within their states, which does beg the question as to why it has taken them so long.\n\nAccording to him, such opportunities and states\u2019 powers have been fully available since independence \u2013 yet only now do the PDP realise it.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, the PDP grieve over the Federal Government\u2019s action over Twitter \u2013 for it represents the curtailment of their ability to use the platform to spread fake news and invented stories to the detriment of community and good-neighbourliness between the peoples of Nigeria,\u201d the president\u2019s media aide stressed.\n\nIn his summation, Mr. Shehu said the PDP Governors propose no solutions to any of the nation\u2019s challenges in the face of COVID and global economic downturn: \u201cinstead, they grasp for more money and mourn their lack of access to social media to spread falsehoods and hate\u201d.\n\nHe further opined that their statement is evidence if any were needed, as to why the President and the APC ended the PDP\u2019s one-party rule in 2015, why the ruling party was re-elected by an increased margin in 2019, and why their winning trend is set to continue far into the future.",

          "text": "Hopes of freedom for popular Nollywood actor, James Olanrewaju, popularly known as Baba Ijesha was dashed on Wednesday following the ruling by a Chief Magistrate court sitting in the Yaba area of Lagos.\n\nThe actor is charged with alleged indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault-which contravenes sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262, and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to all the five-count leveled against him.\n\nDuring the reading of the counts, Magistrate Nwaka noted that Baba Ijesha kept bending over and showing signs of discomfort and this prompted the question:\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\n\n\u201cDo you want to sit down?\n\n\u201cGive him a chair to sit on,\u201d the Magistrate said.\n\nThe police prosecutor in the matter has however told the Magistrate that proceedings concerning Baba Ijesha will now be handled by the DPP following information filed before the High Court.\n\nOn his part, counsel to the defendant, Kayode Olabiran made a fresh application for bail of Baba Ijesha.\n\nREAD ALSO: Three In EFCC Custody Over Currency Counterfeiting\n\nHe said, \u201cMr Olanrewaju has remained in police custody because one of the bail conditions is yet to be met.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn May 17, the Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary, the NBA, and the police took an initiative to decongest jam-packed cells across the State. My client was one of the beneficiaries and the conditions given were \u2013 two sureties, one must be a blood relation and another surety not less than level 16 in the Lagos State government civil service.\n\n\u201cThe elder brother to the defendant has appeared as a surety and we have paid the N500,000 bail bond to the account of the Lagos State government but we have not been able to get a level 16 officer to stand as surety,\u201d Mr Olabiran said.\n\nExplaining further, the lawyer said they got three different levels 16 officers but one turned them down along the line and two others declined upon hearing that they need to get a clearance letter from the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThe level 16 officers are afraid of being issued a query. We are applying for bail on compassionate ground and in the interest of justice,\u201d Mr Olabiran added, urging the Magistrate to consider the visibly ill health of his client.\n\nA counsel from the office of the DPP, Mobolaji Owoebute-Okedeji, opposed the bail application.\n\nHe said the matter has been already filed at the High Court, and he urged the court to refuse bail.\n\nIn his ruling, Magistrate Peter Nwaka refused to vary his bail condition on charges of rape, sexual assault, and abuse of a minor.\n\nAfter considering all the submissions, Magistrate Nwaka declined to grant the defendant bail on the grounds that he no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n\u201cI have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP.\n\n\u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given,\u201d the Magistrate said.\n\nThe court also ordered that the defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court and adjourned the matter to July 13 for mention.",

These injuries isn\u2019t just \u201cPART OF THE GAME\u201d.\u201d\n\nInstead, James said, the injuries were due to the \u201clack of rest\u201d before play restarted in December \u2014 just 72 days after the Lakers locked up the title with a victory over the Miami Heat in the quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida.\n\nLeonard was ruled out of Wednesday\u2019s game against the Utah Jazz with a sprained right knee, suffered during the Clippers\u2019 series-leveling win in game four on Monday.\n\nUS media reports said Leonard could miss the remainder of the series, although the Clippers said there was \u201cno timetable\u201d for the two-time NBA champion\u2019s return.\n\nLeonard joins a phalanx of players who have been affected by injury in the playoffs, including James himself and teammate Anthony Davis \u2014 who suffered a groin strain during the Lakers\u2019 first-round series loss to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBrooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving is set to miss a second straight game of the Nets\u2019 second-round series against Milwaukee after teammate James Harden missed three straight contests.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers have coped with injuries that sidelined Joel Embiid, while Utah has dealt with injuries to Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley.\n\nJames noted that eight, possibly nine All-Star players have missed playoff games.\n\n\u201cThis is the best time of the year for our league and fans but missing a ton of our fav players,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d",

          "title": "\u2018Two Great Powers\u2019: Biden, Putin Plunge into Hours of Talks",
          "text": "With stern expressions and polite words before the cameras, President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin plunged into hours of face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders say relations between their countries are at an all-time low.\n\nBiden called it a discussion between \u201ctwo great powers\u201d and said it was \u201calways better to meet face to face.\u201d Putin said he hoped the talks would be \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nThe meeting in a book-lined room had a somewhat awkward beginning \u2014 both men appeared to avoid looking directly at each other during a brief and chaotic photo opportunity before a scrum of jostling reporters.\n\nBiden nodded when a reporter asked if Putin could be trusted, but the White House quickly sent out a tweet insisting that the president was \u201cvery clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally.\u201d\n\nPutin ignored shouted questions from reporters, including whether he feared jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe two leaders did shake hands \u2014 Biden extended his hand first and smiled at the stoic Russian leader \u2014 moments earlier when they posed with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who welcomed them to Switzerland for the summit.\n\nBiden and Putin first held a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side had a translator for the session, which lasted about an hour and a half. The meeting, after about a 40-minute break, then expanded to include senior aides on each side. Biden and Putin were expected to meet for a total of four to five hours of wide-ranging talks.\n\nFor months, they have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden has repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, for the jailing of Russia\u2019s foremost opposition leader and for interference in American elections.\n\nPutin has reacted with whatabout-isms and denials \u2014 pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn\u2019t been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.\n\nIn advance of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, both sides set out to lower expectations.\n\nEven so, Biden said it was an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find \u201cstability and predictability\u201d in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America\u2019s fiercest adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe should decide where it\u2019s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that,\u201d Biden told reporters earlier this week. \u201cAnd the areas where we don\u2019t agree, make it clear what the red lines are.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no breakthroughs were expected and that \u201cthe situation is too difficult in Russian-American relations.\u201d He added that \u201cthe fact that the two presidents agreed to meet and finally start to speak openly about the problems is already an achievement.\u201d\n\nArrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated.\n\nBiden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year\u2019s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.\n\nPutin and his entourage arrived first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva\u2019s biggest park. Next came Biden and his team. Putin flew into Geneva on Wednesday shortly before the scheduled start of the meeting; Biden \u2014 who was already in Europe for meetings with allies \u2014 arrived the day before.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the U.S. president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.\n\nBiden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China\u2019s Xi Jinping during his rise to power.\n\nHe has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an \u201cautocrat,\u201d and more conventional Western leaders including Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau.\n\nBut with Putin, who he has said has \u201cno soul,\u201d Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who has remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bright. He\u2019s tough,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I have found that he is a \u2014 as they say \u2026 a worthy adversary.\u201d\n\nThe White House held on to hope of finding small areas of agreement.\n\nNo commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.\n\nBiden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control agreements.\n\nThe Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched alarming attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.\n\nThe Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won\u2019t engage on the matter. White House officials said, however, Biden intended to bring up the matter.\n\nThe meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn\u2019t unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon a rriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn\u2019t sweating his big meeting.\n\n\u201cI am always ready,\u201d Biden said.\n\n___",
