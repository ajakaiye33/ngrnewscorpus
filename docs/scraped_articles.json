          "title": "Steer clear of alleged support for Igboho, Yoruba group tells Obasanjo",
          "text": "Former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nA socio-cultural group, Yoruba for One Nigeria Forum, YONF, has urged former President, Olusegun Obasanjo to clear his name over purported media reports that he is lobbying Benin Republic to shield Sunday Adeyemi popularly known as Igboho from facing prosecution.\n\nThe group in a statement titled, \u201cOlusegun Obasanjo is the Greatest Beneficiary of Nigeria\u2019s Unity\u201d and signed by its National President, Seun Adebayo Lawal explained that the call became necessary in view of the significant benefits the former President and Yoruba nation as a whole have gained from one united Nigeria.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe attention of our organization has been drawn to media reports that former President Olusegun Obasanjo has embarked on a mission in Benin Republic to shield Sunday Adeyemi popularly known as Igboho, who is currently facing multiple criminal charges in the country and on Department of State Services, DSS wanted list in Nigeria from being prosecuted.\n\n\u201cRecall that the self-styled violent agitator has been on the run following his invitation by the Department of State Services\u201d, the group noted.\n\nIt further averred that Nigeria has not given Yoruba nation agitators a reason to pursue emancipation, stressing that Obasanjo should know this better than anyone else especially being a two-time President of a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile we hope that this unpatriotic move is not true, we expect the former President to issue a clear statement on the allegations to inform Nigerians of his position. This is important because of the imminent misconceptions his silence is generating on this matter. It is our position as a native Yoruba indigenous organization that the alleged move by Obasanjo needs to be censored so as to set records straight for posterity and history.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian history, in its present form has recorded the Yoruba nation as the greatest beneficiaries of Nigeria\u2019s unity since independence. Ironically former President Olusegun Obasanjo is a Yoruba man who has benefited the most from whatever gains Nigeria made of her unity. Obasanjo is the only Nigerian of pure Yoruba descent who has ever ruled this country under the military and civilian dispensations. What more could Nigeria have offered to him or the Yoruba nation? What dues were deserving of the Yoruba nation that Obasanjo could not make up during his time as Head of State and President? He does not need to be reminded of the role Nigeria\u2019s unity played in his rise, both as a military and civilian President thus, the least he owes this nation is to preach peace, promote and advocate for a one united and indissoluble Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf Obasanjo is desirous of creating a sustainable and one united Nigeria, he should utilize his international contacts in the overall benefit of the Nigerian State and its people. Any attempt by Obasanjo or any group to scuttle legitimate efforts by the Nigerian government to ensure that Igboho faces justice would not be forgiven by patriotic Nigerians. The resistance of such moves, no matter how clandestine will be equally resisted by the Nigerian people\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nContinuing, the group stressed that \u201cas a Yoruba indigenous group, we will not look the other way when those who have exploited the most of Nigeria\u2019s unity turn to sabotage government peace efforts. We call on former President Olusegun Obasanjo to utilize his international privileges to champion the unity of this country. After all, he got those privileges from the benevolence of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cIt is perhaps too late for any individual in the echelon of former President Olusegun Obasanjo to contemplate a divided Nigeria at this moment. We must therefore make this clarion call to all Yoruba indigenous people to show solidarity with the Nigerian government to achieve the long-desired hope of one Nigeria built on unity, peace and progress\u201d, the statement added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Women farmers in Bauchi State have been urged to explore other areas of agriculture like fishery and livestock production to fight poverty and tackle food insecurity instead of total concentration on crops production.\n\nThe advice was given by the acting permanent secretary in the Bauchi State Ministry of Agriculture, Barrister Saratu Jibrin, while receiving women farmers, under the aegis of Public Finance on Agriculture (PFA) Committee in her office.\n\nAccording to the permanent secretary, there are lots of opportunities in the livestock and fishery sectors of agriculture, which she said could create more jobs for women in both urban and rural areas as well as guarantee food security for the state in particular and the country as a whole.\n\nJibrin submitted that some cultural practices might prevent women from going to farm, adding that such women could engage in livestock and fishery within their households.\n\n\u201cWe must be mindful of our culture and tradition which may hinder some women from going to the farms even for security reasons. But rearing of domestic animals and fishery can conveniently be undertaken by such women within their households, Jibrin said.\n\nWhile saying that most women are unaware of various loan schemes put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the permanent secretary called on the Apex Bank to scale up its level of awareness about the loan schemes.\n\nJibrin then appealed to women farmers in the state to always update their financial records to promote accountability and transparency, declaring that no donor, including the CBN, would be willing to grant loans to groups with bad records.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the chairperson of the committee, Mrs Tabawa Atiku, informed that with the support of ActionAid Nigeria, women farmers in the state were granted basic and affordable agricultural machinery like power tillers and improved seedlings.\n\nThis, she said, was with a view to promoting increased agricultural activities in the state to fight hunger and poverty.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that, because of the successes achieved since 2011 when the programme started, ActionAid Nigeria with the support of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has extended the programme by one year and equally renamed the programme as Scaling Up Public Investment in Agriculture (SUPIA),\u201d she informed.\n\nShe then reminded the state government of its pledge to employ extension workers and also fulfil its promise to train women farmers in various aspects of agriculture, including livestock production.\n\nAtiku also called on the ministry to ensure that its officials write what she termed \u201cdefendable and impact-oriented memos\u201d, which she said would easily attract government\u2019s approval rather than uncoordinated and unattractive memos that could be thrown into the dustbin.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Itua, Abuja and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nMembers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Working Committee (NWC) have clashed over the legality of a meeting where six members called for the immediate resignation of the National Chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the nine NWC members led by the deputy national chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif, met at Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on Sunday night over the crisis in the party.\n\nThere are 19 NWC members, comprising 12 national officers, and six national vice chairmen in charge of the six geo-political zones.\n\nHowever, the PDP National Legal Adviser, Emmanuel Enoidem, described the meeting as a nullity as it is only the national chairman or two-third of NWC members that can convene a meeting of the party organ.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, six of the NWC members including Nazif; Mai Adamu Mustapher, National Auditor; Sunday Udeh- Okoye; Taofiq Arapaja, national vice chairman (South West); Chief Dan Orbih, national vice chairman (South South) and Chief Ali Odefa, national vice chairman (South East) called for Secondus\u2019 immediate resignation.\n\nOthers who attended the meeting were Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri, national secretary; Abdulahi Maibasira, national financial secretary and Chief Theophilus Dakas, national vice chairman (North Central).\n\nThe aggrieved NWC members resolved to forward their resolution to the PDP Governors Forum, the BoT and other organs of the party.\n\nRegardless, Secondus, in a statement by his media adviser, , Ike Abonyi, insisted that he would not resign as has done nothing wrong to warrant it.\n\nThe PDP chairman challenged \u201ctiny minority\u201d calling for his resignation to come clean and tell party stalwarts the main reason they want him out of office.\n\nEnoidem, in a WhatsApp message shared to some members of the NWC, noted that \u201cby Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.\n\nSubsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\u201d\n\nHe contended that \u201cas a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of NWC summoned by the national chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of resignation of any officer of our party at any level is a personal decision as stipulated in Sections 45(1) & 47 (5).\n\n\u201cThere is no provision of our constitution which donates powers to any organ, individuals or group of persons to ask an officer of the party to resign for any reason whatsoever as was purported in the so called press release.\n\n\u201cThe powers to remove any member of the NWC and indeed any national officer is reserved in the national convention which is due for December 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is more so when the purported meeting was said to have been convened on Sunday August 8, 2021 against the widely published position taken by the BoT advising members and leaders of our party to maintain peace until a committee set up has deliberated on the raging controversies.\u201d\n\nThis came as some support groups under the platform of Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups lent their voice to call for Secondus to resign.\n\nDuring a protest at the party\u2019s National secretariat in Abuja, the Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups accused Secondus of polarising the party for his own selfish interest while also alleging that he was responsible for the defection of three governors and some senators from the party to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nIts leader, Tamunotonye Inioribo, who addressed the media, alleged that no department of the PDP was functioning under Secondus, and he was also creating factions within state branches of the party.\n\nThe protesters were seen carrying placards with different inscriptions such \u201cSecondus Must Go\u201d, \u201cwe have lost confidence in your chairmanship\u201d, \u201cwe cannot afford to lose more governors\u201d, among others.\n\nThe party organs, including the NWC, Board of Trustees and others, have activated conflict resolution mechanisms to wade into the crisis ahead of the party\u2019s National Elective Convention, expected to hold in December.\n\nThis is as members of the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives have disagreed over calls for the resignation the party\u2019s national chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nThe PDP caucus, in the House, in a statement by Kingsley Chinda and Chukwuka Onyema, leader and deputy leader, respectively, on Sunday night, called on Secondus to resign immediate in the interest of the opposition party.\n\nHowever, the minority leader, House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said he has no knowledge of any meeting by the PDP caucus, where decision was taken to call for the resignation of Secondus.\n\nElumelu, in a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cIf such a meeting held, it was without the knowledge of the leadership of the Minority Caucus, and therefore in breach of established procedure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working in concert with organs of the party to ensure sustainable resolution of the current challenges that will be in the overall interest of the party and Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThis came as former governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, opposed plans to force him out.\n\nDickson who represents Bayelsa West, in a statement he personally signed, said the decision of a few members of the party to force Secondus out did not represent their views.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, only the national chairman of the party can summon and preside over meetings of the organs of the party especially the NWC of which he is chairman. So, the purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: 3 members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee. By the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement leaving out the majority of 13 who were not at the meeting and the chairman who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crises in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "No fewer than six persons were reportedly killed in separate incidents as the sit-at-home directive by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) took a bloody turn in Nkwogu, Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area of Abia and Nnewi, Nnewi North Local Government Area of Anambra State, yesterday.\n\nFollowing abduction of Nnamdi Kanu in Kenya by security agents in collaboration with Nigeria government and rearraignment in a Federal High Court in Abuja for continuation of his trial by the Department of State Services (DSS), the pro-Biafran group declared sit-at-home for every Monday until his release.\n\nIn Abia, the exercise witnessed the setting ablaze of three passengers in a transport company vehicle while the driver was shot by gunmen.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Michael Abattam, said the incident was under investigation.\n\nIn Nnewi, eyewitnesses said they heard gun shots at Izuchukwu Junction as early as 6am and found bodies of two young men. But nobody could explain who shot them.\n\nSources said one of them was suspected to be a leader of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), and the other, a commercial motorcyclist in the area.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, said he did not have details: \u201cYes, something happened in Nnewi but the information is still sketchy. There is a little bonfire on the road but the police have removed them. We are still monitoring the situation. Police presence is everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe sit-at-home order witnessed partial compliance in Imo State as most shops and other public places were initially under lock and key in the early hours of 7 and 8 am. But someshops later opened for business.\n\nAt Orlu, believed to be the epicentre of crisis in recent times, roads such Banana junction, Okporo among others were deserted and shops closed. Except for vehicles of security operatives patrolling the roads, the roads were deserted. All banks were also shut.\n\nAt the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, three airlines had touched down at press time but the passengers remain stranded as there were no airport taxis or commercial motorcycles to take them to their various destinations. The roads leading to the airport were a shadow even as vendors selling around the airport did not turn up for business. The popular Douglas road where the Eke-Ukwu Owerri is located was partially open for business.\n\nIn Anambra, the order was largely observed in Awka, the state capital as banks, markets including the popular Eke Awka, filling stations and others were closed while most roads were deserted.\n\nAlthough security personnel were sighted in some locations, most people stayed indoors either in obedience or out of fear of the unknown.\n\nIn Onitsha, markets, banks, filling stations and other business premises were closed. It was also the same in Ekwulobia and other urban centres in the state.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Tochukwu, told Daily Sun that the police provided adequate security to enable people go about their lawful businesses without fear.\n\n\u201cOur patrol vehicles are everywhere. Shops are a little bit open. Some that did not open were sitting in front of their shops. But our men are still patrolling around the cities.\u201d\n\n\u2022Masked men invade Enugu communities\n\nIn parts of Enugu-Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area, scores were injured, robbed and valuables destroyed as masked men on motorcycles invaded Ogrute, headquarters of Igbo-Eze North LGA smashed tables, looted shops and injured anyone on sight.\n\nAt Nkwo Aji community being a market day, the masked men descended on traders who came earlier to display their wares and attacked everyone with various weapons.\n\nPeople of the area who normally sell palmwine were counting losses as suspected IPOB members descended on the palm wine tappers/ sellers at their section smashed gallons of palm wine and beat up sellers as everyone ran for safety.\n\nAt the old Nkwo market, they also attacked a patent medicine store, broke the sliding glass shielding and scattered various drugs. A muslim faithful residing in the area popularly known as Momoh was also attacked as they damaged his motorcycle.\n\nThere were also reports of attack on hapless residents and shop owners in Isiugwu, Okpo, Imufu and Onicha-Enugu communities in the area.\n\nA businessman in Ogrute was also attacked in his farm at Imufu where they beat up the wife, struck the man with iron rod and collected the cash on him.\n\nTraders at the Nkwo Aji market were helpless as the market was deserted while those who normally come to purchase or sell perishable goods on the Nkwo market day were stranded.\n\n\u2022Abia, Nsukka grounded\n\nEconomic and social activities were paralyzed in Enugu as the entire Coal City witnessed the crippling of government and private businesses as civil servants (both federal and state) and public servants shun offices just as markets, banks, fuel stations, motor parks and even eateries did not open for business.\n\nSchools in the state were not left out as some of them, especially private ones, sent SMS to parents and guardians not to bring their children and wards to schools.\n\nNot even the confusion in the discordant voices in IPOB were able to avert the lockdown, as people who thought it would not work and came out early were disappointed as they waited in vain for vehicles, while those who drove returned when it was obvious they were the only people on the road.\n\nThe situation also affected the media as newspapers vanished from known newsstands. At the popular Obiagu where newspapers are sold, everywhere were deserted and children turned the streets to football field.\n\nA fruit seller who opened shop around 10am around Agric Bank bus stop said he did because his goods are perishables but noted that he was yet to make any sale by noon.\n\nA motorist, John Agu said: \u201cWe are happy that we are observing it. Though we did not go to work, it is still good because the Federal Government should know that we the Easterners are not happy at all. They should release our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, because he has not done anything wrong to deserve this insults he is getting from them.\u201d\n\nIn Aba, Abia State residents kept indoors and left their shops and business houses under lock and key. Streets and major access roads in the city centre, including the ever busy Milverton Avenue luxury/mini bus terminals for long distant travels were all deserted. Banks and markets such as Ekeoha Market (Shopping Centre), Ariaria international Market, Ahia Ohuru (Ngwa Road Market), Cemetery/Eziukwu Road Market, and others were shut down.\n\nHowever, no security agent was seen in all the locations our Correspondent visited, though they were on duty in their barracks and stations.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, an Aba resident, Mr Nnanna Ezeonyia, said he returned from a journey to hear there would be a sit-at-home but thought it would not be effective, but only came into the town to see that every where was deserted and looked like a ghost town.\n\nHe commended Igbo for bonding in one spirit in their quest for a better placement in Nigeria or the opportunity for a country of their own.\n\nEconomic activities were also paralysed in the university town of Nsukka and its environ.Banks closed their banking halls but allowed customers to use their Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) to withdrawals.\n\nIn major motor parks, passengers who wanted to travel to different locations like Abuja, Owerri, Anambra were stranded as drivers refused sell tickets or load their buses.

          "text": "\u2022It\u2019s the only way to remove him, Dickson insists\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll not resign, says party chair\n\n\u2022Senate, House caucuses support peace moves\n\n\u2022Party commences online membership registration\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAfter meeting for over 40 minutes behind closed doors on Monday, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors and the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, appeared to have reached a new deal as part of efforts to resolve the crisis which engulfed its leadership and ensure lasting peace in the main opposition party. The deal involved consideration of an early date for the party\u2019s national convention, as against the initial date of December 9.\n\nWith the new deal, widely believed to be in the overall interest of the party, THISDAY gathered that the December convention might be brought forward to either October or November.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in an earlier statement from his media office, said he would not succumb to pressure to resign. \u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign,\u201d he was quoted as saying. He added that he remained focused in his determination to move the party forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday, supported the move by the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) to resolve the crisis in the party. Abaribe and Elumelu denied reports that PDP members in the House had passed a resolution that Secondus should resign. The clarification was in reaction to a statement by a House of Representatives member from Rivers State, Kingsley Chinda, asking the party chairman to resign.\n\nOn his part, a former governor of Bayelsa State and member of the upper chamber, Senator Seriake Dickson, faulted calls for Secondus to resign, saying only the national convention is empowered to remove him.\n\nThe PDP governors had met for over seven hours between 10am and 5pm at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge. But about 4.10pm, Secondus was invited to the meeting, which held till 4.50pm\n\nAfter meeting with the PDP governors, Secondus was seen off by the governors of Sokoto and Akwa Ibom states, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Udom Emmanuel, respectively.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign\u201d, Secondus told reporters as he made to leave the venue.\n\nAlthough a deal to bring the convention backward had been struck, it was not clear if it included the eligibility of Secondus to contest. But the details of the deal\u2019s implementation would depend on the governors\u2019 meeting today with a committee set up by the BoT to interface.\n\nTambuwal told newsmen that the governors had resolved to back the party in its march towards greater unification.\n\nTambuwal, who is Chairman, PDP Governors Forum, said, \u201cWe have resolved to work together as a forum on the side of our party and the meeting continues tomorrow.\u201d He added, \u201cVery soon, Nigerians will know that our party is united.\u201d\n\nThe Monday meeting, held at the Akwa Ibom Liaison Office in Asokoro, Abuja, was attended by all the PDP governors, with the exception of Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.\n\nBefore the forum adjourned, Secondus, who made a brief appearance, said he would not resign from his position.\n\nA short statement from his media office, signed by Ike Abonye, said nothing so far warranted his resignation from the party\u2019s highest position. It said a tiny minority calling for the national chairman\u2019s resignation should come clean and tell other members his offence and why he should resign. Secondus promised to remain focussed and committed to the ideals of the party, which he swore to protect and defend upon his election as chairman 44 months ago.\n\nElumelu, who spoke on behalf of the House caucus said, in a statement, \u201cThe attention of the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has been drawn to false and misleading publications, purporting that the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives met online and resolved that the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, should resign.\n\n\u201cThe publication is, indeed, embarrassing to PDP lawmakers in the House of Representatives, as no such meeting took place. For the avoidance of doubt, no online meeting or any meeting in any form whatsoever of PDP members in the House of Representatives was held, to discuss, let alone arrive at any decision regarding the national chairman or any issue related to the disagreements in the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur caucus in the House of Representatives is fully aligned with the intervention and decisions of the Board of Trustees (BoT), the elders and leaders of our party, in finding solutions to the leadership challenges confronting our great party and we await the outcome of their intervention.\n\n\u201cWhile we caution those behind this false and misleading publication to retrace their steps and desist from such, we also urge our party leaders, critical stakeholders, PDP members, teeming supporters, and the general public to completely disregard the said publication.\n\n\u201cWe call on all PDP members to remain calm and focused as the elders and leaders of the party will come out with solutions at this critical time.\u201d\n\nSupporting the House caucus position, their counterparts in the Senate also backed the steps taken by the BoT to resolve the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe Senate PDP Caucus, on Monday, stated that it was in full support of whatever steps being taken by the party\u2019s BoT to resolve the issues at stake.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader, who doubles as Chairman of the PDP Senate Caucus, Abaribe, told THISDAY that though the PDP senators were on annual vacation, they backed the current move by the BoT to restore peace and sanity to the opposition party.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cWe are on vacation and support the BoT effort at getting a solution.\u201d\n\nChinda and Deputy Leader, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, had made their online resolution available to journalists yesterday, after they deliberated extensively but specifically on the current charge of \u201cinept leadership\u201d against Secondus.\n\nThey noted that while PDP and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipated vigorous and well-coordinated issue-based national opposition, preparations towards a national convention as well as the 2023 general election, confusion, finger-pointing and needless noise around the party\u2019s national headquarters had complicated the noble objectives and lofty ideals of the PDP and democratic opposition politics in Nigeria.\n\nThey alleged that Secondus seemed content with occupying the office and preoccupied with holding on to his position rather than preparing for the next elections. This, they claimed, explained why Secondus inexplicably continued to miss endless opportunities that ought to have been utilised for consolidating a viable opposition, skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition, and frustrating genuine party members across states, which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\nChinda and Onyema lamented that there was no clear roadmap, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the chairman, thus, the party was allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\nThey expressed concern that a further three months under the leadership of Secondus could do grave harm to the party and put its members in a precarious situation.\n\nThey, therefore, urged Secondus \u201cto consider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\nYesterday also, an unsigned statement by some PDP National Working Committee (NWC) members said, \u201cSequel to the meeting held on the 3rd of August 2021, at Legacy House, where members of the National Working Committee (NWC) sat and decided that a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) should be held on the 8th of August 2021 at Hilton to further deliberate on the matter bedevilling the party, the meeting held and extensively deliberated, nine members of the National Working Committee (NWC) agreed that the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\n\n\u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, six members voted that he should resign and three members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors forum, the BoT, the National Assembly caucus of both House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe call on all members of the party to remain calm as the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif; National Secretary, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha; National Financial Secretary, Abdulahi Maibasira; National Youth Leader, Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye; National Vice Chairman (SW), Taofiq Arapaja; National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa; National Vice Chairman (SS), Chief Dan Osi Orbih and National vice chairman (NC), Chief Theophilus Dakas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said those who voted for the resignation of Secondus were Nazif, Adamu Udeh-Okoye, Arapaja, Orbih and Odefa.\n\nBut National Legal Adviser of PDP, Emmanuel Enoidem, disclaimed the meeting of the said members of the NWC, describing it as illegal.\n\nIn a statement, Enoidem said, \u201cI just saw the above somewhere and as a committed member of this party and by the special grace of God, a member of NWC, I have the following points to make.\n\n\u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.Subsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of the NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\u201d\n\nEnoidem maintained that the power to remove any member of the NWC and, indeed, any national officer was reserved for the national convention, which was earlier slated for December 2021.\n\nSpeaking, too, Dickson, in a release issued on Monday, flayed the purported meeting by some members of the party\u2019s NWC, whom he said went outside the constitution of the party to convene a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the national chairman. He drew the attention of PDP leaders, members as well as Nigerians to the fact that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and did not represent a valid resolution or decision of the NWC known to the PDP constitution.\n\nDickson stated, \u201cThe purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP. It is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: three members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement, leaving out the majority of 13, who were not at the meeting and the chairman, who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore, it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crisis in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nWhile puncturing a purported statement by the PDP caucus in the House, which asked Secondus to resign, Dickson said, \u201cAll this is to create a media frenzy backed up with the sponsored demonstrations at the party secretariat on Monday, which are designed to force the chairman to resign in order to set up a caretaker committee, which is illegal.\n\n\u201cHappily, the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has issued a statement a short while ago that he will not resign. I support this decision fully as it is backed by the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, a vote of no confidence even by a duly constituted NWC or other organs of the party does not remove a Chairman. The chairman is voted for and can only be removed by the National Convention unless on his own volition, he chooses to resign.\u201d\n\nParty Commences Membership Registration\n\nMeanwhile, PDP has commenced online membership registration and revalidation in soe states. The states piloting the initiative in the first phase of the programme are Anambra, Osun, Ekiti, Edo, Adamawa, and Sokoto.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abuja while launching the project, Secondus stated that the \u201ccountry must at this point in time migrate from analogue to digital.\n\n\u201cData is the key to development; data is the key to proper planning and data is the way a country would be able to attract development from the global community. We as a party cannot do otherwise. We are operating in social media space, so, PDP cannot do without data.\u201d\n\nSecondus explained that by offering online registration, the party was providing Nigerians with a transparent platform to harness their democratic potential.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe project will deepen the process of membership registration and also deepen the process of democracy in attracting development. Usually, in the analogue time, they have to bring the register and if they don\u2019t like your face, you will not be a member. Some people will take the register away. All that has been eliminated.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the e-registration was a demonstration of PDP\u2019s readiness for the 2023 general election.

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said its proposed digital currency, known as e-Naira, will be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nIn a document obtained by THISDAY, which offered more insights into the digital money regime, especially the potential risks and mitigation measures, the apex bank said there would be a co-existence of traditional payment systems and the CBN Digital Currency (CBDC) to address interoperability risks that might be associated with the implementation.\n\nCBN said it would apply regulatory framework and compliance mechanisms to prevent disruptive competition for the electronic money.\n\nOn the associated cost and risk of deploying/on-boarding a new payment platform, the bank explained that medium to long- term pay-off in increased efficiency of operations was expected to offset initial outlay. It added that any risk of disintermediation would be addressed by the introduction of limits on the e-Naira holdings.\n\nThe document further stated that the introduction of the CBDC would, among other things, usher in new approaches to payment as well as bring about new bank and non- bank players in the financial system.\n\nThe digital currency regime would also introduce a new range of banking services and integration with new systems, providing new possibilities for the payment architecture.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the two-tiered model for CBDC would facilitate a public-private partnership arrangement whereby the CBN would design the e-Naira and distribute through regulated financial institutions, while the latter would in turn provide the digital cash to individuals and businesses.\n\nEssentially, under the e-Naira regime, individuals and businesses would be able to transfer value in real time through existing and future payment channels. People would also be able to transfer value in real time while offline to other persons and businesses.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the e-Naira would lower the cost of operations and cash management as well as improve visibility and insight of transaction date for financial institutions. It would also improve opportunities in the financial system, creating new business opportunities from emerging business models, financial products, and services.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele had during the recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting provided additional clarification on the e-Naira project. Emefiele said if \u201cyou have some naira in your account and you choose to convert part of your naira into a digital wallet by way of a digital currency, we will support that.\n\n\u201cIf, for instance, you have N10 million in your account. Of course, when this starts, the CBN will move some of the balances of banks with CBN to those banks in digital currency. So, you go to your bank, you have N10 million and you say you want to convert N2 million out of your N10 million into a digital currency. They will debit your account and move it to your wallet of N2 million digital currency, which you can spend across countries.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe think that this is a noble idea and we are not the first\u2026many other central banks are at advanced stages of revealing their own digital currencies. And our own digital currency, which is tagged e-Naira, will certainly come into operation, by the special grace of God, by October and we are working very hard for this.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said, \u201cWe believe that transactions will be cheaper and more efficient, as there will be less to complete.\u201d\n\nHe said as Nigeria moved to the digital economy, like the rest of the world, cash would not play in that space.\n\n\u201cTherefore, e-Naira, which will represent the digital equivalent of cash, will be used as the fiat currency to effect transactions,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of financial inclusion, we believe that with over 30 per cent of bankable adults still outside the financial system, the ability to have offline payment through our e-Naira initiative will bring\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rivers Govt, Not FG Should Collect VAT, Related Taxes, Court Rules",
          "text": "By Blessing Ibunge\n\nIn a landmark ruling, the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has declared that the Rivers State Government and not the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), an agency of the federal government, should collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in the state.\n\nPresided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam, the court also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the FIRS and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nJustice Pam made the assertion while delivering judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there was no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the federal government was limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains, which did not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lackedjurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nJustice Pam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the state government were issues of law that the court was constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it was entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it was the State and not FIRS that was constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the federal government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants were not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nAmong the reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, was a declaration that the constitutional power of the federal government to impose taxes and duties was only limited to the items listed in items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the second schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had also urged the court to declare that, by virtue of the provisions of items 7 and 8 of the Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule of the constitution, the power of the federal government to delegate the collection of taxes can only be exercised by the State government or other authority of the state and no other person.\n\nThe State government had further asked the court to declare that all statutory provisions made or purportedly made in the exercise of the legislative powers of the federal government, which contained provisions that were inconsistent with or in excess of the powers to impose tax and duties, as prescribed by items 58 and 59 of the Part I of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution, or inconsistent with the power to delegate the duty of collection of taxes, as contained in items 7 and 8 of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Constitution, were unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nLead counsel for the Rivers State Government, Donald Chika Denwigwe (SAN), who spoke to journalists after the court session, explained that the case was all about the interpretation of the constitution as regards the authority of the government at the state and federal levels to collect certain revenue particularly, VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, during the determination of the matter, some issues of law were thrown up like, whether or not the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the determination of some issues.\n\n\u201cThe court noted that the application is like asking the Federal High Court to transfer the entire case to the Court of Appeal. In which case, if the court so decides, there will be nothing left to refer back to the Federal High Court as required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nAccording to Denwigwe, the court refused that prayer and decided that the case was in its proper place before the Federal High Court and to determine it.\n\nDonald Chika Denwigwe, SAN, lead counsel to Government of Rivers State and Ken C.O. Njemanze, SAN, briefing journalists after the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt on Monday declared FIRS collection of Value Added Tax in Rivers State unconstitutional.\n\nOn the implication of the judgement, Denwigwe said it was now, unlawful for such taxes as VAT in Rivers State to be collected by any agency of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIn a summary, it is a determination that it is wrong for the federal government to be collecting taxes, which are constitutionally reserved for the state governments to collect. The implication of the judgement is that the government (federal and state) as an authority under the constitution, should be advised by the judgement, that it is the duty of all government authorities to comply with and obey the law so long as the court has interpreted it and said what that law is.\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the issue of Value Added Tax (VAT) in the territory of Rivers State and Personal Income Tax should be reserved for the government of Rivers State.\u201d\n\nCounsel to FIRS, O.C. Eyibo said he would study the judgment and advise his client.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the first detection of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has reached pandemic proportions, affecting students and schooling at all levels.\n\nIn a March 2021 press release, the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) claimed that the temporary closure of educational institutions affected over 168 million children worldwide who stayed home as countries worked to flatten the curve.\n\nConsequently, schools transited to online learning.\n\nInternational human rights organisation, Amnesty International, reported that students were cut off from school5 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit South Africa, leaving hundreds and thousands of students without access to education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Africa has a 62% Internet penetration rate, which translates to 36.54 million Internet users with a 3.1% year-on-year (YoY) increase as of 2020. And WhatsApp is the country\u2019s most popular social media platform.\n\nAccording to a social media report (PDF) by Global Wellbeing Index (GWI), 96% of South African Internet users use WhatsApp. Responding to the growing number of users, Dacod Magagula (CEO) and Tao Boyle (COO) founded FoondaMate, a WhatsApp API.\n\nStudents use FoondaMate to download research papers, search concepts, define words, and do simple mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cWe launched FoondaMate in South Africa in August 2020 after realising that hundreds of thousands of students in our country were unable to learn because schools were closed due to lockdowns and the unavailability of appropriate technology products,\u201d Boyle explains.\n\n\u201cSo, we developed a method for students to study online using WhatsApp,\u201d Magagula adds.\n\nWhy FoondaMate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoondaMate co-founders from L-R: (Tao Boyle, Dacod Magagula); Source: Supplied\n\nGrowing up outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, South Africa, Magagula says he was the only student in his high school class with access to a computer. His visits to local Internet cafes to download study material significantly impacted his life. He was the first student from his school to get into the University of Cape Town.\n\n\u201cPartly, this success can be attributed to the availability of resources I was exposed to,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, that was not the case for his co-founder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyle attended a private high school in Cape Town with computers, but she faced education inequality in her third year at the University of Cape Town.\n\n\u201cI first encountered the issue of educational inequality during my third-year internship at Funda Wande, an NGO,\u201d she begins.\n\nHer internship assignment required her to collect data on textbook spending in South Africa. This proved to be a turning point for her.\n\n\u201cThis experience really got me thinking about scalable ways to address education inequality,\u201d she adds.\n\nBoyle got to know Magagula through a friend. They conversed about educational inequality, and their exchanges resulted in the creation of FoondaMate.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder and I met at the university, and the stark differences in our high school experience were a huge eye-opener for me,\u201d Boyle reveals.\n\n\u201cI always wished I could share resources with more students in the community. Therefore, when WhatsApp opened its API in 2020, my co-founder and I realised that my wish could become a reality. And there we started FoondaMate,\u201d Magagula says.\n\nUsing FoondaMate on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOO, Tao Boyle; Source: Supplied\n\nThe name, FoondaMate is derived from siSwati, and translates to \u201cstudy buddy.\u201d Describing the WhatsApp API, Boyle says it\u2019s like \u201cmessaging a very knowledgeable friend.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate helps students with limited Internet access to study online using localised chatbots.\n\nTo access study materials, search the web, or download practice questions and memos, click this link, and you\u2019ll see a WhatsApp web-like interface on your screen asking you to send \u2018hello\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the green \u201cGo to Chat\u201d button and click on \u201cOpen WhatsApp\u201d if you have WhatsApp installed on your device. You will be redirected to chat with Nelson, a chatbot.\n\nFoondaMate wants students to succeed irrespective of the resources available in their schools or homes. They believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not.\n\nThe edtech startup plans to change this by making opportunities available to everyone by using a platform most students with a smartphone already have.\n\nConsidering the cost of traditional educational materials like textbooks and group tutoring in South Africa, FoondaMate helps save costs by offering those services on WhatsApp.\n\nSome students with limited internal memory on their smartphones can\u2019t download the apps that give them access to online resources. So FoondaMate uses WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger already installed on users\u2019 phones to help them study.\n\nStriking growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO, Dacod Magagula; Source: Supplied\n\nSpeaking about their growth, Boyle says, \u201cWe have seen a 64% increase in signups month-on-month from May to June 2021, a 66% increase in Monthly Active Users (MAU) month-on-month from May to June 2021, and we just hit 138,870 signups for FoondaMate, which is a pre-revenue with initial pilot revenue to prove our business model.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate also generates revenue through collaborations with financial institutions and post-secondary educational institutions. Partnering with financial institutions helps provide users with sponsored information on financial literacy while promoting its partners\u2019 relevant product offerings.\n\nThis helps users, many of whom are underprivileged, develop critical financial literacy skills while also expanding market opportunities for partners.\n\n\u201cFor post-secondary educational institutions, we facilitate applications via FoondaMate, enabling them to increase the number of applicants to their programmes,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nHere, the critical value is their ability to connect these educational institutions with brilliant and engaged students who, otherwise, might not know about the institutions\u2019 programmes.\n\nFrom South Africa to the World\n\nLike the Kenyan edtech startup, M-Lugha, helping Kenyans learn in their native language, FoondaMate engages its users in their indigenous languages.\n\nBoyle says, \u201cmaking resources available in native languages creates a unique form of user delight that affirms its users while providing them with access to education.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate is available in ten African languages. However, they are faced with a challenge.\n\n\u201cBuilding FoondaMate is challenging because we are not only building a technology but also introducing it to communities,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty tricky because the majority of their users have never interacted with a chatbot before. So, ensuring that users understand they are not chatting with a human is tough.\n\n\u201cWe had users who wanted to become friends with Nelson, the chatbot, asking to meet up or have phone calls. That indeed is a challenge,\u201d Magaluga reveals.\n\n\u201cWe have had to change our approach to make sure students actually understand that they are interacting with a bot so that they are not disappointed when they can\u2019t hang out with their new friend,\u201d Boyle expounds.\n\nHowever, the edtech startup has recorded massive success since its launch in August 2020.\n\nFoondaMate has reached over 130,000 students within Africa, Latin America, and Asia, who have downloaded over 1.8 million practice questions.\n\nAlthough these questions are the same across all countries, the team is working on making them region-specific.\n\nThough most users are from South Africa, people in other African countries like Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, Nigeria, Malawi, and Kenya also use FoondaMate.\n\nIn Latin American, FoondaMate\u2019s users come from Colombia and Brazil, while users in Asia are from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. And FoondaMate is working on expanding to these areas.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to double down on our growth in Latin America and Asia. We are seeing increasing interest in these regions, with requests to launch in India and Brazil, as well as customise the product for these regions,\u201d she says\n\nIn Africa, fintech startups continue to dominate the tech space and attract VC funding, and the co-founders believe that African edtech startups are overlooked. However, they also think that FoondaMate is paving the way in the tech space.\n\n\u201cWith Africa being the continent with the world\u2019s youngest population, and quickly growing, there is a massive demand for education here, and our growth really shows this,\u201d Boyle concludes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based Business to Business (B2B) eCommerce startup, Omnibiz has announced securing $3million in a seed round. It plans to expand into other cities in West Africa and participate in Seed Stars\u2019 accelerator program.\n\nLed by V&R Africa, Timon Capital and Tangerine Insurance, this seed round also saw investments from Launch Africa, Sunu Capital, Musha Ventures, Rising Tide Africa, and LoftyInc. Swiss-based emerging markets investment company, Seed Stars also joined the round.\n\nFounded by Deepankar Rustagi \u2014 CEO \u2014 in 2019, Omnibiz connects manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) with local retailers using a mobile app, WhatsApp and a phone number.\n\nOmnibiz is not Rustagi\u2019s first attempt at building a business in Africa, having previously founded VConnect, which allowed people to find local professionals. This experience, he says, would come in handy as he pilots the affairs at Omnibiz.\n\n\u201cWe knew about small businesses and what sort of technology they like. That was our specialisation, but our business model didn\u2019t work. But in this case (Omnibiz), the monetisation works on our platform, and there\u2019s money to be made for the small business. We\u2019ve been growing 30% month-on-month for the last 12 months,\u201d he said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\neCommerce in Africa has seen massive growth, driven in part by increasing internet and smartphone penetration. However, this growth has happened mainly in the B2C space. However, recently, startups have sprung up looking to digitise the retail process for B2B. Twiga, Trade Depot, and MaxAB are just a few of these startups.\n\nOmnibiz operates an asset-light model that Rustagi believes will accelerate its growth. \u201cI think scaling in one city with assets is not that difficult. But if you have to scale in 20, 24 cities in a country like Nigeria or Ghana, or Ivory Coast or East Africa, the investment required will be very high, so we think without significant investment in assets, we will be able to scale much faster.\n\n\u201cAnd since we took the tech-first approach, we have good control over the business. I believe we\u2019re in the right space and the right time with the right model.\u201d\n\nTheir investors share this optimism with Raj Kulasingam and Vishar Agarwal of V&R Africa, saying in a statement, \u201cI think Omnibiz will be the role model for B2B retail in Africa and can scale well into other emerging markets. We are excited and happy to be supporting Omnibiz in all ways beyond just providing capital.\u201d\n\nWith this new investment, the startup plans to expand its product categories to include alcoholic beverages and OTC pharmaceutical products while entering Ghana and Ivory Coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nChekkit\u2019s $500k pre-seed\n\nBetter investment decisions?\n\nMoove\u2019s $23m Series A\n\nChekkit raises $500k pre-seed to combat fake consumer drugs and goods\n\nChekkit Team\n\n\n\nChekkit, a Nigeria-based anti-counterfeiting startup, has announced a $500k pre-seed. It was launched in 2018 as the founders hoped to combat the sale of fake drugs and consumer goods. Some investors in the round include Launch Africa and Japan Strategic Capital.\n\nCo-founded by Dare Odumade (CEO) and Oluwatosin Adelowo (CMO), the startup is a subsidiary of Chekkit Technologies. It helps consumers determine the authenticity of a product using their mobile phones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a problem. The sale of fake drugs and consumer goods thrives in Africa, primarily because of lax regulatory oversight in the pharmaceutical and food industry.\n\nBetween November 2008 and February 2009, a tragedy hit Nigeria as 84 children died after being given a supposed teething drug containing harmful chemical substances.\n\nAlthough measures \u2014 like the NAFDAC Product Registration Verify \u2014 have been put in place to reduce these occurrences, fake consumer goods still saturate the market. This is due to cheap products and low awareness of verification processes for most people in low-income areas.\n\nRemember this? Nigerian deep tech startup, RxAll is looking to squash the $30 billion global fake drug industry\n\nBefore this funding, Chekkit relied on grants. But with this pre-seed, the startup is looking to expand its team and build technological infrastructure.\n\nYou can read more about Chekkit\u2019s pre-seed here.\n\nTapping global investment currents\n\nPartnership\n\n\n\nWhat does a partnership between a Nigeria-based investment-tech startup and a global investment social network platform spell for investors? I smell access to more international stocks, and consequently, better investment decisions.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Chaka, a Nigerian investment startup, which enables local investors to access foreign stocks, has announced its partnership with TradingView.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? With this partnership, Chaka is now a local, licenced broker with the TradingView investment platform.\n\nThis means users with a brokerage account on Chaka can now track and access global investment opportunities, track and place a trade directly on world trading charts, communicate with world trade markets, and access analytical investment tools.\n\nRecall that Chaka is also the first digital investment platform to secure Nigeria\u2019s new digital sub-broker licence. It looks like it\u2019s raining first-mover advantage this year, as this partnership also makes them the first African stockbroker for TradingView.\n\nA visit to TradingView\u2019s platform revealed that they offer cryptocurrency trading. Does this mean that, by extension, Chaka users can also buy and/or trade cryptocurrency? Highly unlikely, taking into account current CBN regulations and SEC\u2019s non-committal stance.\n\nWell, with this partnership, Chaka\u2019s users may now be able to make better investment decisions and access a wide range of real-time, global trading options.\n\nMoove announces $23m Series A to scale across Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoove\u2019s founders, Jide Odunsi and Ladi Delano\n\nAnother rain of funds? Africa-focused mobility financing startup, Moove, has announced closing a $23m Series A. This funding was led by Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital and saw participation from Esmo Asset Management \u2014 previous lenders \u2014 and Kepple Africa Ventures, among others.\n\nFirst time raising? It\u2019s a Series A, so, definitely not their first time. The platform initially raised a $5.2m seed round in 2020 and $40m in debt financing, bringing its total funding to $68.2m.\n\nOkay, why so much funds? Well, Moove is a revenue-based vehicle financing company that helps drivers on ride-hailing platforms purchase new cars, and pay in instalments. It is currently Uber\u2019s exclusive vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWith this raise, Moove is looking to scale across Africa, create access to electric vehicles for drivers, hire more female drivers, and create wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts.\n\nMore information about Moove\u2019s Series A in this article: Nigeria-based mobility fintech, Moove raises $23 million Series A\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nHow to Think: The Skill You\u2019ve Never Been Taught.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State-Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project has condemned a viral video of a protest by some persons purported to be living around the project catchment area of Gapiona, noting that claims in the said video were falsely represented.\n\nCommunication Officer, Edo NEWMAP, Ivy Adodo, in a statement, noted that \u201cthe viral video was recorded last year and was used as a political tool/campaign against the Government at the peak of the governorship election of 2020 by the proponents of the said video sometime in June 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adodo, \u201cWhile most of the claims in the said video were falsely represented, as at today every person whose property has been affected has been fully paid by the Government of Edo State that is responsible for the payment of compensation and not the World Bank as also erroneously conveyed by the proponent of the video.\n\n\u201cThe project is by the Edo State Government and not a World Bank project as erroneously conveyed in the said video. Furthermore, the Gapiona flood Project was initiated at the instance of the State Government and not the other way.\n\n\u201cThe Gapiona erosion control project consists of various sub-catchments and communities in the catchment area including but not limited to Gapiona, Ruben Agho, Ebo, Ogumwenyin, Ugieokuin, and several other areas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further reads: \u201cThe Proposed Pond 1 area of the current Gapiona flood alleviation project is the lowest point in the whole catchment and naturally the place for settlement of the whole flood within the area. Residents in Gapiona area have lived with the erosion problem for over 20 years, this has led to many residents fleeing their homes while majority of the access roads linking the area has been rendered impassable.\n\n\u201cThe intense flooding being experienced in the area in recent times is due to the impact of climate change resulting from high runoff and higher intensity of rainfall and the indiscriminate fencing and obstruction of waterways by residence.\n\n\u201cThis very problem is the reason for the prioritization of this project by the state government and the reason for its intervention through Edo State NEWMAP.\u201d\n\nNoting the government\u2019s commitment to tackle the problem of flooding in Edo communities and alleviate the sufferings of the people, Adodo stated: \u201cIt, therefore, may not be charitable if NEWMAP, an intervention project is now erroneously being held responsible for the flooding of homes within this area, which is a very unfortunate and regrettable event.\n\n\u201cThe Engineering Design being implemented by the State Government as cleared was designed by the number 1 rated Engineering design firm in Africa, reviewed by the Federal Project Management Unit of NEWMAP, through a renowned Engineering design firm and finally cleared by a combined team of Engineers from the FAO and the World bank.\n\n\u201cThe government is implementing a world class design through one of the best construction companies in Nigeria also approved by the World Bank.\n\n\u201cNEWMAP\u2019s intervention in the area has brought succor to residents in the sections where work has been completed.\n\n\u201cEdo State NEWMAP has worked at 15 locations/sites and has successfully completed six other flood and gully erosion control projects (Edo College, Queen Ede, Ekehuan, all in Benin City; Oshiobugie in Auchi, Ibore and Ewu both in Esan Central LGA) in Edo state in line with best global practices and these communities are now better off.\n\n\u201cThese are all there for verification. The completed work will be to the benefit of all residents in the catchment area in the long run.\u201d\n\nAccording to Edo NEWMAP, \u201cIt may interest you to note that there are 23 participating States in Nigeria and the last two evaluation and ratings of performance, Edo State came tops under the leadership of the Project Coordinator, Dr. Tom Obaseki.\n\n\u201cTrying to malign his professionalism and personality is an exercise in futility. While the project is concerned with the current challenges being faced by the residents, we want to assure that every step is being taken to accelerate the process of implementation. We appeal to residents, particularly those within the Pond1 area for their patience as the project which is in progress is in the advanced stages of completion.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Governor Aminu Masari has failed to conduct local government council elections in Katsina State since he became governor in 2015, despite the Supreme Court three months ago upholding the voiding of his dissolution of the last elected councils in the state.\n\nThe Supreme Court judgment in May ended almost six years of legal battle by the elected council officials that Mr Masari illegally removed following his assumption of office on May 29, 2015.\n\nThe officials headed to the courts in July that year and won at the high court and at the Court of Appeal, where the state government had sought to overturn the judgment of the lower court.\n\nBefore the apex court\u2019s verdict settled the matter in May, Mr Masari had described the prolonged litigation as the obstacle to the conduct of local government elections in the state. He promised to conduct the elections within three months of the decision of the apex court.\n\nAll the while, the governor had handed the administration of the councils to appointed caretaker committees and directors of personnel management, a practice the Supreme Court has described as unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nIn June, a month after the verdict of the apex court was given again in favour of the sacked council officials, the governor again reiterated his commitment to conducting the elections.\n\nAccording to Mr Masari, the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in the state would respect the decision of the Supreme Court, stressing, \u201cWe are seventy per cent ready to conduct the elections in all the 34 local government areas in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the state government had rehabilitated the State Independent Electoral Commission, while new vehicles had been procured.\n\nBut 58 days after the second declaration, elections for the chairpersons and councillors are yet to be conducted in the 34 local government areas of the state.\n\nBackground\n\nBarely a month after he was first sworn in six years ago, Mr. Masari sacked the 34 local government council chairpersons and their councillors for \u201cfinancial misappropriation of Council funds.\u201d\n\nThe sacked local government council officials, all from the former ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ran to court to challenge their sack.\n\nThe legal journey that started in Katsina and went through Kaduna terminated in Abuja when the Supreme Court in May this year, in a unanimous judgment, declared the sack of the council officials as \u201cillegal, unconstitutional, null and void.\u201d\n\nThe court said the sacking breached section 7 (1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe court therefore ordered the Katsina State government to pay the acked officials their entitlements for the remainder of their tenure, in suit SC 244/218 brought by Abubakar Ibrahim Yantaba and others against the Governor of Katsina State, Mr Masari.\n\nAfter the court verdict, the PDP chairperson in the state, Salisu Majigiri, said they would ensure that the state government complies with the verdict\n\n\u201cWe thank God almighty for giving us the judgment and also the Supreme Court for giving consequential order so that enforcement can be done from now to August 2021.\n\n\u201cWe thank the teeming members of Katsina State PDP and of course the elected local government officials who have spent six years waiting for Supreme Court to deliver this judgment.\u201d\n\nA few days later, the state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Ahmad Marzuq, told journalists that the state government had started paying the sacked officials their entitlements.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said the state government being a law-abiding entity had no reason to disobey a decision of the highest court in the land.\n\nAccording to him, up to 80 per cent of those owed had been settled.\n\nAbuse of democracy\n\nSpeaking with PREMIUM TIMES, Kabir Yandaki, the head of Department of Political Science at the Ummaru Musa Yar\u2019adu\u2019a University, Katsina, described the failure of the state government to conduct the elections as a threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cThe failure of Katsina State government to conduct local government elections after three months of Supreme Court verdict has glaringly revealed the nature and character of how democracy is being weakened, punctuated and abused by the political class, not only in Katsina State, but also Nigeria in general.\n\n\u201cYou see, it is really unbecoming of a democracy which is over two decades old to be behaving as such. It is a gross abuse of the rule of law for Katsina State to keep deaf ears to a verdict of the highest court in the land. There is no excuse for that.\u201d\n\nMr Yandaki accused state governors across Nigeria of deliberately refusing to conduct LG elections because they think they are above the law of the land.\n\nThe Chairman of the Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in the state, Abdurahman Dutsin Ma, said by not conducting the elections, Mr Masari has failed to fulfill a part of his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cThe delay is raising concerns. Firstly, conducting local government elections and granting autonomy to local government councils were part of Governor Masari\u2019s promises to the people of Katsina State and that promise is still hanging on his neck.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the reason adduced for the delay in conducting the election has been over now. So, there is no more reason for foot-dragging.\u201d\n\nMr Dutsin Ma also highlighted the importance of a strong local government institution in the development of society.\n\n\u201cElected councils have so many advantages and of most important now, is they can minimise insecurity in the society. Government will be taken closer to the people. There will be presence of government up to wards level and peoples\u2019 needs can easily be assessed and quickly addressed. Parts of the burden on the state can also be shelved to the local government councils. Katsina State needs autonomous and democratically elected local government councils,\u201d he added.\n\nYahuza Ahmed, a public affairs analyst, also faulted the state government for not conducting the elections.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand the value of local government councils in governance. They are the primary source of governance because that is where the common man benefits from the dividend of democracy. So it is very important when they function and we know they cannot function well when they are not elected chairmen and councillors.\n\nHe said Governor Masari\u2019s failure to conduct the elections has many implications.\n\n\u201cIt has implication on governance, it has implication on the future of democracy, it has implication related to security, stability, and economic and social well being of the people. It\u2019s important for Masari to fulfill this promise and respect the court.\u201d\n\nGovernment responds\n\nThe governor\u2019s Special Assistant on Broadcast Media, Murtala Kafur, said the state government was preparing for the elections.\n\n\u201cI have heard the complaints too. But you cannot just wake up to conduct elections for 34 local government areas; you need preparations. That include meeting with stakeholders and covering the financial aspect. But as I am speaking to you, His Excellency is ready to conduct the election.\u201d\n\nAsked why the delay, Mr Kafur said the court issue and financial situation of the local government areas made it impossible for the state government to go ahead with the elections.\n\nHe stressed that preparations were in top gear to fulfill the promise made by the governor.\n\nThe known telephone numbers of the Chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission, Ibrahim Bako, were not going through as of the time of this report and other efforts made to speak with him for this story did not succeed.\n\nBut at a press briefing three weeks ago, Mr Bako said the Commission was ready to conduct the elections.\n\n\u201cWe are now very ready, only remaining a meeting with the stakeholders and relevant authorities as well as confirmations from the state House of Assembly,\u201d he said at the event.\n\n\u201cI cannot give you exact date when the elections will hold, but all I can tell you is that we are prepared; we are ready to conduct the elections.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, an election must have a timetable and election date, and until that is ready, we have to wait,\u201d Mr Bako said.",

It was amazing that a top government official comes out to say that the Fulani militias are invisible. How? Are they spirits? Why is the government not going after these Fulani militias and bandits that are terrorising the entire country and terrorising my state?\n\n\u201cJust two days ago, two humanitarian workers were gunned down in my own village by these Fulani militias and their phones taken away.

I think four of our men lost their lives in the attack.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m telling you is unofficial report. The PPRO will brief soonest. It was terrible; these guys (hoodlums) came in seven vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere were speculations that the hoodlums came for reprisal following the early morning killing of two persons by unidentified soldiers (joint patrol team) in Nnewi. I didn\u2019t know about that incident until we were attacked at the Area Command this (Monday) afternoon.\u201d\n\nAnother source confirmed that the gunmen came in seven vehicles and overpowered the police personnel on duty, carted away arms and ammunition.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe gunmen overpowered the police and carted away their arms. By the time reinforcement from the Navy came, the attackers had left, though they were pursued to no avail.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident to our correspondent in a text message.\n\nStill in Anambra, apart from the four cops that were said to have been killed by hoodlums, two persons were shot dead in Nnewi, while three buses were set ablaze in the area.\n\nA Toyota Camry was seen abandoned on a street near the scene of the crime.\n\nA source said the car was abandoned when the occupant saw that the hoodlums were advancing towards his direction.\n\n\u201cThey were singing and shouting, \u2018Today is sit-at-home. Anything sighted, even if it\u2019s a fly must be destroyed\u2019. There were gunshots around Izuchukwu Park junction around 6am.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident, adding that police operatives had been deployed to the scene.\n\nTravellers burnt as hoodlums raze five vehicles in Imo attack\n\nAlso, five vehicles; three Hummer buses belonging to Libra and Okey Transport companies, a Sienna, and a Highlander SUV were set ablaze along the Owerri-Umuahia Road, which was later deserted by motorists.\n\nScores of the occupants, who were travelling to Lagos and others returning to Imo State from Lagos, escaped with some carrying bullet injuries.\n\nIt was learnt that drivers of the commercial vehicles were seriously hit by the attackers.\n\nThe incident occurred along the Owerri-Umuahia Road, which was later deserted by motorists.\n\nOne of the charred remains of the victims was seen in one of the buses where two persons were suspected to have died.\n\nAn elderly man, Pa Johnson, whose house is opposite the scene, told The PUNCH that the incident happened around 4:30am.\n\nThe octogenarian disclosed that they were jolted by the deafening sound of intermittent gunshots.

I think four of our men lost their lives in the attack.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m telling you is unofficial report. The PPRO will brief soonest. It was terrible; these guys (hoodlums) came in seven vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere were speculations that the hoodlums came for reprisal following the early morning killing of two persons by unidentified soldiers (joint patrol team) in Nnewi. I didn\u2019t know about that incident until we were attacked at the Area Command this (Monday) afternoon.\u201d\n\nAnother source confirmed that the gunmen came in seven vehicles and overpowered the police personnel on duty, carted away arms and ammunition.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe gunmen overpowered the police and carted away their arms. By the time reinforcement from the Navy came, the attackers had left, though they were pursued to no avail.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident to our correspondent in a text message.\n\nStill in Anambra, apart from the four cops that were said to have been killed by hoodlums, two persons were shot dead in Nnewi, while three buses were set ablaze in the area.\n\nA Toyota Camry was seen abandoned on a street near the scene of the crime.\n\nA source said the car was abandoned when the occupant saw that the hoodlums were advancing towards his direction.\n\n\u201cThey were singing and shouting, \u2018Today is sit-at-home. Anything sighted, even if it\u2019s a fly must be destroyed\u2019. There were gunshots around Izuchukwu Park junction around 6am.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident, adding that police operatives had been deployed to the scene.\n\nTravellers burnt as hoodlums raze five vehicles in Imo attack\n\nAlso, five vehicles; three Hummer buses belonging to Libra and Okey Transport companies, a Sienna, and a Highlander SUV were set ablaze along the Owerri-Umuahia Road, which was later deserted by motorists.\n\nScores of the occupants, who were travelling to Lagos and others returning to Imo State from Lagos, escaped with some carrying bullet injuries.\n\nIt was learnt that drivers of the commercial vehicles were seriously hit by the attackers.\n\nThe incident occurred along the Owerri-Umuahia Road, which was later deserted by motorists.\n\nOne of the charred remains of the victims was seen in one of the buses where two persons were suspected to have died.\n\nAn elderly man, Pa Johnson, whose house is opposite the scene, told The PUNCH that the incident happened around 4:30am.\n\nThe octogenarian disclosed that they were jolted by the deafening sound of intermittent gunshots.

It also said Messi would have medical tests on Tuesday, and that a news conference to mark his arrival was likely on Wednesday.\n\nMany Barcelona fans were distraught at the end of Messi\u2019s glittering, trophy-laden career at the club he joined as a schoolboy.\n\nBut the arrival of Barcelona\u2019s all-time record scorer with 682 goals will boost PSG\u2019s ambitions to win the Champions League for the first time.\n\nMessi won four Champions League titles while at Barcelona, as well as 10 La Liga titles.\n\nPSG AMBITIONS\n\nMessi is the latest big-name arrival at PSG on a free transfer this summer after coach Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side snapped up Spanish defender Sergio Ramos after he left Real Madrid.\n\nDutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum also joined after running down his contract with Liverpool.\n\nItaly\u2019s Euro 2020-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has also joined after his contract with AC Milan ran out.\n\nMoroccan fullback Achraf Hakimi joined from Inter Milan for a reported 60 million euros ($70 million).\n\nThe arrival of Messi, whose last contract with Barcelona was worth a total of 555 million euros and reported to be the most lucrative in world sport, is also set to provoke a renewed new debate about UEFA\u2019s financial fair play rules.\n\nThe rules were first introduced in 2009 to restrict some of the worst excesses of the game but have been criticised by some leading figures for being ineffective.\n\nThe arrival of Messi, who has 245 million followers on Instagram and is Barcelona\u2019s most decorated player of all time, is also welcome news for France\u2019s Ligue 1, embroiled in a crisis over TV rights.",

They flew there quietly with their private jets. The party was organised and held in secret to keep it away from prying eyes,\u201d a source stated.\n\n\u201cThose in attendance included the usual suspects; Dangote, Nduka Obaigbena, Herbert Wigwe, Tony Elumelu and Adesola Adeduntan and so on,\u201d the source added.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had last week sent a congratulatory letter to Emefiele, having celebrated his birthday on August 4.\n\nEmefiele served as the governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank since June 3, 2014.\n\nIn March 2016, Emefiele was appointed first by President Goodluck Jonathan and was reappointed to the position in May 2019 by Buhari, shortly before the expiration of his first tenure.\n\nUnder Emefiele, Nigeria has experienced rising inflation, jumping to 17.33 percent at the end of February 2021 from 16.47 percent in January 2021, according to the governor himself.\n\nThe governor had also been accused of engaging in underhand dealings and fraudulent practices which continued to frustrate the activities of the bank and the country\u2019s banking sector.\n\nSaharaReporters in 2016 for instance obtained a list of at least 91 people tied to influential or highly placed Nigerians who were at that time offered juicy appointments by the CBN under Emefiele.\n\nThe list of beneficiaries of the CBN\u2019s job largesse had included a daughter of former Vice President Abubakar Atiku, a son of Mamman Daura, a nephew of President Buhari and one of the closest members of the president\u2019s inner circle, a son of the then Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, a daughter of former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Na\u2019aba, also daughter of former Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase, and at least 86 others.",

          "text": "Will National Chairman Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Prince Uche Secondus go the way of sacked Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC)?\n\nThis is one question that will be answered in the fullness of time as the leadership crisis facing the opposition PDP deepened Monday with some stakeholders calling for the sack of the embattled party chair.\n\nHow Oshiomhole was booted out\n\nAt the height of the APC crises, some party chieftains insisted Oshiomhole must go if the party was to make any reasonable inroad and shore up its support base following a string of electoral losses it suffered under his leadership.\n\nFor instance, it is on record that the loss suffered by the APC in Zamfara state following protracted rift between the Abdulaziz Yari-led faction and that led by Senator Kabiru Marafa, was blamed on Oshiomhole\u2019s handling of the row.\n\nThe result was that the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the PDP candidate, Muhammad Bello Matawalle as the duly elected governor.\n\nMatawalle has since defected to the APC.\n\nSimilarly, the APC National Working Committee (NWC) under Oshiomhole was also faulted for \u2018pushing\u2019 Edo state Governor Godwin Obaseki out of the party, with the governor later joining the PDP.\n\nWith these and other pockets of crises within some chapters of the party, the National Executive Council (NEC) met and dissolved the party leadership under the former Edo state governor.\n\nSecondus\u2019 travails\n\nSimilar scenarios are playing out in PDP as the crises get messier Monday with 6 out of the 18-member NWC signed in support of the compulsory resignation of the party chair, Prince Scondus.\n\nAt a meeting late Sunday night in Abuja, the six NWC members agreed that \u201cSecondus has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\u201d\n\nMaking their position known in an unsigned statement, they said: \u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, 6 members voted that he should resign and 3 members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors\u2019 forum, the BOT, the national assembly caucus of both House of Reps and the Senate.\u201d\n\nThey called on all members of the party to remain calm \u201cas the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Senator Suleiman Nazif \u2013 deputy national chairman (North), Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri \u2013 National Secretary, Alhaji Mai Adamu Mustapha \u2013 National Auditor, Abdulahi Maibasira \u2013 National Financial Secretary, Rt. Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye \u2013 National Youth Leader, Ambassador Taofiq Arapaja \u2013 National Vice Chairman (SW), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dan Osi Orbih -National Vice Chairman (SS) and Chief Theophilus Dakas National Vice Chairman (NC).\n\n\u201cThose who voted in favour that Prince Uche Secondus should resign were: Senator Suleiman Nazif \u2013 Deputy National Chairman (N). Alhaji Mai Adamu Mustapher -National Auditor, Rt. Hon. S.K.E Udeh- Okoye, Ambassador Taofiq Arapaja \u2013 National Vice Chairman (SW), Chief Dan Orbih National Vice Chairman (SS) and Chief Dr. Ali Odefa National Vice Chairman (SE),\u201d the statement further said.\n\nWhen contacted, a few NWC members, who attended the meeting and spoke to Blueprint under anonymity confirmed the statement.\n\nYouth group\n\nSimilarly, a group \u2013 Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups -protested Monday in Abuja and called for Secondus\u2019 removal.\n\nLeader of the group, Mr Tamunotonye Inioribo, while addressing journalists Monday in Abuja, said the protest was organised by a coalition of different PDP support groups dissatisfied with the leadership of Secondus.\n\nInioribo who accused Secondus of polarising the party for his own selfish interest, said, \u201cUnder Secondus, the PDP Governors Forum, National Working Committee and other organs are divided.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were seen carrying placards with different inscriptions such as \u201cSecondus Must Go\u201d, \u201cwe have lost confidence in your chairmanship\u201d, \u201cwe cannot afford to lose more governors\u201d among others.\n\nReps too\u2026\n\nAlso, the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, asked the party chair to quit office so the party could commence preparation ahead 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nin a statement jointly signed by its leader, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, and his deputy, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, the lawmakers said Secondus should \u201cconsider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt also appealed to the party\u2019s BOT and the Governors Forum to ensure immediate and firm resolution of current challenges so as to enable a \u201cre-engineering, re-focusing process that would restore party members and millions of other Nigerians\u2019 hope and confidence in the PDP as an alternative to the current dysfunctional, irresponsive and rudderless government of APC with its attendant suffering, miseries, political deceit, economic woes, insecurity and all-round disappointment foisted on millions of Nigerian families across the federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe caucus said it arrived at the decision at the end of a virtual meeting of members Saturday August 7, 2021 over current concerns on the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThey accused Secondus of placing personal interests above building a vibrant opposition political party as expected in a democratic setting, noting that \u201cPDP members and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipate vigorous and well coordinated issue-based national opposition in preparation for a national convention and the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTo many, the National Chairman seems much more contented with occupying the office and therefore preoccupied with holding onto his position rather than preparing for next elections; this explains for his inexplicably missing endless opportunities that ought to have been utilized for consolidating a viable opposition; skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition and frustrating genuine party members across states which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no clear road map, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the Chairman, thus the party is allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe lax and bedroom managerial attitude of the Chairman who runs the party from his home and only surfaces in the party office for meetings, coupled with several promises without commensurate action has led to inept management of complaints, despondency amongst members and consequently an exodus of members of the party at all levels, including a member of the Board of Trustee of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhilst these misfortunes befell the party and concerned party members are busy trying to stem the tide, the party Chairman has carried on as if all is well and does not appear to see the caldron awaiting the party if it continues on that trajectory\u201d, the caucus\u2019 statement said in part.\n\nNational vice chairs join call\n\nIn the same vein, the party\u2019s national vice chairmen are also asking for Secondus\u2019 resignation.\n\nIn a statement Monday in Ibadan, the party\u2019s national vice chair in the South-west, Ambassador Taofeek Oladejo Arapaja, said the decision was the outcome of an emergency meeting of the national vice-chairmen held in Abuja Sunday to review developments within the party.\n\nThe statement said the meeting also urged stakeholders to remain steadfast \u201cas PDP remains the hope of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nArapaja listed the resolutions to include; \u201cThat the National Chairman of the party Prince Uche Secondus, Should resign and save the party from further disintegration being witness presently in the party.\n\n\u201cThat the resignation of its national officers is as a result of the inert leadership of the National Chairman, and as well the movement of Governor of the party to the failed ruling party.\n\n\u201cThey as well resolved that all Party stakeholders and party faithful should remain calm and resolute to the party as the party is the only hope of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe resolution was jointly signed by the National Vice-chairman of people Democratic party (PDP) from South-wWest Zone Ambassador Taofeek Oladejo Arapaja, South South Zone Chief Dan Osi, South-east Chief (Dr) Ali Odefa and North-central Dankas Shau.\n\nReps\u2019 minority leader differs\n\nBut contrary to the caucus\u2019 position, the House minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu said there was no meeting where such decision was taken.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Elumelu said: \u201cAttention of the Minority Caucus, particularly members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives, have been drawn to news reports purporting to be the intervention and outcome of an online meeting of the PDP Caucus in the House regarding the current leadership challenge within the party.\n\n\u201cIf such a meeting held, it was without the knowledge of the leadership of the Minority Caucus, and therefore in breach of established procedure.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we are working in concert with organs of the party to ensure sustainable resolution of the current challenges that will be in the overall interest of the party and Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all party faithful, particularly PDP members in the House of Representatives, to exercise caution and patience as the party addresses the present leadership challenges.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t quit -Secondus\n\nAmidst the tension generated by the call for his resignation, the party chair insisted he would not quit office.\n\nIn a statement Monday by his special adviser on media, Ike Abonyi, the embattled party chair said: \u201cNothing so far warrants his resignation from the party position and those tiny minority calling for his resignation should come clean and tell party members across the country his offense why he should resign.\n\n\u201cHe said he will remain focused and committed to the ideals of the party which he swore to protect and defend upon his election to lead this great party 44 months ago.\u201d\n\n\u2018Call violation of extant laws\u2019\n\nBacking Secondus also, the party\u2019s legal adviser, Emmanuel Enoidem said the call for his resignation was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, he said: \u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cSubsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge am not aware of any meeting of NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of resignation of any officer of our party at any level is a personal decision as stipulated in Sections 45(1) & 47 (5). There is no provision of our constitution which donates powers to any organ, individuals or group of persons to ask an officer of the party to resign for any reason whatsoever as was purported in the so called press release.\n\n\u201cThe powers to remove any member of the NWC and indeed any national officer is reserved in the national convention which is due for December 2021. The said press release is an unfortunate assault and blatant violation of the provisions of our constitution and so it is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThis is more so when the purported meeting was said to have been convened on Sunday August 8, 2021 against the widely published position taken by the BOT advising members and leaders of our party to maintain peace until a committee set up has deliberated on the raging controversies.\n\n\u201cThis bad press caused the party at this critical time is most uncalled for, needless and wanton and must be discontinued if we are mindful of the interest of the party.\u201d\n\nDickson backs Secondus\n\nAlso drumming support for Secondus, Senator Seriake Dickson (PDP Bayelsa West) said the party chair cannot be stampeded out of office.\n\nDickson, who stated this Monday in a personally signed statement in Abuja, said only National Convention of the party can remove Secondus as chairman and not antagonistic NWC members.\n\nHe said the call for Secondus resignation by some members of the party was orchestrated and aimed at throwing the party into needless crisis ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe purported call made by the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives for Secondus resignation is a ruse as the leader of the caucus , Hon Ndudi Elumelu , had issued a rebuttal.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to a purported statement by some members of the National Working Committee who went outside the constitution of the party and convened a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the chairman.\n\n\u201cI want to draw the attention of PDP leaders, members and Nigerians at large that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and does not represent a valid resolution or decision of the National Working Committee known to the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, only the national chairman of the party can summon and preside over meetings of the organs of the party especially the NWC of which he is chairman. So the purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: 3 members of the working committee and 3 Vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians should disregard the reported decision of the purported rep caucus meeting.\u201d\n\nGovs determine fate today\n\nMeanwhile, governors elected on the PDP platform, would continue their meeting today (Tuesday) to decide the fate of the party\u2019s embattled chair.\n\nThey had earlier met Monday at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro District, Abuja, but couldn\u2019t conclude deliberations at the end of their meeting.\n\nSecondus arrived venue of the meeting a few minutes after 4 p.m.\n\nLast week, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum appealed for calm over the leadership crisis currently bedevilling the party.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has called on state governments and citizens to take more proactive steps to combat the outbreak of cholera across states in Nigeria.\n\nThe agency made the appeal in a report released on Monday, where it stated that there have been 31,425 suspected cases of cholera and 816 deaths reported from 22 states and the FCT, between January 1 and August 1, 2021.\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and the FCT.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, the recent outbreak has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nAlthough the NCDC activated the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on June 22 and has deployed rapid response teams to support the most affected states, it warned that those actions won\u2019t be enough.\n\n\u201cNone of these medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks,\u201d it warned.\n\n\u201cCholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, practices such as the wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use.\n\n\u201cThese lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths,\u201d the NCDC added.\n\nTo address the underlying issues in the long term, there is a need for access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene.\n\n\u201cWe continue to advocate for State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities,\u201d it added.\n\nAlso, the agency urged Nigerians to \u201ckeep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running water\u201d.\n\nApart from calling for stronger water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), the NCDC is also ramping up efforts to stop the outbreak through the EOC, which is hosted at the NCDC includes representation from the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.\n\nSo far, it has deployed rapid response teams to Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi, and Plateau State, which are the most affected states.\n\nAdditionally, it has, along with its partners, provided states with commodities for case management and laboratory diagnosis, materials for risk communications, response guidelines among other support.\n\nFrom July 24 to 28, a reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA.\n\nThe Cholera outbreak in Nigeria has worsened in recent months with more states reporting deaths, adding pressure to an already stretched health sector that has battled the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently weighed down by the strike by resident doctors which is now in its second week.\n\nOn Saturday, the Katsina State Government confirmed that it had recorded over 60 Cholera deaths.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have over 1,400 confirmed cases of cholera with over 60 recorded deads,\u201d the Katsina State Commissioner for Health, Yakubu Danja, said during the 2021 Annual General Meeting of the State chapter of Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) held in the state capital.\n\nThe NCDC in its report advised Nigerians to visit a health facility immediately if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cCholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately,\u201d it warned.",

          "text": "A South African court has again postponed a long-delayed corruption trial against jailed former president Jacob Zuma to September 9 following his hospitalisation last week for an undisclosed medical condition.\n\nZuma, whose jailing last month for 15 months on a separate contempt of court matter led to a wave of looting and unrest, was expected to appear in court in a $2 billion arms deal corruption case that led to his sacking as South Africa\u2019s deputy president in 2005.\n\nHe was moved to a hospital on Friday for medical observation. Prison officials did not provide details on his condition.\n\nHigh Court Judge Piet Koen granted the postponement but ordered Zuma\u2019s team to produce a medical report by Aug. 20. He also ordered the state to appoint a medical doctor of its choice to assess whether Zuma was fit to stand trial and give evidence.\n\n\u201cWe are at the moment completely in the dark as to the justification for the postponement, more particularly Mr Zuma\u2019s condition,\u201d said Wim Trengove, representing the National Prosecuting Authority, during a virtual hearing.\n\nTrengove said that, according to a letter from Zuma\u2019s doctor, the former president suffered from a condition requiring extensive emergency procedures that had been delayed for 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe find it very hard to understand how that suddenly transforms into an inability to stand trial,\u201d he said.\n\nZuma\u2019s lawyer Dali Mpofu said his client\u2019s medical condition was a matter of confidentiality.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the problem has existed for 18 months is exactly the reason why it is exacerbated now, especially since the incarceration of the accused,\u201d he told the hearing.\n\nZuma, 79, last month asked the Constitutional Court to annul his jail sentence, partly on the grounds that he was suffering from an unspecified medical condition.\n\nIn the dock with French arms firm Thales (TCFP.PA), Zuma is facing 18 charges including corruption and money laundering and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Thales has also denied wrongdoing.",

Despite our energetic appeal, the deciding committee made its announcement which gave no latitude to our team members for what was only an inadvertent lapse.\n\n\u201cAs the Minister I must bear some institutional responsibility for this lapse \u2026 I have ordered a full investigation that will not only uncover what happened but will also, recommend a process where such lapses can never occur in the future and initiate leveraging compliance monitoring technology to guardrail this.\n\n\u201cI have personally apologized to the affected athletes.

          "text": "United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has decried low birth registration in the country, stating that more than 50% of the births of children under 5 remain unregistered in Nigeria.\n\nUNICEF while lamenting that Africa has the lowest birth registration of all the continent, lamented that the births of 166 million children under 5 have never been recorded worldwide.\n\nA statement on Tuesday by UNICEF said with only 44 per cent of children registered at birth and millions of deaths also go uncounted each year. Nigeria alone accounts for 11 per cent of unregistered children in West Africa.\n\nThe statement read that as Nigeria joins the rest of the World in commemorating Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Day on Tuesday, addressing structural, normative and operational challenges to birth registration should be on the front burner.\n\nThe statement emphasized that birth registration is a one-off event that gives every child a unique identity which will give them better access to vital services like health, education, and social protection.\n\nThe statement quoted the UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative, Peter Hawkins, to have said: \u201cEvery child counts \u2013 and we must ensure that we count every child, so that they can best benefit from important services like health and education,\u201d while stressing that: \u201cWe need to work together to ensure effective coordination to make this happen. Functional systems that allow for the sharing of data across information management databases that are integrated with other vital services are necessary to push the birth registration rate in Nigeria up, and make sure every child is counted.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Population Council (NPC) has identified information and communication technology assets to support effective CRVS systems that are integrated with other governmental systems, such as health and identity management, to ensure the highest standards of data protection and confidentiality of personal data to promote birth registration among civil registration, health, and identity management systems.\n\nHawkins said. \u201cEvery child has a right to a name, a nationality and a legal identity,\u201d noting that: \u201cWorking together, we can and must bring Nigeria to meeting its SDG obligation to provide a legal identify for all, including through birth registration.\u201d\n\nThe statement revealed that the NPC, in partnership with Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) entities, and with support from UNICEF, co-created a Roadmap for Digital Universal Birth Registration in Nigeria, which laid out a clear vision, delineates the roles of different government agencies, builds the government\u2019s capacity to deliver, formulates an action plan, sets a timetable and milestones, and optimizes the cost of the digital birth registration process in the country.\n\nAll of this is in advance of the implementation deadline of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which targets 16.9 calls for governments, by 2030, to provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\n\nThe statement stressed that the indicator for the target is the \u201cproportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
