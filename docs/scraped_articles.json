          "text": "The Rescue Nigeria Mission, a movement mobilising for the emergence of Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi as Nigeria\u2019s next President, on Saturday, held a town hall meeting with women and youths in Kano.\n\nThe coordinator of the movement in Kano State, Mr Abdul Amat-Maikwashewa, said the Kogi governor had contributed immensely to the development of youths in Nigeria by drawing them closer to his government and instituting people-oriented policies for their benefit.\n\nAmat-Maikwashewa said members of the group came up with the idea of queueing behind Bello for as Presidential candidate was because \u201clooking around, no one beats his record currently in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to go to him to plead with him to run because he is not part of the old order and he is a formidable youth through whom we can realise the yearning of youths to take over governance in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief of Staff to the Kogi governor, Mr Abdulkareem Jamiu, who was at the inauguration of the members, said Nigeria needed to breathe fresh air in the interest of the country and Nigerians at large.\n\nHe urged the youths not to allow any unqualified and old politician seeking elective posts to determine the destiny of the younger generation who represented 70 per cent of the population.\n\nJamiu thanked the organisers for the confidence in Bello and reiterated that he possessed the capacity and agility to end security and economic difficulties confronting the country.\n\nHe said if Bello could decimate the enormous challenges and restore sanity to Kogi, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason for doubting the governor\u2019s dexterity to put Nigeria in order.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf Bello can provide solution to numerous challenges confronting Kogi , we have no doubt that he can answer the questions of Nigeria. First of all, what is the problem of Kogi ? Kogi is the only state that borders 10 states, including FCT, making the state a mini Nigeria.\n\n\u201cKogi used to be the nerve centre of security threat, that was before Bello took over the mantle of leadership. Okene, my home local government used to house a bomb factory. Bombing of churches, mosques and public places was the order of the day as a result of Boko Haram and terrorist activities before this administration took over.\n\n\u201cKogi was the centre of communal clash, a situation where one ethnic group dominated other minority groups. As a result, the state was simply a theatre of anarchy, conflict and unrest.\n\n\u201cThat period, when you enter the state capital, Lokoja, it was like a grave yard because there was no electricity, no development and sources of livelihood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the governor took over, we engaged the services of security with support from local vigilante group to restore peace in the state.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have bombing factory, the issue of marginalization has gone forever. Communal clash is over and peace reigns supreme in Kogi. Thank God for the purposeful leadership of the governor,\u201d Jamiu said. (NAN)",

          "text": "By Emma Amaize\n\nACTIVISTS under the auspices of 21st Century Youths of Niger-Delta and Agitators for Conscience, 21st CYNDAC, Saturday, said current happenings in the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, was untidier than the state of affairs, over two years ago, when President Muhammadu Buhari ordered a forensic audit of the interventionist agency from 2001-2019.\n\nThe group in a statement by the spokesperson, Izon Ebi, said: \u201cWhat is happening in the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, presently is worse than what gave birth to Mr. President, Muhammadu Buhari, calling for a forensic audit of the NDDC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the leadership of the National Assembly, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to do the needful by advising Mr. President to immediately inaugurate the substantive board of NDDC so as not to be seen as the persons that conspired with Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio, to plunge Niger Delta region into fresh crisis capable of eroding the gains of the present peace being enjoyed by Niger -Deltans and oil multinationals.\n\n\u201cWe also call on Mr President to immediately inaugurate the substantive board of the NDDC to avoid Niger Delta youths going into artisanal petroleum refineries that have been the order of the day in the region because of the failure of inaugurating the substantive board of the NDDC.\n\nALSO READ: Why Enugu people, not one man, should choose next governor\n\n\u201cThe 21st CYNDAC is sounding it very loud in order not to ground the economy of the nation. As it stands now, Niger Deltans have lost confidence in the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and the outcome of the forensic audit.\n\n\u201cThe minister is seen as a person that can trade his people and the peace of the Niger Delta region for his political aspirations and selfish disposition and gains.\n\n\u201cThe 21st CYNDAC condemns in strong terms the antics of the minister because his body language and actions.\n\n\u201cHe has succeeded in running the NDDC aground by putting everybody in the Niger Delta in an autoroute mood of imminent violence and anarchy. Akpabio is running the NDDC as his private owned company.\n\n\u201cNiger Deltans are awakened with bogus allegations of bribery and payments of frivolous water desilting jobs that are not done anywhere in the region because of kickback of 70 per cent percent without the jobs done.\n\n\u201cWe are back to the status quo because some top officials too are collecting kickback of 10 per cent of every payment made to contractors. It is glaringly clear that somebody has succeeded in arm twisting Mr President to concede the supervision of the NDDC to himself, which is now administered as a private owned company.\n\n\u201cNigerians and Niger Deltans knows the truth and cannot be hoodwinked by the bogus, frivolous and politically motivated forensic audit that was done to muzzle Niger -Deltans under Akpabio\u2019s political dominance.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, the North East Development Commission is making progress without any contribution to the nation\u2019s GDP, but the Niger Delta region that pays the supreme sacrifice of contributing 80 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP is being used by our so -called leaders and politicians for political brinkmanship and showmanship to the detriment of the pathetic plight of the Niger Delta region and its people.\n\n\u201cIt is glaring clear to all Niger Delta leaders, youths and Nigerians that the minister was never sincere from the onset, but was just a political ploy to hoodwink Mr. President to stamp his dominance in the politics of Niger Delta because of his presidential ambition come 2023. The chicken has come out to roast as every Nigerian is aware of the antics of Akpabio.\n\n\u201cWith the present clampdown of artisan refineries by the governor of Rivers state and security agencies, we are gradually moving to the status quo of destruction of pipelines which will affect the economy and revenue of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe president should do the needful to avoid Niger Delta youths going back to the dark days of old,\u201d the group warned.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Oladipo Diya (rtd) has described the former Chairman of the Interim National Government, late Chief Ernest Adegunle Shonekan as a catalyst for stability and progress.\n\nDiya, who said this in a tribute he wrote on the demise of Shonekan, said the late elder statesman heeded the clarion call to stem the nation turbulent situation after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 Presidential election.\n\nHe wrote; \u201cThe nation was at a crossroads. The polity was heated across all fronts. The Nation needed a stabilizer and unifier.\n\n\u201cThen came in Chief Ernest Shonekan, The Abese of Egba land.\n\n\u201cHe selflessly heeded the clarion call to serve as Chairman of the Interim National Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He went about his duty with guile, firmness and resolve.\n\n\u201cAs the icon was laid to rest yesterday, February 4, it is instructive to note that Chief Ernest Shonekan was not new to stepping into turbulent situations to calm the tides.\n\n\u201cHe has always been a catalyst for stability and progress.\n\n\u201cTime was of the essence and the task was herculean. We saw it all as the lawyer, industrialist, accomplished administrator, and statesman calmed the nerves of the nation.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest Shonekan and I were close. We shared decades of amazing friendship built on mutual trust and respect.\n\n\u201cHe was the big brother I looked up to for counsel and he never disappointed. What a Statesman we lost with his passing, even at 85.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes to the respected and adorable Mrs Magareth Shonekan and the children.\n\n\u201cMay the good Lord grant the entire family, near and extended the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss of this great national icon.\n\n\u201cI give my last salute to a selfless patriot and National hero, in Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan was great in life. He was even greater in death. It is heartwarming to watch the Nigerian State accord the former Head of Government a well-deserving state burial.\n\n\u201cSpecial thanks to President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring due diligence before, during and after the burial of Chief Shonekan.\n\n\u201cAbly represented by our amiable Vice President, Prof. Yemi Oshinbajo (SAN), at the All Saints Cathedral, Marina Lagos, for the Order of State Funeral Service for His Excellency Chief Ernest Shonekan.\u201d\n\nDiya charged other statesmen to, as a matter of national call and duty, fix Nigeria in all its ramifications, in order to bequeath a worthy Nigeria to unborn generations.\n\nHe added, \u201d the time to act is now. This is the time for strategic national advancement. It\u2019s not a moment for finger pointing or politicking.\n\n\u201cAlthough, I have never been involved in politics, it is nevertheless to lay it bare and send a clear message that only justice, equity and fairness can take us out of the woods.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that President Muhammadu Buhari is obviously doing his best in repositioning the economy and winning the war against terror, he said more work still needs to be done.\n\n\u201cThe success rests not only in the barrel or sacrifice of our gallant Armed Forces, but more so by the cooperation of all Nigerians. A word should be enough for the wise.\n\n\u201cFor Chief shonekan: he came, he saw and he conquered. Like the famous Indian quote \u201cthe problem of the State is so difficult that you alone cannot solve it.\u201d\n\nThough Chief Shonekan faced his challenges, history and fate was rather kind to him.\n\n\u201cThough he had gone to rest, his legacy of excellence, hard work and integrity will forever remain with us,\u201d he added.\n\nVanguard News",

It is about Federal Government doing its own, working in partnership with the state government and even the local government and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cEvery single project of Federal Government of Nigeria whether it is a constituency project or direct project from the Federal Government is to complement what the state government is doing and that partnership has been so purposeful that today in every corner, in every part of Nigeria, you have infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of President Muhammadu Buhari is in a hurry. We are in a hurry to develop Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBy 2023, Nigeria would have been turned into an infrastructural laboratory because in every part of Nigeria, from the east to the west to the north to the south, there is something going on.\n\n\u201cIn the east, the Second Niger Bridge, today it is at 75 to 80 per cent completion level. For 20 years, those people, they will go there, do groundbreaking and disappear to the ground. Another person would come, do groundbreaking and disappear to the ground.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari did only one groundbreaking and today, it is at 75 per cent completion level. That is what it is, in every part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo the synergy between our states and the Federal government is working. It is making Nigeria to develop the infrastructure that we need. We have never seen it done like this one by this administration,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President was full of commendation for the Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for changing the narratives in the state in terms of development and urged the people of Kwara State to consider him for another term to continue his good work.\n\n\u201cAPC administration in this state is barely two and half years but we know how far we have gone in two and half years.\n\n\u201cOthers were here for 16 years. What you(Governor Abdulrazaq) have been able to do in two and half years can be favourably compared with what others could not do in 16 years.\n\n\u201cNo one should deceive you. No one should confuse you. Elect His Excellency, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for a second term. He has already performed so well in two and half years,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nLawan said the Empowerment Programme of Senator Sadiq Suleiman Umar was to complement the efforts of the state government.\n\nThe Senate President extolled the virtues of the Kwara North Senator for his commitment and dedication to work and for the quality representation of his people at the Senate.\n\nLawan said the people of Kwara had sent the best team to represent them at the Senate and appealed to them to continue to support the return bid of their three senators to the National Assembly.\n\nThe six Senators in company of the Senate President on the trip from Abuja were Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi( Senate Deputy Chief Whip), Bello Mandiya, Yakubu Oseni, Ibrahim Oloriegbe, Lola Ashiru and Smart Adeyemi.",

By the Grace of God, the National Assembly will finish its role of leading in the review of the constitution by the end of this month and send it to the States.\n\n\u201cThe traditional Institutions have always been there and they are there longer than political Institutions\u2026We face security issues. Insecurity is pervasive.\n\n\u201cThank God, the Federal Government is not stopping at anything to restore normalcy. But the Federal Government and indeed all our security agencies across all the tiers of government cannot achieve the kind of the desired outcome without citizens\u2019 participation and we believe that to mobilise the citizens, we need our traditional Institutions.\n\n\u201cThat is where official participation of traditional Institutions in governance is very important and central. We are going to push for that by the Grace of God. We want to see it reflected this time around and by the time this is achieved, our traditional Institutions will now perform even better the functions they are already performing,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nResponding, Sulu-Gambari thanked the Senate President for the visit but told his guest that he and his traditional ruler colleagues had no intention to compete with any institution.\n\nHe said they were not asking for a legislative or judicial role but just advisory functions.\n\n\u201cWhat we ask for is advisory participation. We are saying that there should be a Council of traditional rulers who could be sought to give advice and to take part in bringing sanity to the governance of this country,\u201d the Emir said.",

This is in recognition of Nigeria\u2019s sterling contributions to the maintenance of peace and security in Africa and beyond. It is in consonance with the AUPSC Protocol and without prejudice to the 2/3 votes standard requirement.\n\nThe PSC is a standing decision-making organ of the African Union charged with responsibilities of conducting early warning and preventive diplomacy; facilitating peace-making; establish peace-support operations; and, in certain circumstances recommend intervention in Member States to promote peace, security and stability. The PSC works in support of peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction as well as humanitarian action and disaster management.

The PSC also ensures the implementation of key conventions and instruments to combat international terrorism; promote coordination between regional mechanisms and the AU with respect to peace, security and stability in Africa.\n\nGoing forward, Nigeria\u2019s objectives in the AU-PSC will remain guided by the renewed commitment of the Administration of H.E. President Muhammed Buhari, towards accelerating the ongoing implementation of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) and the African Governance Architecture (AGA) in line with the core objectives of the AU Agenda 2063 and the UN 2030 Agenda.

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nNotable southern and northern socio-political groups, as well as some eminent Nigerians, yesterday lampooned the Federal government over its claim that it had identified 96 financiers of terrorism, involving about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change.\n\nThey wondered why it has become impossible for the government to apprehend and prosecute\n\nThe list include Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), the North West arm of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Yoruba political group, Afenifere, pan-Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Nd\u00edgbo Worldwide, Aka Ikenga, the Middle Belt Forum, and Prof. Itse Sagay.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had made the claim in Abuja on Thursday. He had also said government had identified 26 bandits and seven co-conspirators linked to financing of terrorism in Nigeria, among others.\n\nAccording to him, the discoveries were made by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) between 2020 and 2021. He, however, did not name the alleged culprits neither did he say what actions the government has taken against them. Reacting to the development, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, the MBF, some other socio-cultural organisations and senior lawyers accused the minister of filling his address with rhetoric and no substance.\n\nBut the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) supported the Federal Government\u2019s move.\n\nNo more stories, defeat terrorists \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia noted that Nigerians are tired of hearing about \u201cuncovering Boko Haram sponsors.\u201d Rather they want to hear about total defeat of the terrorist organisation.\n\nGovt not showing sincerity \u2013 Afenifere\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said the government has not shown adequate concern and sincerity in prosecuting the war against terrorism.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, noted that government officials have at different times talked about the efforts the administration is making at curtailing the menace of terrorism\n\nHe said, \u201cOther than these occasional reports of bombardments of terrorists\u2019 camps by the military, no concrete steps are seen to be taken by the government to tackle the roots of the problem. Indeed, the failure of the government to act decisively in this respect has emboldened the terrorists to be more daring, leading to the death of thousands of people and capturing of many communities particularly in the northern part of the country by the terror groups.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, many Nigerians are gradually losing confidence in the federal government\u2019s claims on the war against terrorism, as many of the claims and promises made in the past were not followed up with necessary actions.\n\nTerrorists are protected by govt. \u2013 MBF\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, accused Alhaji Mohammed of being economical with the truth. He noted that, on the contrary, there are indications that suggest that the current administration is protecting the terrorists. According to him the press conference by the Minister was the usual: \u201cwe-have- done-this, we-have-done-that claims that end up not naming the terrorists and their sponsors.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cOne thing we know is that we have a government that accused President Goodluck Jonathan when he was in office of killing their people. When Lt Gen Kenneth Minimah was the Army Chief, they accused him of killing northerners out of vengeance for what happened during the civil war, so Jonathan changed him. Then when the mercenaries were brought in from South Africa, they were doing the job and dealing with the terrorists and this President said they were killing his people. So, the question is: who are the people of the president?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nPogu said that though all the locations of the terrorists are known to the administration, it has not taken any action against them or done anything to end the insurgency.\n\nOn how to end the cycle of terrorism, he advised that the government should make public the list of the alleged sponsors and let the accused defend themselves, even as the military should be unleashed without hindrance on the terrorists.\n\nIt is crass propaganda \u2013 Aka Ikenga\n\nMaking his view known on the matter, a lawyer, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike, former President of Aka Ikenga, an Igbo intelligentsia group, tagged the press conference a display of \u201ccrass and unmistakable propaganda.\u201d He recalled that about two years ago, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), convicted a Nigerian for financial ties to ISWAP and Boko Haram and relayed all information pertaining to the case, including names of those involved, to the Federal Government. But it did nothing until the UAE broke the news. He noted that \u201cLai has carved a niche for himself in saying a lot and saying nothing new. It\u2019s just all smoke and no substance.\u201dLike others, he accused elements in the Nigerian government of shielding the terrorists.\n\nOn whether the government should prosecute those allegedly identified, he answered in the affirmative. He is, however afraid that \u201cfall guys\u201d may take the fall while the actual financiers are allowed to walk free.\n\nRelease list of sponsors, financiers \u2013 ACF, CAN North West Zone\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) as well as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), North West Zone called on the Federal Government to release the list of sponsors and financiers of Boko Haram and terrorists if its claims were to be believed. National Publicity Secretary of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe said: \u201cIf the FG says it knows the people organising Boko Haram, what is stopping it from naming and prosecuting them? We have always called on the government to reveal the identities of the terrorists who have done so much damage.\n\n\u201cWhen the Zamfara State governor Bello Matawalle, said he knew them, our Chairman, Audu Ogbe, said he should reveal their names and let the heavens fall. At the time we thought he had some earthshaking revelations to make. Later, he named some humble people who couldn\u2019t have organised the terrorism on the scale we have seen in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary, North West zone of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), and former spokesman, Northern CAN, Elder Sunday Oibe, added: \u201cIf it is true that the FG is in the know of the sponsors of this evil against Nigerians and the Nigerian state, we are not interested in being told the story. Let the government go after them and make her findings public. The purpose of government is to solve problems and not to be telling stories. With all the instruments at government\u2019s disposal, we demand more result-oriented actions against terrorists, kidnappers, bandits, Boko Haram and every criminal elements troubling the soul of this country, including their sponsors and sympathizers, no matter how highly place they maybe. Government must do everything to stop this madness against the state. And as citizens, we must stand together against this evil.\u201d\n\nProf. Itse Sagay, Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption said there is no reason the names of people who have committed the worst crimes against humanity in Nigeria should not be announced or their faces paraded,. \u201cI agree with those who are critical of government\u2019s silence on this matter,\u201d he told Saturday Sun. \u201cThese people should be made known to the whole world because they have subjected us to much fear, humiliation and pains. We want to know them. So, I agree with the majority of Nigerians who are now crying out, insisting that the people should be identified and prosecuted to our knowledge and there must be no secrecy about this.\n\n\u201cWhy the government is not announcing the names of those that have been identified as supporting and sponsoring terrorism is what I can\u2019t just understand because when all these Yahoo Yahoo boys do things, they are brought before the camera. When people commit all sort of crimes their names are mentioned and their pictures splashed all over the place. \u201c\n\nYCE backs FG over non-release of names\n\nBut in a marked departure from positions held by others, the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) asked Nigerians not to criticise the Federal Government over the non-release of names of alleged sponsors.\n\nThe group\u2019s Secretary-General, Dr. Kunle Olajide, who made the disclosure during a telephone conversation with Saturday Sun on Friday, noted that the Federal Government might suffer legal consequences over such a move.\n\nHe noted that the statement made by the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, would have unsettled the sponsors, even without mentioning their names, adding that the FG must have been done further investigation on the matter. He urged Nigerians to be patient with the government in its campaign against crimes, especially insurgency and terrorism.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThe most topical and popular issue in South East today is the actualization of a Nigerian President from the region. Though some people believe that restructuring of the federation is what the Igbo needs at the moment, there are those clamouring for Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. To this end, the apex Igbo socio-cultural body, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has formed a non-partisan political action committee to push for the realization of the lofty dream.\n\nMany Igbo groups and leaders, including Igbo World Assembly (IWA), Nzuko Umunna, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) as well as a former National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, have recently spoken in support of President of South East extraction in 2023.\n\nAnnouncing the setting up of the committee in Enugu on Wednesday, President General of Ohanaeze, George Obiozor, said it would deploy persuasion in reaching out to key political actors across the country as well as other critical stakeholders and leaders.\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cpersuasion team would recognise those that are critical in Nigeria including our own people. They will also talk to our people here that are aspiring for the Presidency. The team is nonpartisan and non-political. We will try to reach everybody on the need for the South East to produce the next president.\u201d He argued that the basis for any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, rests on fair and even sharing of power.\n\nHe lamented that the twin-devil of power sharing and social justice has held Nigeria back and is about leading to its dismemberment. He restated that the Igbo were not secessionists or separatists, adding that they were prepared and deserved the presidency because it is politically defensible and morally justifiable.\n\nThe Ohanaeze leader declared that anybody working against the emergence of Igbo president does not wish Nigeria well because, according to him, only the Igbo can save the country at this critical period. He stated that the current series of national crisis facing the country were enough to bring it to its knees.\n\nSaturday Sun investigation shows that Obiozor and the body he represents are not alone in this thinking. Former Governor of Enugu State, Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo said that the South East has waited for close to 60 years for justice to be done in this area. He pointed out that the Igbo have supported other regions in the past and deserved all the backing and cooperation of other Nigerians.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe appeared on a national television on Thursday, to beg other Nigerians to forgive Igbo for any \u2018sin\u2019 they might have committed and give the prople a chance at the Presidency. He asked: \u201cWhat has the South East actually done to merit all of these? Is it that we lack people that can rule Nigeria or is there a crime we\u2019ve committed that this punishment is not yet over? I think our countrymen should have a conscience. And I believe that this country has a conscience.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the redressing of the injustice meted out to the Yorubas on the June 12 Presidential Election, he said: \u201cYes, there was injustice in June 12. The next opportunities that came up after Abacha suspended June 12, and when he left office, at the next election, justice was done to the people of South West. PDP nominated Olusegun Obasanjo. Even though Ogbonnaya Onu won the nomination in the opposition party, he had to yield to Olu Falae. This country has a conscience. We don\u2019t know why that conscience takes a flight when it comes to the South East. We think that we need that conscience to wake up and we need all right-thinking people of Nigeria who want to heal the wounds of yesterday, who want us to march together in unity and develop our country, to yield this position at this time in all parties to the South East.\u201d\n\nSpeaking similarly, Chairman of Igbo World Assembly, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze noted that the Igbo have demonstrated the highest virtues of patriotism and genuine nationalistic propensities in the history of Nigeria, from Nnamdi Azikiwe to the present.\n\nAddressing the Nigerian Inter-Ethnic Nationalities Dialogue on Presidency of Igbo extraction in 2023, he noted that by history and character, what defines Ndigbo is friendliness and peaceful coexistence with others regardless of tribe, religion or race. Ndigbo, he noted, are market people, travellers, entrepreneurs or businessmen.\n\nHe argued that all the regions of Nigeria had produced Presidents except the South East, stating that it is now the turn of the region to provide good leadership for the good of all Nigerians so as to move the country in a positive direction. He raised the alarm of plots by some presidential aspirants to thwart the aspiration of the South East by getting Vice President from the Southern part of the country. He said that the South East was poised for the position of president and nothing less, adding that any betrayal would be against the national interest.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, South East youths vowed to move against anybody from the zone that is angling for the position of Vice President in 2023. According to President General, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), Goodluck Ibem, the zone will not accept the position of vice president. \u201cWe want one of our own to be elected President in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing more, nothing less. Ndigbo has worked hard towards the development of Nigeria and deserves to be supported to occupy the No. 1 seat in the country.\u201d\n\nThe group commended Ohanaeze Ndigbo for forming the political action committee chaired by its president, Obiozor with its secretary general, Amb. Okey Emuchay as secretary. He pleaded with the committee to ensure that those to be selected as members are people of high integrity, patriotism, proven track record and wide political contacts across the country. He also asked it to stand firm and work assiduously to ensure that South East geopolitical zone is supported by other zones to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023.",

          "text": "*Gowon, Jonathan, Boss Mustapha also present as former Head of ING is buried in Lagos\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday described the former Head of Interim Government (ING) the late Ernest Shonekan as a man of destiny who was chosen for his time.\n\nSpeaking at the State funeral service, organised in honour of the departed national leader, held at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Marina, Lagos, Osinbajo said Shonekan proved by his life \u201cthat destiny for one or for a nation is the manifest result of small choices made every day by ordinary people doing the best they can and persevering in goodness.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President said Shonekan lived an extraordinary and selfless life while on earth and left a lesson behind for all Nigerians to follow.\n\n\u201cThat Chief Shonekan lived an extraordinary life is self-evident. His accomplishments as a businessman, political figure, and bridge builder are already the stuff of legend and will be talked about for generations. But perhaps what deserves greater attention is the way he carried himself through life and the high values he exemplified, that genuine respect he had for people of all classes, religion, tribe or gender.\n\n\u201cHis unflinching belief in the inherent goodness of everyone; his love and generosity not just to his family, but to all, the knowledge and experience driven leadership and counsel he provided, always with unfailing humility and courteousness, were all the unique virtues that underpinned his extraordinary achievements.\n\n\u201cErnest Shonekan leaves a life lesson for the nation he leaves behind. What might that be? We would be right to think of Ernest Shonekan as a man of destiny, a man chosen for his time.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said what deserved great attention was the way Shonekan carried himself through life and the high values he exemplified during his time on earth.\n\nHe said that Shonekan had a genuine respect for all and would not be forgotten in the sands of time and history.\n\n\u201cHis love and generosity, not just to his family but to all, was felt by all. His counsels are always with unfailing humility and courteousness. These are unique virtues that underpinned his selflessness.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan lived his life always conscious of, and motivated by a burden of duty, as a citizen of considerable privilege, to give back, either in his many philanthropic and civic pursuits or in public service.\n\n\u201cToday, we stand in the light of this great man. The inevitable transition of the people that we love gives us a sombre opportunity to look into the life that they led, and in that light, checkmate our own lives,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nSpeaking on his tenure as Head of ING, Osinbajo said: \u201cShonekan had a position in Nigeria that few had before him or have now. But none could have written the script of the dramatic series of occurrences that thrust upon him the role of the Head of State and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, in one of the most turbulent chapters of our nation\u2019s history and it became his lot to steer the ship of state in those extremely stormy waters.\n\n\u201cHe was in his own words compelled by a sense of duty and responsibility to accept the role and to give his best in shepherding his country through an experience unknown and unprecedented in our history.\n\n\u201cHe once said in an interview shortly after he was named Chairman of the Transitional Council and Head of Government, \u201cIf your country needs you, leave everything that you are doing to go and help.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Shonekan\u2019s last days, the VP said: \u201cIn the last chapter of his life, Chief Shonekan assumed the mantle of an elder statesman. He was supportive of all governments and gave his advice far above the trenches of partisanship. He was consistently calm and dignified. He was a steady voice of national counsel to all who sought him out.\u201d\n\nDignitaries at the event include former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon (retd.); former President Goodluck Jonathan; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; and Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki.\n\nAt the Ebony Vaults and Garden, Ikoyi, Lagos State, where Shonekan was interred, the Nigerian Army, 81 Division, honoured him with a 21-artillery-gun salute.\n\nShonekan died on January 11, aged 85. He served as Head of the ING from August 26, 1993 to November 17, 1993.\n\nNight of Tribute\n\nEarlier on Thursday night, President Muhammadu Buhari and other dignitaries paid tributes to Shonekan during A Night of Tributes in Lagos.\n\nBoss Mustapha represented the President at the event.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cChief Shonekan was a man I respect so much because of his passion for the development of Nigeria. He was a patriot and a father of the nation. I knew that at the time he was beckoned to lead the country, no faint-hearted man would do that. No man will offer himself as a sacrificial lamb in the manner of Chief Shonekan.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Council of State, Chief Shonekan attended all meetings until his demise because of his passion to see Nigeria grow. In the last four years, there was hardly any state event that he was invited to that he ever missed.\n\n\u201cHe was a successful lawyer and businessman who rose through the ranks of UAC before he became the Head of Interim Government.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said Shonekan demonstrated leadership in every facet of life.\n\nHe said, \u201cHe was a respected industrialist, a first class boardroom guru. He was in his early 40s when he rose to become the Chairman of UAC. By this single deed, he became a role model to many Nigerians. He laid the foundation of many things we enjoy today.\n\n\u201cAfter reaching the zenith of his private sector life, faith made him the Head of the ING. It was a turbulent time in the life of our country. He led the country with all sense of courage and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cNigeria has indeed lost a true leader; he was a kind human being and his wealth of experience will be sorely missed. We will continue to cherish his memory.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Ogun State Governor, Mr. Dapo Abiodun, said Shonekan lived a life of humility.\n\n\u201cBaba\u2019s life and time are inspiring narratives of events and achievements. His transition has left a void and it is the end of an era. He was a colossus whose feat will be difficult to replicate.\n\n\u201cBeyond business, our nation remains grateful to him for his role during the trying periods. He was a loving husband, an embodiment of humility. His selfless service will be sorely missed,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nHis brother, Chief Tunji Shonekan, described the deceased as a peacemaker, a family man and a core Egba man.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Peter Uzoho\n\nNigeria\u2019s daily power generation has fallen by an alarming 630 megawatts (MW) since Wednesday following a fire outbreak at Egbin Power Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos State and the resultant shut down of generation by the company.\n\nThis development, coupled with the load reduction mechanism adopted by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to prevent system collapse, has worsened the power supply situation in Lagos State. Electricity consumers in the state and its environs have been witnessing constant power outages for several weeks.\n\nEgbin Power had, in a statement issued to its stakeholders and the general public yesterday, reported the fire incident at its power plant on Wednesday, February 2, 2022, at about 4.20pm, leading to blackout in Lagos State.\n\nThe thermal plant has an installed capacity of 1,320MW consisting of six turbines of 220MW each, while its actual average generating capacity is about 800MW.\n\nEgbin said the fire outbreak was successfully contained by a team of its firefighters in collaboration with firefighters from the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) in Egbin.\n\nThe company said it had set out a process to determine the cause of the fire incident as it had temporarily suspended its operations in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures.\n\n\u201cEgbin has since activated its emergency response mechanism to determine the cause of the incident, while operations at the plant have been temporarily suspended in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures. Egbin is also working with the Federal Fire Service, the Federal Ministry of Power and other stakeholders to review the incident,\u201d the management of the power plant said in the statement.\n\nConfirming the fire incident and its technical implications, TCN\u2019s spokesperson, Mrs. Ndidi Mba, told THISDAY yesterday that it had led to the removal of a total of 630MW from the national grid.\n\nMba said, \u201cWe know that there was a fire outbreak and the total generation of 630MW was removed from the grid because of that.\n\n\u201cYou know, when a fire outbreak happens, even if it doesn\u2019t affect the entire units, the tendency is that, to protect the other ones, you shut them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, 630mw was removed from the grid on that day (Wednesday).\u201d\n\nNigeria generates an average of 8,000mw of electricity daily, out of the installed 13,800mw capacity, transmits an average of 5,000mw, while distribution hovers between 3,000 and 2,500mw.\n\nMeanwhile, electricity consumers in Lagos and its environs have recently been witnessing constant power outages.\n\nThe two distribution companies serving Lagos \u2013 Ikeja Electric (IE) and Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) -attributed the outages under their networks to a drop in power generation in the country.\n\nIn a recent statement for its customers, IE blamed the power outage experienced in certain parts of its network on load shedding by the TCN as a result of a drop in power generation.\n\nEKEDC had also attributed the reduction in supply to the drop in power generation from an average of 3,700MW to 2,000MW.\n\nThe Disco said this was caused by gas limitations arising from vandalism and more recently an issue affecting the TCN line from the Egbin Power Plant.\n\nExplaining the constant power outages in Lagos State in recent times, the TCN spokesperson stated that the state was a high consumption area and that the agency had to reduce the load to avoid overloading 330kv lines within the state and to achieve load balance.\n\nMeanwhile, Egbin has assured the public that its technical team is working assiduously to restore operations.\n\n\u201cAs the foremost power plant in the nation, Egbin remains committed to providing power innovatively and responsibly in compliance with good health, safety and environmental standards,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ahamefula Ogbu\n\nThe United States of America has condemned as unacceptable and out of vogue, any change of government in Africa except as constitutionally enshrined through elections and popular ballot as coups undermine democracy and development.\n\nThe US, apparently responding to the four recent coups in the continent, assured therefore that any regime which gains power through coups would not enjoy the support and recognition of the United States seen as the bastion of democracy.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Commander of the United States Africa Command, AFRICOM, General Stephen Townsend who while expressing surprise at the recent upsurge in spate of military coups in Africa, opined that bad governance and corruption may have been responsible for the putsches.\n\nIn the last 18 months, the military has seized power in Mali, Chad, Sudan and Burkina Faso.\n\nTownsend had in a virtual briefing on Thursday, where he took questions from journalists, explained that the United States frowns at irregular or unconstitutional change in government as they do not agree with their understanding of governance which has to be democratic and the free choice of the people.\n\nHe added that it was difficult to state emphatically why nearly after 20 years of democratic governance with low military interventions, there suddenly has been an upsurge.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why all that is, but my guess is that it has to do with insufficient governance, a lack of good governance, and corruption. I think that\u2019s probably the most of it. And so as you know, as I said in my opening statement, the U.S. does not support or condone these unconstitutional changes of government and the broader effect they have on democracy and the progress of democracy. But I think that corruption and a lack of good governance is probably behind much of that,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Africom Commander deflected insinuations that a contest of super powers for influence in Africa was responsible for the coups and insisted that neither China nor Russia was largely responsible for the coups except where Russia was mentioned in Sudan. Russia and China appear to be contending for influences in the continent.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou asked about the involvement of the Russians and the Chinese in these coups generally. We have not seen that \u2013 have not seen any involvement by the Chinese in any of these coups. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing that, furthering that or promoting those. With Russia, I think it\u2019s a little less clear. I think I have received reports of Russian involvement at least in Sudan in the not too distant past.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cases of violent crimes mostly tagged banditry by some governments, the AFRICOM boss said: \u201cSo I would use a different term. I think the term \u2018bandits\u2019 is the wrong term. That makes it sound like a criminal problem. And my assessment is what\u2019s expanding and causing the majority of the problem are terrorists. So I use a different term than bandits. Terrorists are expanding. We\u2019ve seen ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates expanding in West Africa from Mali into Burkina Faso, and now we\u2019re starting to see attacks in the neighbours of Ghana, Benin, Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. So, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\u201d\n\nTownsend assured that collaboration by member countries in affiliation with the United States, added to consistent dialogue and information, as well as strategy sharing would yield better and faster results in taming the spread of terrorism.\n\nOn the rising influence of China in Africa and the concerns of the United States of America, he admitted that they were expanding into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea where he suspects they want to have a naval base. He said they had some positive influences in development in the region but assured that where traps or exploitation of African partners were seen, they would raise the red flag.\n\nAccording to him, the plan to have a naval base in the Gulf of Guinea was to check piracy and illegal fishing but alleged that most of the illegal fishing activities were carried out by Chinese vessels.\n\n\u201cAnother topic that we discussed is China\u2019s role in the world. And they\u2019re a power on the rise, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d begrudge them their ability to rise as a power in the world. But they also have a view to expand into Africa, particularly into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. And where they\u2019re \u2013 where they\u2019re helping African partners in a useful and positive way, I\u2019m happy to see that and happy to see our African partners benefit from that.\n\n\u201cBut where they\u2019re exploiting our African partners, I think we ought to shine a spotlight on that. And there are some places where that is going on. And one area that concerns me is the Gulf of Guinea. The Chinese, I think, aspire to have a naval base in that area. And I think they aspire to have a maritime task force in that area, all for the purpose of preventing piracy and illegal fishing. But all the studies that I have seen say that the number one purveyor of illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea are Chinese fishing fleets. So, I think we ought to keep shining a spotlight on that kind of unhelpful involvement in the African continent,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has given an assurance that his administration remains committed to lifting the poor and vulnerable Nigerians from poverty.\n\nAccording to him, the poor and vulnerable in Nigeria remain top priority for protection and deserve lifting from the poverty cycle, noting that social safety nets would be further sustained, while access to education and opportunities would be expanded.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopian, at the virtual official presentation of the Country Review Report of Nigeria to the 31st Africa Peer Review Forum of the African Union, President Buhari said his government would also take advantage of Information, Communication and Technology to ensure inclusiveness, access and create more opportunities.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s strategic focus, as we set out to achieve the objectives of the African Union Agenda 2063, has been around the following: Building a thriving and sustainable economy; Enhancing social inclusion and alleviating poverty; enlarging agricultural output for food security and sufficiency; attaining energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products.\n\n\u201cExpanding transport and other infrastructural development, business growth, entrepreneurship and industrialisation; access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity, social cohesion and security; and, building a system that fights corruption and improves governance.\n\n\u201cNigeria remains resolutely committed to achieving these set goals despite the challenges that the report highlighted, including the COVID 19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe President reiterated that Nigeria had remained a committed and dedicated member of the African Peer Review family, after acceding to the Mechanism in 2003.\n\n\u201cToday, the forum has presented its second peer review report on Nigeria. This Second Peer Review of Nigeria came at a critical time in the history of the country. From the report just presented, there is no doubt that the exercise was far-reaching, as it touched the various segments of Nigeria\u2019s political-economy and highlighted the progress recorded since the first peer review.\n\n\u201cThe report also highlighted some challenges and as a country, we are prepared to review those challenges in the context of our internal dynamics in Nigeria, ultimately with the determination of achieving Agenda 2063 goals of the African Union,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria remains grateful to be at the esteemed Forum of the Heads of State and Government, which provides a unique opportunity to present the Country Review Reports of some countries, including Nigeria\u2019s.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me use this opportunity to commend the President of South Africa for his dedication to the Forum since his election as the Chairperson of the African Peer Review Forum.\n\n\u201cI also recognise the distinguished Panel of Eminent Persons for their continued good work in steering the African Peer Review Mechanism process in all member countries. I recognise specifically, Dr. Abdoulie Janneh who led the Review Mission to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari congratulated the other three countries (Namibia, Niger and South Africa) that were reviewed alongside Nigeria, commending the boldness and courage to present their countries for the comprehensive exercise.\n\nThe Nigerian leader called on other member states to join and present themselves for review as well.\n\n\u201cThere are so many lessons that we can all learn together. It is from learning these lessons and recommitting ourselves as a continent that we all can contribute to our collective efforts to achieve the objectives of the \u201cAfrica We Want\u201d, he further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO.

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital.

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "How changing customer attitudes will affect fintech business models in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close look at the numbers from 2021 reveals something that even casual observers must have noticed \u2014 the fintech industry keeps on pulling in the most money ($2.3 billion) of all sectors in the African tech ecosystem. In addition to that, it has significantly more startups compared to the others. Nigeria alone has 144 fintech startups, per Statista. In contrast, there are only 22 commercial banks in Nigeria.\n\nAn underdeveloped financial system, difficulty accessing credit, and a growing number of smartphone users present a huge opportunity for new and existing fintech players in Africa. However, this also means that there will be several startups offering similar services.\n\nJust like it is common to see Nigerians open accounts with more than one bank, we now see customers doing the same with fintech startups.\n\nMarking this register is another fact: these startups compete among themselves for a fraction of the market as there are still barriers to using these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparing for competition\n\nOluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, believes that fintech startups can expect to see competition from startups on the fringes of the financial services sector. This, she says, is because consumers are getting tired of having to use too many services for their financial needs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, a lot of the digital natives are becoming fatigued with the proliferation of apps, particularly with the kind of services that we have seen on the apps in recent times. And so you\u2019re beginning to find more and more organisations who are service champions who are beginning to come into financial services such as OPay and Safeboda,\u201d she said while speaking at Techpoint Build 2021 on the topic, Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintech companies?\n\nWith this increased competition for customers, Boshoro believes that fintech startups need to start offering the whole gamut of financial services rather than focusing on core banking services.\n\nCurrently, most fintech startups in Africa are focused on one financial service. This could be payments, lending, insurance, or banking. However, the same cannot be said of some of their counterparts in other sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Safeboda, for example; after launching its ride-hailing service in Ibadan, the startup has since added airtime payments to its suite of services. eCommerce giant, Jumia has done the same, launching Jumia Pay in 2016 to allow users to buy airtime, take loans, and pay for products on the platform.\n\nSo what does this mean for fintech startups?\n\nBoshoro believes that this would drive consolidation in the ecosystem as startups either get acquired by bigger players or merge to get access to a larger customer base. This is a view echoed by Abdul Hassan, CEO and Founder of Mono, in his predictions for fintech developments.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to consolidation, Boshoro believes that partnerships will become critical for survival. Companies, she says, will have to \u201cpartner with strengths as the focus to lead the market.\u201d\n\nEven with the current players in the fintech space, there is still room for more companies capable of effectively serving previously excluded groups. However, in all this, the African customer looks set to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nSince its peak in November 2021, it has lost more than 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ethereum and meme coins seeing a similar dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market\u2019s recovery, GIG Logistics (GIGL) seems to be taking a considerable risk integrating a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means users can now perform basic crypto transactions like buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nBefore the integration is made public, it will go through two beta phases. The crypto wallet will be available to 2,000 users in the first beta phase, and then 10,000 users will be onboarded in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is made possible through a collaboration with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets using cryptocurrency. XPAD users can import their wallets into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those who do not have an XPAD wallet can create one on GIGGO.\n\nWith several crypto exchanges providing similar services as XPAD, GIGGO introduces an innovative way to onboard users to the platform.\n\nWhile the crypto space has been inundated with scams since Bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use \u2014 linking XPAD, a new platform, with GIGL, a reputable company, creates a sense of trust.\n\nTo learn more about how GIGL is building a sense of trust to users, please read: Merging crypto with logistics: How GIGL is preparing for the future of payments\n\nLAMI acquires Bluewave to reach more Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLami Technology Team.\n\nDue to the traditional distribution of insurance policies by individual insurance agents, Africa has low insurance coverage. Add to this Africans relying on traditional channels for trade and policy implementation, and we\u2019ve seen customer satisfaction suffer, distribution costs rise, and the processing cycle lengthen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis then affects how premiums are paid. So, in 2018, Jihan Abass founded Lami Technologies to make insurance products available to all Kenyans.\n\nAlthough selling insurance directly can be challenging, they adopted a B2B2C strategy to capitalise on the trust that had already been established through channels that communicate with customers regularly.\n\nThrough an API, Lami enables businesses to provide digital insurance products to their users. Partner businesses can also use this to manage their insurance needs.\n\nTo make insurance coverage available to more people in Africa on a larger scale, the company has acquired Bluewave Insurance Agency for an undisclosed sum. Adelaide Odhiambo, who now works as the head of commercial partnerships at Lami, founded Bluewave Insurance, another Kenyan startup.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Bluewave has developed an online platform that enables clients to access micro-insurance products via various channels like USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lami will integrate Bluewave\u2019s technology into its core platform, enhancing its B2B2C capabilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this acquisition will allow Lami to enter new markets like Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Bluewave already has a presence. Consequently, the startup will reach more customers in these respective countries.\n\nLami, already present in Uganda and Tanzania through partnerships outside of Kenya, plans to expand into Nigeria and several North African countries in 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat are mental health difficulties and when to seek help.

He pointed to other land cases like the unresolved Osapa London that has been on since 2013, and the multiple ongoing suits involving major landowning families in Ajah.\n\n\u201cThere will be regulatory and compliance intensity, with heightened title uncertainty in high profile locations. However, technology can be expected to take center stage in the sector this year, with extremely strong prospects for growth in comfort homes, led by demand from first-time homebuyers, millennials, young families, and empty nesters\u201d he emphasised.\n\nOguniran, who is also the CEO, Eximia Realty, observed that real estate thrives off the back of strong macroeconomic fundamentals, adding that the 25 percent homeownership rate in Nigeria reflects the challenging operating environment in the country.\n\nReinforcing Ogunniran\u2019s thoughts on the emergence of increased regulatory oversight in the real estate sector, the special adviser to the Lagos State governor on housing, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, harped on the need to curb fraudulent practices and emphasised the state government\u2019s commitment to sanitising the industry.\n\n\u201cThis year is going to be different as Lagos is going to tackle fraudulent activities in the real estate sector this year. We will name and shame when the time comes because the returns on investment is unbelievable so there\u2019s no reason to defraud people,\u2019\u2019 Benson-Awoyinka said.\n\nRead also: Building sustainable growth through investment grade real estate\n\nShe said the state would, in a few weeks, conclude the foreclosure clause in its mortgage law to build investors\u2019 confidence and provide access to investments when there\u2019s a default in the mortgage payment.\n\nBenson-Awoyinka emphasised the need for individuals that want to buy land to do their due diligence and engage the services of a lawyer when purchasing properties to avoid cases of fraudulent land allocation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no clear title of land in Lagos called \u2018excision in process\u2019 as this means such land has not been allocated. You must search at the land bureau to ensure that a property has a clean title before you begin any transaction to avoid being scammed,\u201d she advised.\n\nAlso, Bisi Adeyemi, NBCC president and chairman of the council, observed that the real estate sector had become a major contributor to the country\u2019s economic growth this year.\n\n\u201cThe major objective of this event is to examine the opportunities, challenges, and, indeed, the threats in the real estate sector in 2022. The sector showed positive GDP growth in 2021 and has been identified as one of the sectors to look out for this year. We have assembled distinguished subject matter experts that will ensure we all leave here better informed,\u201d she assured.",

          "title": "How Nigerian music will beat 2021 records",
          "text": "2021 was a banner year for Afrobeats and the African music industry, with numerous chart-topping singles and albums and songs from the continent, particularly Nigeria, breaking streaming records, being nominated for, and winning both local and international awards, most notably the Grammys.\n\nHere we look at 2022, focusing on the Nigerian music industry and projections for the year.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 impacted a wide range of enterprises and industries, but it aided the expansion of consumption of Nigerian type of sound to a wider audience, thanks to the use of technology, particularly streaming services and social media.\n\nA retrospect of the Nigerian music industry in 2021\n\nWizkid\u2019s commercial success with \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d spilled over into 2021, setting new records for an afrobeat artiste. The album\u2019s deluxe edition was nominated for a Grammy award alongside other Nigerian singers who topped the global music category, including Burna Boy, who won the category in March of last year.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen foreign artistes collaborate with Nigerian artists to create great singles like the essence remix with Justin Beiber, somebody\u2019s son with Brandy, and Peru remix with Ed Sheeran, all of which have done well commercially.\n\nCkay\u2019s love nwantinti was a major hit, demonstrating the vast market for Afrobeats that has yet to be explored on a global scale. Wizkid\u2019s three-day sellout of London\u2019s O2 Arena demonstrates that the demand for Afrobeats continues to rise.\n\nAs global corporations recognize the potential of Africa\u2019s unexplored market, they are forming partnerships with labels, signing musicians, and acquiring distribution firms. Because of the popularity of Nigerian singers, global fashion brands and fintech businesses from outside are now attempting to accelerate adoption forward by striking large endorsement deals.\n\nThe Afrobeats sound and the South African Amapiano have been at the apex of musical entertainment attention and success in Africa and the world is now listening to it. The Nigerian music industry is shaping up against a healthy outlook for music sales globally.\n\nOutlook for 2022\n\nCollaborations on a global scale: Following the success of collaborations like the Essence remix with Justin Beiber and the Peru remix with Ed Sheeran last year, we can expect more international artistes to explore collaborative projects with Nigerian musicians this year. Nigerian artistes will have a greater presence on music charts as a result of this.\n\nLocal expansion moves by global companies:\n\nLast year, major music organizations such as Warner Music Group, Empire, and Fireboy DML signed Ckay, Basket Mouth, and Fireboy DML. Warner Music Group purchased a majority stake in Africori, in a move that could position Warner as Africa\u2019s top music distributor. More local expansions will happen this year allowing Africans, especially Nigerian musicians to gain access to the global music market and achieve success.\n\nMore revenue on international performances:\n\nInternational concerts and music festivals will produce more revenue for the Nigerian music business than ever before. This means that the number of local artistes traveling will increase. An example of such an event is Burna Boy who will be the first African singer to perform at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 2022.\n\nBecause New York is the world\u2019s media and brand capital, this event is demonstrating to the rest of the world that African music is here, that we have a vast audience, and that doing business with Africa is essential if you want to make an impact on future generations.\n\nAforbeats soundtrack features on Hollywood and copyright licensing:\n\nThe Netflix movie, \u2018the harder they fall\u2019 was one of the two biggest Netflix movies of 2021. In the movie, the late Fela Kuti sound was heard in the background playing. Coming to America 2 also featured Davido playing some of his hits in the movie. This seems to be the beginning of such trends as experts predict more blockbuster movies adapting Afrobeat sound to the big screens with examples like Black Panther 2 which has that African feel and is scheduled for release in November 2022.\n\nDayo Adedeji, a Twitter influencer popularly known as Dynasty, speaking with BusinessDay said, \u201cRecently there seems to be responsiveness infusing afro sounds to movies especially movies that represent black culture, although they forget that the African culture is also part of the black culture and they neglected that for a very long time. We can see that they\u2019ve started appreciating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn copyright issues,\u201d he continued, \u201call they have to do is to sign an agreement with music distribution companies. I think they will handle part of the distribution, introducing them to the foreign space too and getting the new Afro sound in their movies in return. In the future, we\u2019ll see that not just brands but movies will be appreciating the African culture more or will be infusing afro sounds more. We\u2019ll see more movie music distribution companies come in,\u201d Adedeji added.\n\nPrecious Nwadike, a legal practitioner of data privacy and data protection in an interview with BusinessDay said, \u201cNigeria is the fulcrum when it comes to African creativity. Recently there have been a lot of collaborations with industries in other continents and in Africa as well. There is going to be a massive increase in the use of copyright licenses in the copyright space for Nigerian music,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said proper awareness for artistes should be vital because many of them don\u2019t know these things and they should know the full extent of these creative rights.\n\n\u201cProvided that these movies are using the creative work of these artistes, they are getting copyright-licenses there is no issue,\u201d she concluded.\n\nMore global award category recognition/nomination:\n\nAfrica is dominating the Grammys\u2019 Global Music category, with Wizkid, Tems, Burna Boy, Femi Kuti, and Made Kuti all receiving nominations. Experts predict that Made Kuti, who creates contemporary Afrobeat music, would be a regular nominee for this category, and that with the growing consumption of Afrobeats in the global market, Afrobeat songs may break into the larger categories, which will be historical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be an African, the ceiling of the format has been breached now, so it\u2019s about time for a lot of people to rush in,\u201d Motolani Alake, a music journalist, said in an interview regarding Grammy nominations.\n\nRead also: 7 ways Nigerian music industry would beat 2021 records\n\nMore endorsements by foreign brands:\n\nWith brands like Puma and Tommy Hilfiger endorsing Nigerian artistes, we may expect more international partnership arrangements in the future, as these artistes are now considered as untapped brands by other big firms looking to invest in the African market.\n\nMusic NFTs and the Metaverse:\n\nOn new year day, 2022 Nigerian music artiste, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju announced on his Instagram page the launch of the Non-fungible token (NFT) music collection on the metaverse community, a project he named\u2018 Heads by Buju\u2019.\n\nThis is a trend we\u2019ll certainly witness in 2022 if the NFT market reaches its global high, as creative artistes begin to use the platform to generate millions of dollars without the help of music labels or distributors. More NFT collaborations will occur, and more artistes will create and own their own items rather than collaborating with another corporation.\n\n\u201cWith this momentum being experienced in the African music community, as well as the increased resources being channeled to the continent in 2022 by various industry players, I don\u2019t see any decline for African music in the near future,\u201d Jason Johnson, a professor at the School of Global Journalism and Communication said in a publication.\n\n\u201cRather, 2022 promises to be much more exciting and we should prepare to experience the best of times from the African music industry,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarr. Olayiwola Afolabi is an indigene of Ekiti State. He grew up in Lagos State but now plies his trade as a lawyer as well as a notary public with positive bias for human rights activism in Benin City, capital of Edo State.\n\nHis name resonates not only in Edo State but across Nigeria because of a charitable heart that is a critical component of his legal practice and life in general. At the end of the day, he has ended up doing so much to uplift the legal profession and the judiciary. How?\n\nFor instance, he has an award scheme for honouring honest, disciplined and diligent junior staff of Edo State judiciary. Messrs Akpitoyim, Isibor and Johnson Aneto, among others, have won this award since 2010 till date. Each one of them went home with gifts of deep freezers and bags of rice.\n\nIcons of the bench and bar have equally been honoured by Olayiwola Afolabi in one way or the other. On September 10, 2016 the incumbent Chief Judge of Edo State, Justice Esohe Ikponmwen, was given the rare privilege of cutting the tape to officially open his house on Yoruba Street, Benin City.\n\nIn 2018, Olayiwola Afolabi hosted the new executive members of NBA, Edo State Chapter to a dinner. On the occasion, he made a profound declaration. He said: \u201dI want to tell lawyers to read\u2026\u2026. Lawyers should read their books and also read their bibles because it is God that will help you.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chapter\u2019s NBA chairman \u2013 Barr Collins Ogiegbaen- thanked Olayiwola Afolabi for his immense support to the Edo NBA executive and his act of mentoring young lawyers in and out of his chambers.\n\nIn 2020, Olayiwola Afolabi officially institutionalized this mentoring process with the establishment of AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES. During the second edition of this initiative, Olayiwola Afolabi honoured Barr Austin Alegie, former NBA chairman of Edo State Branch for his dogged war to stamp out fake lawyers in the state. Also, he organised a reception for the Lion Bar of Edo NBA at the event.\n\nBesides mentoring young lawyers to hone their skills, Olayiwola Afolabi donates gifts to them that enhance their practice. Specifically, he has given out countless numbers of wigs and gowns to the best graduating students of the law faculties of UNIBEN and AAU, Ekpoma as at 2020.\n\nIn May 2021, during the outgone year, Olayiwola Afolabi again gifted wigs and gowns to three female AAU students in honour of and support for the Justice Esther Edigin Foundation set up by then Chief Judge of Edo State to empower female lawyers.\n\nOlayiwola Afolabi also gave each one of them half a bag of rice since in these hard times lawyers don\u2019t live on wigs and gowns alone. They also need some stomach infrastructure.\n\nFour months later in September 2021 at the event to mark the second edition of OLAYIWOLA AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES, Afolabi again donated wigs and gowns to several young lawyers.\n\nTo round up the year 2021, Olayiwola Afolabi was at the valedictory court session held in honour of retiring Justice Stephen Omonuwa at Edo High Court Complex on December 14, 2012. He spoke glowingly of the retiree: \u201cJustice Omonuwa is an asset to Edo State Judiciary. When people say Edo State judiciary is one of the best in Nigeria, it is because you have people like Justice Omonuwa in mind. Whether you are his brother or friend, he will always give fair judgement. He doesn\u2019t care. What he knows is justice\u201d.\n\nAlso in line with his tradition of honouring icons in the judiciary, Olayiwola Afolabi has instituted Stephen Omonuwa Transparency Award. It will go to the winner of an essay competition open only to young lawyers. The award has a prize tag of N100,000.\n\nBy locus, Afolabi is a member of Oredo LGA Branch of NBA in Edo State, In July 2016, he threw a party for its members to honour them for contributing to the development of the judiciary and Edo State.\n\nAll former chief judges and attorney-generals of the state attended the event. Indeed, charity should find resonance at home, also.\n\nMuch more, Olayiwola Afolabi is a human rights activist who is allergic to injustice whether in the bar, bench or judiciary. In 2013, he embarked on a solo campaign which resulted in official vehicles being given to magistrates, customary court judges and judges of high courts in Edo State to enhance their dignity, safety, security and performance.\n\n2016 was a busy year for his human rights/legal activism. During this year, Olayiwola Afolabi embarked on a one-man protest march at Edo High Court and Ministry of Justice premises. He called on Edo State Government to pay the over 8 months salary arrears of about 2000. JUSUN staff in the state seized because they embarked on strike demanding financial autonomy for Edo Judiciary as affirmed by a high court ruling. Also, in the same year, Olayiwola Afolabi queried Edo State Government for unexplained delay in paying the June salaries of magistrates in the state. His action brought their silent plight to the public domain resulting in the government quickly paying the wages. Similarly, Olayiwola Afolabi fought to ensure lawyers in Edo State judiciary were sponsored to the 2016 Annual General Meeting/ Conference of the NBA when the state government was not in the mood to do so.\n\nLest one forgets, but for Olayiwola Afolabi in 2016 one wonders if Edo State Government would have been stampeded into paying the terminal benefits of retired Justices Isibor and Aigboke neglected vindictively by government earlier on.\n\n2022 is still young. Nevertheless Olayiwola Afolabi has continued with his charitable gestures. At the 85th birthday of Dr. Kola Okeaya-Inneh in Benin, Olayiwola Afolabi donated two wigs and gowns in honour of the celebrant and Yakubu Maikyau (SAN) aspiring to be NBA next president. Ooops, Olayiwola Afolabi never tires in up lifting the bar, bench and judiciary. That is the gospel truth.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMichael A.

          "text": "Despite the clampdown by the Rivers State government and the 23 local government areas of the state, illegal refining and bunkering are going on in the state.\n\nLEADERSHIP observed that movement of illegally refined petroleum products usually occurs at nights.\n\nIt was further observed that those involved in the illegal business work in connivance with security operatives who provide cover for them.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent in Port Harcourt, a retired assistant commissioner of police, Dr. Uche Mike Chukwuma, said the business had been flourishing because of involvement of security operatives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cThis kpofire thing we are talking about, frankly speaking, it has been flourishing because security agencies from the federal establishments as it were, have been aiding and abetting them all these while. They have not carried every other person along.\u201d\n\nA native of Oyigbo in Oyigbo local government area of the state, Innocent Ajaelu, said to eradicate illegal refineries and circulation of illegally refined petroleum products, the state government needs to go beyond destruction of the illegal refineries and storage facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want the government to go beyond destroying properties of the illegal refiners. Government should go out to look for their sponsors and those that have been benefitting from it.\n\n\u201cYou know that people have invested in that business. Let it not be that after a while, they will come back to the business and continue polluting our environment.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has cautioned traditional rulers in the state against allowing illegal oil bunkering and artisanal refinery activities in their domain.\n\nThe governor, who reiterated his resolve to sustain the war against illegal oil bunkering and artisanal refining activities specifically warned the traditional rulers of Akpor Kingdom in Obio/Akpor local government arearea and Omerelu in Ikwerre community in Ikwerre local government area, respectively not to allow such activities to thrive anymore in their respective domain.\n\nWike spoke yesterday during the presentation of staff of office and certificate of recognition to Nne-Nwe-Eli Emohua XIII (OLO IV), Ohna Sergeant Chidi Awuse and Nye Nwe Ali Akpor, Eze Ozuowuowu Levi Amos Orlu Oriebe at Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nBoth Nne-Nwe-eli Emohua XIII (OLO IV) and Nye Nwe Ali Akpor are first class stools in Emohua and Obio/Akpor local government areas respectively.\n\nHe said the state government would not hesitate to depose the King of Akpor kingdom if illegal oil bunkering continues in Rumuokparali and Ogbogoro communities.\n\nThe governor also frowned at the king of Omerelu community in Ikwerre local government area where illegal oil bunkering activities are thriving.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike said: \u201cAside the soot problem and economic sabotage associated with the criminal activities, the internal roads being reconstructed by his administration in Omerelu are damaged.\n\n\u201cWe are doing internal roads in Omerelu. This is a community that has been crying for roads and we have given them not less than 11/12 kilometers of internal roads, and now they\u2019re spoiling it because of the conveying of the products. We can\u2019t continue to accept that. I can\u2019t understand why you just want to collect the chieftaincy title and do nothing.\u201d\n\nThe governor told the two kings presented with their staff of office to come to terms with the responsibilities associated with their new status and discharge them effectively.\n\nHe said they were to ensure peace prevailed in their domain by attending to all shades of conflict so that they do not snowball into crisis.\n\nWike also charged them to stop partisan politics but be willing always work in synergy with the government in order to promote governance at the grassroots.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThis your certificate of recognition comes with a lot of responsibilities. Do what you\u2019re expected. Relate with government to know what is going on. When once you alert government, you\u2019ve done your own work. But if you don\u2019t alert government, it\u2019ll be considered that you\u2019re part of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Wike said the demolition of shanties would continue because hoodlums use such places as hideouts to perpetrate their criminal activities including those found in the Government Residential Areas in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governor said the state had also recovered government properties fraudulently acquired by retired civil servants.\n\nHe said: \u201cCivil servants will retire and change documents and forge it that they had allocation twenty years ago for State government property. I am taking them back, all.\u201d",

Danladi, a career foreign civil servant to perpetrate the alleged corrupt practices.\n\nFind below the full petition:\n\n4th February 2022\n\nThe Executive Chairman\n\nEconomic and Financial Crimes Commission\n\nHeadquarters\n\nJabi\n\nAbuja\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPETITION AGAINST ILLEGAL COLLECTION OF INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT ISSUANCE FEES BY NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN, ADEMOLA SERIKI\n\nWe are constrained to bring the attention of your office on the current happenings at the Nigerian Embassy, Madrid, Spain.\n\nThe high level impunity, abuse of office being perpetrated by the ambassador which is serious drawing unnecessary diplomatic embarrassment to Nigeria in the comity of diplomatic circle in Spain.\n\nWe wish to draw your attention as parts of our cardinal duties as Nigerians to join hands with the president in weeding out corrupt and bad eggs among the foreign service officials.\n\nA circular was issued by the ambassador on 2nd July 2021 mandating passport applicants who showed up at the embassy in Madrid without appointment to pay the sum of 200euros (N130,000) equivalent in cash.\n\nSimilarly, all applicants with appointment that fail to show up are charged the sum of 20euros (12,800). These fees are all charged in cash at the embassy.\n\nAlso 500 euros (N260,000) is charged for the same day express service of passport issuance, all these going to Seriki\u2019s purse.\n\nSeriki been an accountant by profession, why must he insist on collecting cash when he clearly know the rules governing the financial transactions\n\nIs Nigerian Immigration Service \u2013 the only government agency charged with collecting passport fees privy to these fraudulent activities.\n\nNigerian immigration Service must come out clean over this scandal.

          "text": "Rev John Hayab, the Chairman of the Christian Association in Kaduna State, has expressed concern about the kidnapping of one of his members who was supposed to deliver the ransom for the release of the remaining kidnapped Bethel Baptist High School student by terrorists.\n\nHayab, who is also the Vice Chairman of CAN in the northern states and Abuja, reportedly revealed that the remaining pupil, who is said to be the youngest of the abductees, turned down the militants\u2019 offer of freedom.\n\n121 kids were kidnapped by bandits in the early hours of July 5, 2021, at the school premises along the Kaduna-Kachia highway, Damishi, in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state, according to the President of the Baptist Conference, Rev Ishaya Jangado.\n\nThe bandits had freed 120 students in groups.\n\nThe CAN chairman, on the other hand, stated that the teen opted to remain with the bandits, a situation that perplexed the entire Baptist family, as well as CAN.\n\nThe robbers were alleged to be showering the youngster with presents every time they went out and returned from operations, causing him to refuse the option of freedom, according to Hayab.\n\nThe CAN leader, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH in Kaduna on Thursday, said, \u201cOnly one pupil of the Bethel Baptist High School is remaining with the terrorists. The reason is that this young boy \u2013 because we have to be clear with the story so that we don\u2019t get misquoted \u2013 is the smallest among them.\n\n\u201cI think the kidnappers were smart. They worked and changed his mind that he even said he wants to stay with them. They (terrorists) gave him meat, good things. Anytime they go out and come back, they pick him among the rest and give him so many things and then he starts acting funny.\n\n\u201cIf they (terrorists) tell him to go home, he would say he was not going and gave some flimsy excuses that his parents used to beat him at home. But we also made findings and we don\u2019t want to expose his parents to any noise but that is what he (the pupil) said. We are confused too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I understand they (terrorists) are playing mind games with him by giving him gifts and convincing him to talk that way. But last week, they (terrorists) asked us to bring some money (ransom) to come and take him. The person who took the money to them was kidnapped. The person is with them as I speak now (on Thursday).\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a very complicated situation that we are praying and managing with care. The man who has been helping us to deliver the money (ransom) all this while went to deliver the money to free this boy they were confusing and they kidnapped him. So, the whole thing is taking a different dimension and we need to be careful.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration has been accused of withholding the names of Nigerians accused of funding Boko Haram, the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), and other terrorist organisations in the country.\n\nAccording to NEWS DIRECT, the Buhari-led government has announced the arrest of those allegedly financing terrorism and wreaking devastation across the country, notably in the Northeast.\n\nOn October 1, 2021, President Buhari said that an anonymous member of the National Assembly and other individuals were funding terrorism, including the Indigenous People of Biafra, or IPOB.\n\nDespite cries from Nigerians seeking the arrest and prosecution of the suspected financiers, DAILY POST can confirm that four months later, the names of the purported sponsors have yet to be made public.\n\nDuring a news conference in Abuja on Thursday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced that 123 firms and 96 terrorist financiers had been identified, including those supporting Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province, ISWAP.\n\nIn response, Emmanuel Onwubuko, the National Coordinator of the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, accused the Buhari administration of hiding the names of the alleged sponsors in an interview with DAILY POST on Friday.\n\nHURIWA claimed that the Federal Government is not serious about addressing insecurity in Nigeria, claiming that the government possesses Nigerians\u2019 data and should be able to find the suspected financiers.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe secrecy surrounding the unveiling of the identities of the terrorism sponsors is a pointer to the fact that some persons in government are into something that they don\u2019t want Nigerians to know. Nigerians have the right to know those who have made life very unfortunate for them for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cThe government has skeletons in its cupboard and that is why they keep violating the rights of Nigerians to know the sponsors of Boko Haram and other terrorist groups. This is why they are after radio stations and other media platforms, trying to silence the voice of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general of the federation once told Nigerians that they have compiled over 400 names of some terrorists and have charged them to court, where is that case and what is the status of that matter?\u201d, Onwubiko asked\n\nRecall that a former Police Commissioner, Emmanuel Ojukwu, had asked the federal government to stop making mere media announcements of the existence of sponsors of terrorism but have them arrested and prosecuted.\n\nWhile featuring on Channels Television on Thursday, the ex-police boss said, \u201cTo finance terrorism is a criminal offence, the laws are there, activate the legal process and get them arrested\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the FG should stop disturbing Nigerians with the news of discovery but should come up with the identities of the alleged sponsors.",

These were reported from Ondo, Bauchi, Edo, Enugu and Delta States,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIn total for 2022, 14 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 43 Local Government Areas. Of all confirmed cases, 82 per cent are from Ondo (30 per cent), Edo (27 per cent), and Bauchi (25 per cent) States.\n\n\u201cThe predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (Range:1 to 80 years, Median Age: 30 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8. The number of suspected cases has increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2021.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NCDC Reports 35 New COVID-19 Cases In Five States, FCT\n\nWhile there was no new healthcare worker reported to have been infected in reporting week 4, the NCDC said it has activated the national Lassa fever multi-partner and multi-sectoral Emergency Coordination Centre (EOC) to coordinate response activities at all levels.\n\nIt explained that it has also sent Lassa fever alert letters to states, in addition to carrying out preparedness assessment for the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAccording to the agency, the seven Lassa fever molecular laboratories in its network are working full capacity to ensure all samples are tested, and results are provided within the shortest turnaround time.\n\nIt said confirmed cases were treated at identified treatment centres across the states while risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.\n\nThe NCDC stated specifically that National Rapid Respond Teams (NRRTs) have been deployed to the FCT, as well as Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Taraba, and Benue States.\n\nLassa virus is transmitted to man by infected multi-mammate rats and humans become infected from direct contact with the urine and faeces of the rat carrying the virus.\n\nIt is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever contracted by touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to open cuts or sores.\n\nSecondary transmission from person to person can also occur as a result of exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of an infected patient.",

          "title": "US Identifies Bad Governance, Corruption as Motivations for Coups in Africa",
          "text": "The United States of America has condemned as unacceptable and out of vogue, any change of government in Africa except as constitutionally enshrined through elections and popular ballot as coups undermine democracy and development.\n\nThe US, apparently responding to the four recent coups in the continent, assured therefore that any regime which gains power through coups would not enjoy the support and recognition of the United States seen as the bastion of democracy.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Commander of the United States Africa Command, AFRICOM, General Stephen Townsend who while expressing surprise at the recent upsurge in spate of military coups in Africa, opined that bad governance and corruption may have been responsible for the putsches.\n\nIn the last 18 months, the military has seized power in Mali, Chad, Sudan and Burkina Faso.\n\nTownsend had in a virtual briefing on Thursday, where he took questions from journalists, explained that the United States frowns at irregular or unconstitutional change in government as they do not agree with their understanding of governance which has to be democratic and the free choice of the people.\n\nHe added that it was difficult to state emphatically why nearly after 20 years of democratic governance with low military interventions, there suddenly has been an upsurge.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why all that is, but my guess is that it has to do with insufficient governance, a lack of good governance, and corruption. I think that\u2019s probably the most of it. And so as you know, as I said in my opening statement, the U.S. does not support or condone these unconstitutional changes of government and the broader effect they have on democracy and the progress of democracy. But I think that corruption and a lack of good governance is probably behind much of that,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Africom Commander deflected insinuations that a contest of super powers for influence in Africa was responsible for the coups and insisted that neither China nor Russia was largely responsible for the coups except where Russia was mentioned in Sudan. Russia and China appear to be contending for influences in the continent.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou asked about the involvement of the Russians and the Chinese in these coups generally. We have not seen that \u2013 have not seen any involvement by the Chinese in any of these coups. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing that, furthering that or promoting those. With Russia, I think it\u2019s a little less clear. I think I have received reports of Russian involvement at least in Sudan in the not too distant past.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cases of violent crimes mostly tagged banditry by some governments, the AFRICOM boss said: \u201cSo I would use a different term. I think the term \u2018bandits\u2019 is the wrong term. That makes it sound like a criminal problem. And my assessment is what\u2019s expanding and causing the majority of the problem are terrorists. So I use a different term than bandits. Terrorists are expanding. We\u2019ve seen ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates expanding in West Africa from Mali into Burkina Faso, and now we\u2019re starting to see attacks in the neighbours of Ghana, Benin, Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. So, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\u201d\n\nTownsend assured that collaboration by member countries in affiliation with the United States, added to consistent dialogue and information, as well as strategy sharing would yield better and faster results in taming the spread of terrorism.\n\nOn the rising influence of China in Africa and the concerns of the United States of America, he admitted that they were expanding into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea where he suspects they want to have a naval base. He said they had some positive influences in development in the region but assured that where traps or exploitation of African partners were seen, they would raise the red flag.\n\nAccording to him, the plan to have a naval base in the Gulf of Guinea was to check piracy and illegal fishing but alleged that most of the illegal fishing activities were carried out by Chinese vessels.\n\n\u201cAnother topic that we discussed is China\u2019s role in the world. And they\u2019re a power on the rise, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d begrudge them their ability to rise as a power in the world. But they also have a view to expand into Africa, particularly into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. And where they\u2019re \u2013 where they\u2019re helping African partners in a useful and positive way, I\u2019m happy to see that and happy to see our African partners benefit from that.\n\n\u201cBut where they\u2019re exploiting our African partners, I think we ought to shine a spotlight on that. And there are some places where that is going on. And one area that concerns me is the Gulf of Guinea. The Chinese, I think, aspire to have a naval base in that area. And I think they aspire to have a maritime task force in that area, all for the purpose of preventing piracy and illegal fishing. But all the studies that I have seen say that the number one purveyor of illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea are Chinese fishing fleets. So, I think we ought to keep shining a spotlight on that kind of unhelpful involvement in the African continent,\u201d he explained.\n\nAhamefula Ogbu",

This Second Peer Review of Nigeria came at a critical time in the history of the country. From the report just presented, there is no doubt that the exercise was far-reaching, as it touched the various segments of Nigeria\u2019s political-economy and highlighted the progress recorded since the first peer review.\n\n\u201cThe report also highlighted some challenges and as a country, we are prepared to review those challenges in the context of our internal dynamics in Nigeria, ultimately with the determination of achieving Agenda 2063 goals of the African Union,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria remains grateful to be at the esteemed Forum of the Heads of State and Government, which provides a unique opportunity to present the Country Review Reports of some countries, including Nigeria\u2019s.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me use this opportunity to commend the President of South Africa for his dedication to the Forum since his election as the Chairperson of the African Peer Review Forum.\n\n\u201cI also recognise the distinguished Panel of Eminent Persons for their continued good work in steering the African Peer Review Mechanism process in all member countries. I recognise specifically, Dr. Abdoulie Janneh who led the Review Mission to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari congratulated the other three countries (Namibia, Niger and South Africa) that were reviewed alongside Nigeria, commending the boldness and courage to present their countries for the comprehensive exercise.\n\nThe Nigerian leader called on other member states to join and present themselves for review as well.\n\n\u201cThere are so many lessons that we can all learn together. It is from learning these lessons and recommitting ourselves as a continent that we all can contribute to our collective efforts to achieve the objectives of the \u201cAfrica We Want\u201d, he further said.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s daily power generation has fallen by an alarming 630 megawatts (MW) since Wednesday following a fire outbreak at Egbin Power Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos State and the resultant shut down of generation by the company.\n\nThis development, coupled with the load reduction mechanism adopted by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to prevent system collapse, has worsened the power supply situation in Lagos State. Electricity consumers in the state and its environs have been witnessing constant power outages for several weeks.\n\nEgbin Power had, in a statement issued to its stakeholders and the general public friday, reported the fire incident at its power plant on Wednesday, February 2, 2022, at about 4.20pm, leading to blackout in Lagos State.\n\nThe thermal plant has an installed capacity of 1,320MW consisting of six turbines of 220MW each, while its actual average generating capacity is about 800MW.\n\nEgbin said the fire outbreak was successfully contained by a team of its firefighters in collaboration with firefighters from the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) in Egbin.\n\nThe company said it had set out a process to determine the cause of the fire incident as it had temporarily suspended its operations in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures.\n\n\u201cEgbin has since activated its emergency response mechanism to determine the cause of the incident, while operations at the plant have been temporarily suspended in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures. Egbin is also working with the Federal Fire Service, the Federal Ministry of Power and other stakeholders to review the incident,\u201d the management of the power plant said in the statement.\n\nConfirming the fire incident and its technical implications, TCN\u2019s spokesperson, Mrs. Ndidi Mba, told THISDAY yesterday that it had led to the removal of a total of 630MW from the national grid.\n\nMba said, \u201cWe know that there was a fire outbreak and the total generation of 630MW was removed from the grid because of that.\n\n\u201cYou know, when a fire outbreak happens, even if it doesn\u2019t affect the entire units, the tendency is that, to protect the other ones, you shut them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, 630mw was removed from the grid on that day (Wednesday).\u201d\n\nNigeria generates an average of 8,000mw of electricity daily, out of the installed 13,800mw capacity, transmits an average of 5,000mw, while distribution hovers between 3,000 and 2,500mw.\n\nMeanwhile, electricity consumers in Lagos and its environs have recently been witnessing constant power outages.\n\nThe two distribution companies serving Lagos \u2013 Ikeja Electric (IE) and Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) -attributed the outages under their networks to a drop in power generation in the country.\n\nIn a recent statement for its customers, IE blamed the power outage experienced in certain parts of its network on load shedding by the TCN as a result of a drop in power generation.\n\nEKEDC had also attributed the reduction in supply to the drop in power generation from an average of 3,700MW to 2,000MW.\n\nThe Disco said this was caused by gas limitations arising from vandalism and more recently an issue affecting the TCN line from the Egbin Power Plant.\n\nExplaining the constant power outages in Lagos State in recent times, the TCN spokesperson stated that the state was a high consumption area and that the agency had to reduce the load to avoid overloading 330kv lines within the state and to achieve load balance.\n\nMeanwhile, Egbin has assured the public that its technical team is working assiduously to restore operations.\n\n\u201cAs the foremost power plant in the nation, Egbin remains committed to providing power innovatively and responsibly in compliance with good health, safety and environmental standards,\u201d she added.\n\nPeter Uzoho",
