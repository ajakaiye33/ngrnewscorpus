          "title": "Over 50,000 police, NSCDC, army deployed to tighten security",
          "text": "Over 50,000 security agents, comprising police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and the army have been deployed in Anambra State to ensure the smooth conduct of the governorship election which holds today.\n\nGiven the apprehension that surrounded the election and the now cancelled sit-at-home order imposed by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, the police said it had deployed 34,587 personnel while the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps deployed 20,000 personnel. The number of soldiers deployed by the army was however not disclosed.\n\nIPOB had threatened to re-impose its sit-at-home order for one week, starting from Friday but it cancelled the order on Thursday, citing the intervention by elders, traditional and religious leaders in the region.\n\nThe Commandant General of the NSCDC, Dr Ahmed Audi, said on Friday that the deployment was to forestall attacks on voters and ensure a hitch-free electoral process.\n\nSpeaking during a situational assessment visit to Anambra State ahead of the poll, Audi also cautioned security operatives against excessive use of force during the election.\n\nThis was contained in a statement on Friday by the NSCDC spokesman, Olusola Odumosu, titled, \u2018Anambra election: NSCDC boss reads the Riot Act to personnel on election duty.\u2019\n\nThe NSCDC boss expressed confidence in INEC and all stakeholders involved in the election, adding that corps would work with other agencies to forestall any form of attack on voters, INEC staff, security agencies and sensitive and non-sensitive election materials.\n\nHe stressed that the personnel on election duty must strictly adhere to the rules of engagement and observe \u201cthe highest level of professionalism, civility, decorum and respect for the rights of all voters.\u201d\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cDr Audi warned the personnel to be civil in their approach and avoid excessive use of force, molestation, intimidation or harassment of voters during the election.\u201d\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, also said on Thursday in Abuja that police deployment would consist of conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force, the Counter- Terrorism Unit, Special Forces, Explosive Ordnance Unit, Force Intelligence Bureau, INTERPOL, Special Protection Unit and a medical team.\n\nHe said three helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance while detachments of marine police operatives would also be deployed to ensure safe and credible electoral process.\n\nThe IGP said the deployment followed the outcome of election security threat analysis conducted by the Force Intelligence Bureau, adding that, \u201cBased on the outcome of the analysis, we have developed a strategic election security operation plan which will involve the mobilisation of 34,587 police personnel.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to assure all citizens and stakeholders, including the international community of our determination to work with other security agencies to stabilise the prevailing situation in Anambra. The idea is to create a conducive and enabling environment that will guarantee peaceful conduct of the election.\u201d\n\nThe President had ordered massive deployment of security agents in the state to ensure a peaceful poll.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place, if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies,\u201d the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, said after a meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja on October 22.\n\nSimilarly, Okoye pointed out that seven Resident Electoral Commissioners were deployed in the state and that they would handle three local governments each, while three National Commissioners were also deployed to supervise the exercise.\n\nHe also promised that the votes of eligible Anambra people would be the only determinant of who becomes the next governor of the state.\n\nINEC chair warns staff, says all eyes on us\n\nAlso, INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has warned the staff members of the commission participating in the election against any misconduct, saying all eyes are on the commission to deliver a credible poll.\n\nIn his message to the staff members on Friday, he charged them to ensure that every vote counts.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs you are aware, Nigerians expect the Anambra governorship election to be an improvement on the high standards achieved in recent elections. That was why we introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System for fingerprint and facial biometric authentication of voters. We have trained the staff in the use of the new technology.\n\n\u201cWe have also delivered all sensitive and non-sensitive materials for the election on schedule, deployed election duty staff and made logistics arrangements to move personnel and materials to thousands of locations in Anambra State where voting and collation of results will take place.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative for all of you to ensure that every single vote counts. You must remain true to our commitment that only the voters in Anambra State determine who becomes the next governor of the state.\u201d\n\nHe urged the workers to be guided by the extant laws, guidelines, regulations and good conscience, adding that they should also be vigilant, principled and committed to the vision and mission of the commission.\n\nResidents desert streets\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the state stayed away from the streets and their places of business on Friday in compliance with IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home order even though the body had cancelled the order and urged residents to go about their lawful activities as well as cast their vote on Saturday.\n\nFrom the state capital, Awka, to Onitsha and to Ekwulobia, the story was the same as the streets were deserted. The residents, our correspondents gathered, stayed at home to avoid risking their lives. Some others said they were aware of the cancellation of the order but stressed that it was better to stay at home and monitor the situation given past experiences.\n\nFrom Ekwulobia roundabout to Ekwulobia-Uga-Orlu Road, Ekwulobia-Oko-Umunze Road, Ekwulobia-Awka Road and Ekwulobia-Isuofia-Nnewi Road, all the roads were deserted except for few commercial motorcycle riders who seized the opportunity to make brisk business. Eke Ekwulobia Market, shops, filing stations, food joints were also closed.\n\nSome residents of Ekwulobia told Saturday PUNCH that the sit-at-home order would affect the election on Saturday, despite the fact that it had been cancelled.\n\nA resident, Cletus Obiagu, said, \u201cPeople are observing the sit-at-home order because no one wants to lose their life. The only way the order will not affect the election, despite its cancellation, is for the government to use the media, especially the social media, to keep announcing the cancellation of the order.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, many people had to buy enough household and food items to sustain them for the initial one week sit-at-home order. That explains why the streets were deserted, save for the security agents that are on patrol. All the transport companies here in Ekwulobia also shut down their parks in compliance with the sit-at-home order.\u201d\n\nMrs Charity Ezeokafor, who opened her shop in front of her house, said she did so because her son called her on Friday morning that IPOB had cancelled sit-at-home order.\n\nAnother resident, Nkechi Onuh, said she was ready to vote if the environment was safe.\n\nIn Awka, most of the offices did not open for business, while the roads were also deserted for most part of the day. However, few cars, commercial buses and tricycles were seen on the major roads while food vendors were also seen doing their business.\n\nAt the Regina and Aroma junctions along the Onitsha\u2013Enugu Road, few shops that sold perishable goods were open for business but experienced low patronage. Commuters were seen boarding the few available buses while food vendors were seen on the popular Regina Caeli Road.\n\nThe highway was also deserted and the situation did not improve later in the day as Saturday PUNCH gathered that most people had left for areas where they would vote on Saturday.\n\nA lady, who simply identified herself as Uloma, said she did not leave her house because of the fear of being attacked. She said, \u201cYou can see that I have decided to sit in front of my house because I don\u2019t want to have any problem with IPOB or the police. I heard the sit-at-home order was cancelled but I decided to stay at home because no one is sure of what will happen.\n\n\u201cI am also afraid that this situation will affect the election though IPOB has also urged people to go out to cast their vote.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Public Affairs Officer of INEC in the state, Reginald Onyeukwu, allayed fears that the election might witness severe voter apathy given what was witnessed on Friday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe fact that people stayed at home on Friday does not mean they will not come out to vote on Saturday. It will surely not have a negative impact on the election.\n\n\u201cINEC is fully prepared and IPOB is no longer after the disruption of the election but I understand that people are still afraid. We are telling them not to be afraid. We are telling the voters to come out and exercise their right.\u201d\n\nResidents fear heavily armed policeman\n\nDespite the fact that the police and other security outfits are in Anambra to ensure a peaceful election, some people told Saturday PUNCH they were afraid of the heavy deployment.\n\nA resident, Gloria Ume, said, \u201cThe last time personnel of the Department of State Services were killed at the Ekwulobia junction, the security operatives came later and were shooting indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cA girl of about 15years was shot dead because she tried to record the indiscriminate shooting by the security operatives. And most of the soldiers were chanting Alllau akbar.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Chinecheremu Ezeh, corroborated what Ume said, adding, \u201cPeople are afraid of security operatives because they are so hostile, probably because of the briefing they had before they were posted. They see everyone as an IPOB member that should be killed.\u201d\n\nCSO slams redeployment of police officers\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room has said the frequent redeployment of police personnel is inimical to the poll.\n\nThe group was reacting to the redeployment of the Deputy Inspector-General of police, Joseph Egbunike, as the head of the special police team providing security for the election.\n\nThe NCSSR Convener, Ene Obi, said the state had had six Commissioners of Police in past six months.\n\nShe added, \u201cThis state has been a bit notorious in terms of police deployment. I remember we were on the ground a month ago when we had a meeting with the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere has been six CPs in Anambra State in six months. What is going on? Only the AIG and IGP can tell us why they are deploying and redeploying at this last minute. This same DIG that addressed people at Ekwulobia on Wednesday is ironically from this state, we don\u2019t really know what is going on.\u201d\n\nObiano requests early voters\u2019 turnout\n\nThe Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, has requested registered voters in Anambra to turn out not only in large numbers for the Saturday governorship election in the state but to do so early.\n\nHis call was contained in a press statement signed by Anambra Commissioner for Information & Public Enlightenment, Mr Don Adinuba.\n\nThe governor explained that an early turnout had become necessary because voting would close at 2.30pm and anyone who did not stand in line before the time would not vote.\n\nThe statement noted that about two 2.5 million people registered for the election in which 18 political partieswould participate.\n\nObiano assured the people that the voting would be peaceful, free and fair and urged them to come out in their numbers.\n\nIgbo leaders request peaceful election\n\nAlso, some stakeholders in Igbo land have called on the electorate and political actors to show electoral maturity.\n\nThe call was made in a press statement, made available to one of our correspondents by Mr Ikechukwu Okafor, a media aide of the former Aviation minister, Chief Osita Chidoka, on Friday in Awka.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe former Aviation minister, Chief Osita Chidoka; Minority Leader of the Senate, Sen. Enyinnaya Abaribe, and a Law Professor and activist, Dr Sam Amadi, have called for a peaceful conduct of the election.\u201d\n\nThe trio insisted that the agitation of the South-East \u201cis better realised when the movement participates in the political process and throws up political leaders who share the vision and aspiration of the people.as election boycott will destroy that possibility.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWhen the people elect a leadership that represents their hopes and aspirations, they are in a position to pursue the people\u2019s agenda more effectively. Whatever is the plan, it has to go through a political process.\n\n\u201cIf you have governors and legislators who share in the vision you agitate for, it would be easier to realise such vision.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Collapsed building: Osinbajo to sue Sahara Reporters over ownership claims",
          "text": "Following a recent article by an online news platform, Sahara Reporters, linking Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to the Ikoyi high-rise building which collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos on November 1, 2021, the Vice President has debunked the claims and referred the publication to his lawyers for legal action.\n\nThis is as he condoled with the families of those affected by the mishap.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this on Friday in a statement titled, \u2018Ikoyi high-rise building collapse: Osinbajo saddened, condoles with affected families, debunks despicable lies in sponsored online report\u2019.\n\nAkande revealed that Osinbajo is saddened by the events that occurred in Lagos on Monday, November 1, 2021, where a high-rise building under construction on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, collapsed.\n\nHe said the Vice President extended his condolence to the families and relatives of the deceased and those injured or affected in one way or the other as a result of the incident.\n\nThe statement also disclosed that the attention of the Vice President had been drawn to \u201can obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building published by Sahara Reporters on November 4, 2021, to the effect that:\n\n\u201cThe VP owns the land upon which the collapsed building in Ikoyi stood. That the said land was sold to him by Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, Chairman of Elizade Motors; and that the Vice President, at some point, intervened with the regulatory authorities in Lagos State to unseal the said property.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter. All property and assets owned by the Vice President have been publicly declared.\n\nThe media aide also said that Osinbajo has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State. The Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies,\u201d Akande revealed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced the scrapping of civil authority.\n\nThe takeover happened after elite soldiers in Guinea, headed by Col Mamady Doumbouya, overthrew President Alpha Conde in September. Ousted Conde formed, trained and armed them.\n\nIn Mali, the military removed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in August 2020.

Both are popular and the identities of other seven are concealed.\n\nThe Ethiopian capital could fall in a matter of weeks as the county enters the third day of a state of emergency, calling on the people to pick up arms.\n\nOn Friday, the Defence Ministry commenced moves to boost the strength of armed forces, urging veterans to re-enlist after two towns fell to rebels.\n\nIn July, hundreds of government soldiers captured by Tigray Defense Forces during a battle were marched into Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has faulted the claim by the 36 State governments that the planned deduction of $418million to settle debts arising from the Paris Club refund was unlawful.\n\nThe FG claimed the debt arose from contracts willfully entered by the States and Local Government, which resulted in litigations and judgments given in favour of the consultants engaged by them.\n\nIn a statement issued late on Friday by Umar Gwandu, the media aide to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, the Federal Government claimed to have given funds to the States and Local Governments, between 2016 and 2018, to defray consultancy fees and related expenses incurred by them.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe FG, whose statement was issued in reaction to the interim restraining orders obtained by the States on Friday against it and its agents, wondered why the same States and LGs, that had paid part of the Paris Club refund debt to the same consultants were now opposed to its move for final settlement of the outstanding debt.\n\nIt reads: \u201cIt is remarkable to note that the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) at various times in 2016 and 2018 received payments from the Federal Government under the guise of legal and consultancy fees related to the same Paris Club refunds.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, NGF was paid US$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and US$100,000,000.00 in 2018. It was however, convenient at that time not to complain about payment of consultants,\u201d the FG said.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt can be noticed that some reports contain wilful statements suggesting that some government officers were acting without due process in the settlement of certain judgment debts (totalling US$418million) arising from the deduction and refunds due to the States and Local Governments from the Paris Club loan refunds.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIt is important and necessary to state, at the onset, that the deductions were on account of four judgments in contention which were delivered at various times in 2014, 2015, 2017 & 2019.\n\n\u201cTwo of these judgments were consent judgments based on terms of settlement entered into by NGF in 2017 & 2019. Again, two of the four judgments were based on an earlier judgment delivered by the Federal High Court in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, amazing that from 2013 \u2013 2021 neither NGF nor ALGON deemed it fit to either challenge or fully comply with any of these judgments. In furtherance of the consent and settlement the NGF itself made payments in billions to the consultants based on the same judgment it is deriding now.\n\n\u201cBy various letters addressed to the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Honourable Minister of Finance, both NGF and ALGON expressed no objection and actually recommended the same set of consultants for payment.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the judgement debts were much higher than the above figure, but these officers ensured that the consultants granted consistent concessional offer.\n\n\u201cThe office of the HAGF also subjected the claims of the consultants/contractors to investigations by both the DSS and EFCC in order to further ascertain the veracity of the claims. Recommendations for payment were thus made based on the positive outcomes of these investigations.\n\n\u201cSince both NGF and ALGON that have entered into judicial settlement on account of which consent judgment was entered have refused to comply with these judgments, it became pertinent for the Federal Government to take the initiative in order to prevent a situation where the debt liability of NGF and ALGON would be transferred to the Federal Government and eventually excluded against its assets and interest.\n\n\u201cThe interest of the Federal Government to intervene in the negotiated settlement was borne out of the fact that the Consultants made Federal Government a party to the action against NGF and ALGON the implication of which was that the judgment may be executed against the interest and assets of the Federal Government over liability that was incurred exclusively by NGF and ALGON in respect of which the Federal Government is not responsible.\n\n\u201cIt is curious to note that both NGF and ALGON who had actual knowledge of these judgments between 2013 and 2019, consented to their partial compliance and also undertook in 2019 to settle them from their FAAC Allocations, only turned around in 2021 to take steps to challenge the judgments.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government acted on the undertaking/indemnity provided by NGF. More so, the judgment creditors also obtained orders of mandamus compelling the issuance of the promissory notes.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable to note that the NGF at various times in 2016 and 2018 received payments from the Federal Government under the guise of legal and consultancy fees related to the same Paris Club refunds.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, NGF was paid US$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and US$100,000,000.00 in 2018. It was however, convenient at that time not to complain about payment of consultants.\n\n\u201cThus, the Federal Government did not act in vacuum before the decision to comply with the existing judgments was taken.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government could not fold its arms and watch while the consultants/contractors had already obtained garnishee order absolute attaching the funds of the Federal Government in the Central Bank of Nigeria on account of the fact that the refunds of the Paris Club loans were made by the Federal Government to the States and Local Governments in contempt of an existing court judgments procured against NGF and ALGON by consent.\n\n\u201cThus, the Federal Government did not resort to arbitrary deductions of funds belonging to States and Local Governments rather it is in furtherance of the need to settle judgment debts judiciously consented to by NGF and ALGON that were incurred but in respect of which they are seeking to transfer the liability of same to the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThus, the media onslaught on what played out at FAAC October meeting that States won\u2019t be able to pay salaries on account of the deductions is far from the truth as the problem is self-induced being a product of contractual negotiation in respect of which NGF and ALGON submitted to judicial decision legitimately entered by their consent.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney General of the Federation denies any wrongdoing in the steps that have been taken so far to comply with the various court judgments and is also not party or privy to any of the sinister agenda or plots being insinuated in the malicious publications, but maintains that he has a responsibility to protect Federal Government from bearing liability of a judgement debt incurred by Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and ALGON which is mischievously being transferred to the Federal Government.\u201d",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has declared three days of mourning over the Ikoyi building collapse. All flags are to be flown at half-mast in public and private buildings and official engagements cancelled during the period.\n\nThis came as Governor Sanwo-Olu signed the executive order giving legal backing to the panel of inquiry set up to probe the collapsed building.\n\nHe inaugurated the panel at the Five Cowries Boat Terminal of the Lagos State Water Authority (LASWA) on Falomo Road, Ikoyi, yesterday, with a charge to get to the root of the building collapse.\n\nThe governor charged the panel chaired by Mr. Toyin Ayinde to do its job without fear or favour, adding that Lagosians and the country as a whole deserve to know what led to the incident to forestall future occurrences.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nOther members of the panel are Akintilo Adeleke, Yinka Ogundairo, Godfrey C. Godfrey, Mrs Bunmi Ibraheem, while Mrs. Ekundayo Onajobi will serve as secretary.\n\nThe panel is expected to report back within four weeks.\n\nThe governor described the event as a \u201csad one\u201d for Lagos during the panel inauguration.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered here to perform a sad but necessary duty, which is the inauguration of a six-member panel of inquiry into the collapse of the 21-storey building at Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, on Monday. It is a solemn moment for me personally, but this is an important assignment. Indeed, the generation coming after will not forgive us if we don\u2019t do the right thing on this incident.\n\n\u201cThe inauguration of this panel shows sincerely that the state government is interested in unravelling and get to the root cause of what happened to the building, so that everyone concerned, including the government, will learn from the very unfortunate incident. Lagosians and the world will be watching and waiting keenly, with the full expectation that the immediate and remote causes of this tragedy will be uncovered.\u201d\n\nHe said the public deserved to know what went wrong and stressed that the work of the panel would not bring back the lives lost but would help to prevent future reoccurrence of such tragic events.\n\nHe said the oath taken by the tribunal members empowered them with adequate privileges of government powers to conduct independent investigation without fear, favour, interference and restrictions.\n\n\u201cWhat this tribunal will be doing over the course of the next few weeks will have important implications for building safety and for emergency response, not just in Lagos, but in the entire country. It will also go a long way towards ensuring that the families of the innocent victims of this avoidable tragedy experience some sort of closure and get justice,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nAyinde said Lagos was in its \u201cdark period\u201d given the record of fatalities from the site of the building collapse and pledged on behalf of members to discharge the duty with all sense of responsibility and in line with ethics.\n\nThe governor, who left the venue for the collapsed building site on Gerrard Road, met and interacted with all the first responders to enable him assess the extent of the rescue operation ongoing. He said the bodies would as from today be ready for release to their families for burial, as autopsy was being rounded off on them.\n\nThe governor said the process was taking long because corona inquisition, among others was being conducted, saying such could also reveal more information about few of the affected.\n\nMeanwhile, the body of the Managing Director, Fourscore Homes, Femis Osibona, has been recovered in the rubble of the collapsed Ikoyi building.\n\nFourscore Homes is the firm constructing the 21-storey building under construction which collapsed on Monday, on Gerrard Road in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nThe National Emergency Management Agency confirmed this last night. So far, authorities have announced 39 recovered bodies from the rubble.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

He condoles with the families and relatives of all those who have died, were injured or affected in the collapse. Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlso, the attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building published by Sahara Reporters on November 4th, 2021, to the effect that:\n\n1. The VP owns the land upon which the collapsed building in Ikoyi stood.\n\n2. That the said land was sold to him by Chief Michael Ade. Ojo, Chairman of Elizade Motors; and\n\n3. That the Vice President, at some point, intervened with the regulatory authorities in Lagos State to unseal the said property.\n\n\u201cLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land. He has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade. Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade. Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAll property and assets owned by the Vice President have been publicly declared.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed. He has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\n\n\u201cSahara Reporters were undoubtedly well rewarded for their criminal and inhumane conduct.

          "text": "Says INEC has guaranteed transparent election\n\n18 governorship hopefuls sign peace accord\n\nAll is set for tomorrow, declares electoral body\n\nIPOB suspends stay-at-home order\n\nPDP reiterates call for Kanu\u2019s release\n\nChidoka, Abaribe, Amadi, others call for peaceful exercise\n\nNBC warns against inciting broadcast\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nChairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC) and former Head of State, General Abdulsalamii Abubakar, has appealed to political parties and their candidates in Anambra State to accept the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s governorship election once pronounced credible. Abdulsalamii made the call in Awka at a Peace Accord signing ceremony preparatory to the poll, which was attended by candidates of the 18 contesting political parties.\n\nAbdulsalamii, who coordinated the signing of the peace understanding, assured that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had promised a credible election in the state.\n\nChairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said the commission had, against incredible odds, done all it should to make the electoral process smooth. Yakubu called for a violence-free poll.\n\nRemarkably, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had a change of heart and suspended its stay-at-home order, billed to commence today.\n\nBut the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) called for the release of the detained IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu. PDP said releasing Kanu and engaging the group in a dialogue would help to stem the tide of insecurity in Anambra State and the entire South-east.\n\nIn a similar vein, some key voices in the South-east called for a halt to violence and hostility in Anambra State. Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; and a law lecturer and activist, Dr. Sam Amadi, pleaded for peaceful conduct of the governorship election.\n\nBut the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) warned all broadcast stations covering the Anambra State governorship election to avoid languages and scenes likely to encourage, incite or compromise the unity or corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the Peace Accord signing ceremony held at the Professor Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre, Abdulsalamii urged the governorship hopefuls to abide by the letter and spirit of the peace pact, which they had agreed to. He told the candidates that the peace accord was a clarion call to them to commit to a peaceful election, adding that the pact became necessary following the history of electoral violence in the country.\n\nAbdulsalamii stated, \u201cIn Nigeria, almost every election was accompanied by violence, ballot box snatching, vote buying, outright disruption of the process, and in some cases, the intimidation of ordinary citizens, who simply want to select a leader, who will govern them.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of the National Peace Committee, have come to Anambra to support a peaceful electoral process. We cherish Anambra and we cherish the peace and unity of Nigeria. Most importantly, we want to contribute our own quota to see that the governorship election in Anambra is devoid of violence.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the signing of the peace accord today is not a mere exercise, it is, indeed, a clarion call for all the candidates and the political parties and all people of Anambra people to commit themselves to have peaceful process.\n\n\u201cWe call on all the candidates, political parties and their supporters to accept the outcome of the poll as long as it is adjudged to be free, fair and credible. I have been assured by the chairman of INEC that all efforts are in place to ensure a free and fair election.\n\n\u201cAll of us have the responsibility to deepen the cause of democracy in every part of Nigeria. We want every Nigerian to begin to enjoy the fruits of democracy. This can only happen, when there is peace and stability.\u201d\n\nThe peace deal signing ceremony saw the candidates of all the political parties participating in tomorrow\u2019s election, the INEC chairman, and NPC chairman, putting pen to paper and signing up to an agreement to ensure peace before, during, and after the November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe event, organised by Abdulsalamii and Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah to foster peace among politicians and their supporters, was attended by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, represented by Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Joseph Egbunike, who hails from Anambra State.\n\nOthers at the ceremony were Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Anambra State; the leadership of all the political parties; and Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) Chairmen.\n\nThose who signed the agreement included former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Charles Soludo; Mr. Valentine Ozigbo of PDP; Senator Ifeanyi Ubah of Young Progressives Party (YPP); and Andy Uba of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAll Set for Tomorrow, Says INEC\n\nThe INEC chairman said the commission had done all it should to make the electoral process smooth. Yakubu appealed for a violence-free poll.\n\nHe commended the National Peace Committee for always lending INEC a helping hand whenever it was faced with the challenge of insecurity.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cFaced with the current situation in Anambra State, the commission once again appealed to the NPC to bring parties and candidates to commit to peace before, during and after the election. We believe that Anambra cannot be different from Edo and Ondo. For this reason, we are also confident that, just like Edo and Ondo, the election on Saturday will be peaceful and the outcome will reflect the will of the Anambra voters.\n\n\u201cINEC has done everything possible to ensure credible elections in Anambra State under very difficult circumstances. I would like to appeal to all parties, candidates and other actors to play their roles in support of the Peace Accord.\n\n\u201cWithout peace, our deployment plans, innovations in voter accreditation and result management, safety of election duty personnel and accredited observers, security of election materials and, ultimately, the credibility of the polls will be undermined. That is why we must all support today\u2019s Peace Accord and the work of the NPC, in general.\n\n\u201cBefore I conclude, let me re-echo what the chairman of the NPC has just said. Those who signed the Peace Accord must abide by its letter and spirit in words and deeds.\u201d\n\nIPOB Suspends Stay-at-home Order\n\nA statement yesterday, signed by IPOB\u2019s Director of Publicity, Emma Powerful, said the group decided to call off its stay-at-home order following appeals by elders in the South-east, coupled with the grave economic implications of the movement restriction for the people.\n\nThe body urged the people of Anambra State to come out and vote in the governorship poll without intimidation or fear.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFollowing the genuine intervention of our elders, esteemed traditional institutions/rulers and religious leaders, and after due consideration of the positive impacts of their engagement, and sequel to the fact that our elders have spoken in our terms, the leadership of IPOB, ably led by Nnamdi Kanu, hereby and immediately calls off the one-week sit-at-home earlier declared to commence tomorrow, November 5, to November 10, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have equally considered several appeals by our mothers, who earn their living based on their daily economic activities, which will obviously be affected if the region is locked down for one whole week. It\u2019s never our intention to add to the pains of our people, hence, our decision to suspend the sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cThe people of Anambra State should go out en masse and peacefully exercise their franchise come 6th November 2021, and accordingly, choose a leader of their choice and should not be intimidated by anybody, group of persons or security agents.\n\n\u201cAnambrarians should vote and standby to protect their votes. No rigging of any kind will be tolerated on the Anambra State governorship election. It must be transparent, free and fair to all.\n\n\u201cWe wish to thank IPOB members worldwide, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom for their continued support for our dogged struggle for independence.\n\n\u201cMay we, therefore, warn detractors, traitors and our enemies not to cause confusion by imputing motives to our decision. IPOB doesn\u2019t expect anybody to observe, monitor or enforce the suspended order, otherwise, such action will be considered a rebellion to the highest leadership of our global movement.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, our oppressors should not take our decision as an act of cowardice. IPOB still believes that our elders, religious leaders, political leaders and various stakeholders will live up to their promises in their engagements and efforts towards securing the unconditional release of our leader.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge everyone to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any molestations. All agents of darkness recruited by our enemies to inflict pain on our people under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home are hereby warned to steer clear or brace up for the consequences of their evil action.\u201d\n\nState PDP Chapter Reiterates Call for Kanu\u2019s Release\n\nPDP, in a statement by the publicity secretary of the party\u2019s Publicity Committee for the Anambra election, Ken Okologbo, said, \u201cPresident Yar\u2019Adua used the stick and carrot approach to stem the issue of militancy in the South-south. This brought the present peace experienced in that region and greatly increased our revenue as a country.\n\n\u201cThe APC government will rather continue to leave us in this terrible state of insecurity all over the country. We are fast turning into Afghanistan, as rightly described by Governors Okowa and Ortom.\u201d\n\nThe statement said PDP ended its campaign at Uga, in Auguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. It alleged that the party was \u201cmindful of the propaganda going on that money was used in mobilising the huge crowd that thronged Alex Ekwueme Square on Tuesday 2nd November 2021, where we had our official flag-off.\n\n\u201cOur opponents are intimidated by the overwhelming welcome Ndi Anambra have shown for our candidate Valentine Ozigbo and our party.\u201d\n\nThe party called on INEC to go beyond the peace accord and ensure that incident forms were not used during the election.\n\nPDP stated, \u201cWe have all been assured that the Bimodal system of accreditation will be applied. If the card reader fails to recognise your thumbprint then the facial features will also come into play. This was used in Isoko South by-election to the Delta State House of Assembly and we saw how successful it turned out to be.\n\n\u201cWe are set to win this election and we urge Ndi Anambra to come out to vote for PDP. A vote for our party is a signal to what will be happening in Ekiti, Osun and eventually in 2023 to free us of the rudderless government of APC that has left us in this complete state of insecurity presently threatening the elections in the South-east.\u201d\n\nChidoka, Abaribe, Amadi, Others Call for Peaceful Exercise\n\nThe plea for peace was the central point of a conversation initiated and anchored by Chidoka on practical ways to push through the agitation of the South-east people, particularly, within the context of the Anambra election.\n\nThe discussants, including Abaribe and Amadi, said call became imperative to prevent external forces, criminal elements and desperate politicians from hijacking the genuine agitation of the people and cashing in on the situation in the state to unleash violence and frame up innocent persons to justify state-backed brutality.\n\nThe trio urged the various groups agitating in the region to shame and disarm their traducers by asking Anambra people to come out and choose the leader that approximates the type of personality they would represent Ndi Igbo in their yearnings as a people.\n\nThe discussants believed, \u201cThe act of Ndi Anambra voting on Saturday is a major part of the affirmation of our self-determination as a people. If the people cannot decide who will govern them through an election, they are not close to determining their future through a democratic process. Denying the people the right to vote is a major denial of their rights to self-determination.\n\n\u201cWhen the people elect a leadership that represents their hopes and aspirations, they are in a position to pursue the people\u2019s agenda more effectively. Whatever is the plan, it has to go through a political process. If you have governors and legislators, who share in the vision, it would be easier to realise such vision.\u201d\n\nAbaribe pointed out he would have languished in prison if he was not a senator and ready to meet the bail condition that required a senator to stand surety.\n\n\u201cYou have to be in the game to score a goal,\u201d Abaribe explained.\n\nAmadi called for a more pragmatic strategy in the South-east, like the Catalonia approach of self-development and using the movement as a platform to achieve political control.\n\nIn his summary of the discussion, Chidoka restated the call for a peaceful election on Saturday and noted that the election was a significant part of the self-determination process of the people. He said the poll was an opportunity for the people to elect the leader that would best advance their agitation instead of allowing situations that give their traducers an upper hand to perpetrate violence and foist undesirable leadership on them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment in Anambra State, Don Adinuba, raised the alarm over an alleged plot by some members of an unnamed political party to use the federal might to arrest key officials of Governor Willie Obiano\u2019s administration.\n\nIn a statement, Adinuba said the desperate politicians wanted to use certain compromised security operatives to orchestrate the sinister plan. He added that the statement was designed to bring the evil plan of the people to the knowledge of Anambra people and also for the attention of all relevant authorities for prompt action.\n\nIGP Restricts Movement\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) announced a 24-hour restriction of movement in Anambra, beginning from today, Friday, at 11:59pm. Deputy Inspector General in charge of operations, Mr Zaki Ahmed, who is the leader of the operations, announced this to journalists while unveiling the activities of police operatives posted for the Anambra governorship election.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cI assure you that the police will be professional in carrying out its duty throughout the election, and will maintain neutrality and a level playing ground for all the political parties.\n\n\u201cAdequate security is provided and you have seen the level of manpower in the state, and we are working in collaboration with other security agencies to ensure peace in the state. We are protecting everyone and ensuring that all parties will be protected equally.\n\n\u201cWe have created intervention spots and they will respond to any distress call. This is a national assignment and we should work hand-in-hand to ensure peaceful election.\n\n\u201cThe restriction of movement is for 24 hours and begins on Friday 11:59. All the hotels in Awka are very well covered and fully armed men are there. We have men on all the streets of Awka and we are well protected. We have cautioned our men over human rights abuses, and they are sure to behave themselves.\u201d\n\nSouth-east Marginalisation Responsible for Agitation\n\nIn a related development, the governorship candidates of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr Obinna Uzor, and Africa Democratic Congress (ADC), Mr Akachukwu Nwankwo, insisted that the marginalisation of the South-east in the distribution of national resources was the trigger for the agitation championed by IPOB.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, Nwankwo said the federal government should engage IPOB in order to resolve the insecurity in the region.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere should be a tactical, rational approach that enables us to have this conversation going. What IPOB is saying is that they want good governance. IPOB wants a relationship between the Igbo people and the federal government that makes every Igbo child feel that he is part of Nigeria. In the absence of that, they want to leave Nigeria. Theoretically, that\u2019s what they are doing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Uzor said the situation required a political solution. He said, \u201cWhat they are saying is, recognise us, let us be part of Nigeria. The Igbo are the most patriotic tribe in Nigeria. What we are saying is, let us have a dialogue, let\u2019s have a political solution.\u201d\n\nAA Candidate Optimistic of Free, Fair Poll Dutch\n\nThe governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Mr. Ben Etiaba, said yesterday that he was confident that INEC would conduct a free and fair election tomorrow. Etiaba said he expected that the turnout might be low but expressed the readiness of his party\u2019s followers to turn out en masse to cast their ballot.\n\nHe spoke on Arise News Channel, saying, \u201cI have more faith in this election than I have ever had. INEC went out of their way as a body to educate the political parties, the masses, and the candidates on what to expect.\n\n\u201cThey have come up with a system that if adopted and if implemented properly would give us a credible result. I have no reason to believe that the election wouldn\u2019t be credible. I am not one of those, who believe the results have been written. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe this election would be credible.\u201d\n\nOn voter turnout and the fear of voter suppression, Etiaba noted that there was a valid concern of voters about their safety. But he remained optimistic of an average turnout.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn every election, voter turnout has been suppressed, but I would be lying if I didn\u2019t acknowledge the fact that there would be more voter apathy this time than we have always had. The number of people voting would be suppressed than before, because people are scared.\n\n\u201cBut it is my belief that enough people would turn out to make the exercise very credible and whatever happens, there would be a result and I am looking forward to mobilising people to make sure people come out to vote for us and create an upset if we win.\u201d\n\nNBC Warns against Inciting Broadcast\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) urged all broadcast stations covering tomorrow\u2019s election in Anambra State to eschew broadcast language and scenes capable of stoking emotions and violence.\n\nDirector General of NBC, Balarabe Shehu Ilelah, issued the warning yesterday in a press statement.\n\nIlelah implored all broadcasters to desist from using or allowing their platforms and facilities to be used for the broadcast of contents that might lead to the breakdown of law and order. He asked all broadcasting stations to take note of the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcast Code and other relevant regulations guiding the broadcast of elections in the country.\n\nIlelah cited some of the provisions, including sections 3.11.1 (a), 3.11.1 (b), 5.41 (f), 5.3.3(j), 5.3.3 (i), 5.3.3 (k) and 5.3.4 that required broadcast stations to ensure that no programme contained anything tantamount to subversion of constituted authority.\n\nSpecifically, section 5.41 (f) provides, \u201cBroadcast shall not transmit divisive materials that may threaten or compromise the indivisibility and indissolubility of Nigeria as a sovereign state,\u201d he said.\n\nNBC also warned broadcasters to end the broadcast of partisan political campaign, jingle and any form of partisan political party identification 24 hours before the election. It said broadcast stations should use any vote obtained at the polling station or from an exit poll to project or speculate on the chances of a candidate.\n\nIlelah said the relay of election results or declaration of a winner could only be done by the authorised electoral officer for the election. He warned that any broadcaster that breached any of the listed provisions of the code shall be severely sanctioned.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NCC, Telcos Differ on N75bn Reserve Price for 3.5GHz Spectrum",
          "text": "*Fixes December 13 for auction\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nAhead of preparations for 5G rollout in Nigeria in 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has released draft Information Memorandum (IM) for 3.5GHz spectrum auction that would facilitate 5G rollout across the country.\n\nThe NCC had fixed December 13, 2021, for the 3.5GHz spectrum auction and had pegged the reserve price at $197.4 million (N75 billion).\n\nBut telecoms operators, including GSM Association (GSMA), have disagreed with the reserve price, and have called for a downward review to enable more operators participate in the 3.5GHz auction process.\n\nThe NCC at a stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum, held in Lagos yesterday, presented the dissenting positions of the operators and the GSMA, which they had earlier submitted to the commission.\n\nThe stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum, which was organised by the NCC further discussed the reserve price, among other issues such as longevity of the spectrum licence, the auction process, the requirements and rollout obligations.\n\nWhile the NCC was considering 10 years period for the duration of the spectrum, the operators want the NCC to extend it to 20 years, to enable winners of the spectrum to have enough rollout time to utilise the spectrum in offering telecoms services to subscribers.\n\nReacting to the N75 billion reserve price, telecoms operators, which included MTN, Airtel, Huawei, Intelsat, including the GSMA, called on NCC, to consider the current exchange rate in pegging the reserve price.\n\nThey argued that if the reserve price remained high, it would discourage operators from participating in the auction process.\n\nThe Director, Spectrum Administration at NCC, Oluwatoyin Asaju, who presented the draft IM for the 3.5GHz spectrum auction at the stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum said: \u201cThe IM provides guidance and process that the commission has decided to adopt for the licensing of the 3.5 GHz band, including details of the spectrum to be made available, the pre-qualification process and the auction process.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the 3.5GHz spectrum would come in five lots of 100 MHz each, to be cleared at different periods depending on the level of encumbrances on the slots.\n\nHe, however, said for the purpose of the auction, only two lots of 100 MHz each would be offered in the first phase of the auction, while the remaining three lots would be auctioned some other time.\n\nFor the auction process, Asaju explained that it would be Ascending Clock Auction (ACA), while the auction would be software based.\n\nHe said provisions had been made for manual auction should the auction software fail during the auction process, adding that there would be a mock auction that would precede the main auction on December 13.\n\n\u201cA reserve price of approximately N75 billion, equivalent to $197,400,000.00, will to be used. An Initial Bid Deposit (IBD) equal to 10 per cent of the reserve price is adopted in line with the previous auction.\n\n\u201cNew entrants are allowed to participate in the auction in addition to existing licensees and only licensees with 100 per cent regulatory compliance will be allowed to participate in the auction.\n\n\u201cThe auction comes with a 10-year spectrum licence and a minimum requirement of a UASL Operational Licence. New entrants or licensees without a UASL will be required to additionally obtain a UASL Operational Licence,\u201d Asaju said.\n\nFor the rollout obligations, he said operators would in the first two years, starting from the effective date of the licence, roll out service in at least one state in each geo-political zone, including federal capital territory, and in additional six states after the five years.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, in his keynote address, said the planned 3.5GHz spectrum auction was another milestone in the desire of the federal government to roll out 5G network in the country as quickly as possible.\n\nPantami who was represented by a director in the ministry, Mr. Abubakar Abdullahi Ladan, said: \u201cThe 3.5GHz spectrum band (the lower C-band), which is not effective in satellite operations, has been recovered from NIGCOMSAT and reallocated to the NCC in the first instance, for deployment of 5G technology based on terms and conditions agreed by both parties.\n\n\u201cThe next step is auctioning of the spectrum which is under the purview of the regulator of the industry. However, for transparency and accountability in the sale of this common national heritage, the federal government thought it wise to involve relevant stakeholders in the process so that the general public is carried along.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this gathering therefore, is to discuss the Information Memorandum on the Auction of this 3.5GHz Spectrum Band allocated for deployment of 5G network in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, in his speech, said: \u201c5G technology does not only offer enhanced broadband and ultra-reliable low/latency communications, it also provides massive machine type communications, where lots of devices will seamlessly connect and interact independently with the Internet without human intervention.\n\n\u201cGiven the importance of 5G technology and the critical role of spectrum, the International Telecommunications Union Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R) conducted studies in its last two study cycles during the World Radio Communication Conferences of 2015 and 2019 (WRC-15 & WRC-19) and identified spectrum for 5G technology including the 3.5GHz band, which stands out due to its excellent propagation characteristics which offer both capacity and coverage.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash valued at $2 billion after investment from world\u2019s most valuable crypto exchange",
          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

          "text": "This weekend millions of voters in Anambra will head out to elect the next governor of the state.\n\nAnambra has in recent times been subject to security worries due to the activities of secessionist groups like the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over the continued detention of their leader Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nKanu is undergoing trial over allegations of treason. The election in Anambra this weekend, therefore, is seen by many as critical to addressing the developmental issues bedeviling the state. Hence, the eventual winner has to be someone the people carefully choose.\n\nThere are three major candidates including Valentine Ozigbo, Andy Uba, and Charles Soludo.\n\nValentine Ozigbo\n\nBorn in Anambra in the southeastern part of Nigeria, Vincent Chineto Ozigbo described himself in several interviews as a high flyer in his school days at Christ the Redeemer College, Amesi in Anambra State where he had his secondary school education.\n\nHe graduated with a first-class degree in Accounting at the University of Nigeria Nsukka in 1994 where he also obtained his master\u2019s degree in 2000. He also won a Chevening scholarship to study finance at Lancaster University in the UK.\n\nThe PDP governorship candidate has worked in various organizations including Diamond Bank, UBA, FSB international banking, Keystone bank, and most notably the managing director and Chief Executive Officer of Transcorp Hotels where he actualized business expansion objectives with numerous awards.\n\nRead also: The state as internet police\n\nThe former Transcorp Hotels Chief Executive Officer is married to Mary-Callista Ojiugo Ozigbo and blessed with four children; Mario, Angello, Mitchel, and Valerie.\n\nWith the popular slogan \u201cKa Anambra chawapu\u201d which in English translates to \u201clet Anambra shine\u201d\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nCharles Chukwuma Soludo hails from Aguata in Anambra state. He was born on the 28th of July 1960. Although little is known about his childhood, he lost his mother at the age of 8 years.\n\nAfter his primary and secondary school education, Soludo obtained his first degree, Master\u2019s degree, and a professorship at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka Enugu state where he bagged first-class honours in his first degree in 1984 and he was designated the best student at all three levels.\n\nHe was appointed a professor in Economics in the same university in 1998 and the next year was a visiting professor at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, US.\n\nUnder the Obasanjo regime, Soludo became the chief economic adviser for the former president in 2003 and the Chief Executive Officer of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria. He became the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2008 and an appointed member of the newly formed 8-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) On October 16, 2019.\n\nCharles Soludo is happily married to Nonye Chukwuma Soludo and they are blessed with 6 children.\n\nAfter coming short in his 2010 Anambra governorship bid, he now aspires to become the next governor in 2022 under the party of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party.\n\nHe has written books like \u2018North-South Macroeconomic Interactions: Comparative Analysis using the Multimod and Intermod global models\u2019 in 1992, and so many other books on macroeconomics, some of them he co-wrote with other scholars.\n\nAndy Uba\n\nBorn Emmanuel Nnamdi Uba on the 14th December 1958 in Enugu southeast of Nigeria, he started his education at Boys High School in Awkunanaw.\n\nAfter secondary school, Uba claimed he went on to study at Concordia University, however, the University has conceded that although he was admitted, he never finished the program he applied for.\n\nFollowing a role he played in helping the PDP secure the Presidency in 1999 even though he was residing in the United States, he got back to Nigeria and was appointed Special Assistant on Special Duties and Domestic Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nUba participated in the PDP primaries for the Anambra State governorship election,14 April 2007 and was elected as governor of the state. However, the election was challenged by Peter Obi who argued that he had won the election in 2006 and since the courts had acknowledged that victory, he still had three more years to serve in the position of governor of Anambra. The courts accepted Obi\u2019s arguments.\n\nIn April 2011 Uba won the Anambra South Senatorial region on the platform of PDP.\n\nHe defected to the ruling party APC in February 2017 and is now running for the office of governor of Anambra state for the November 2021 polls.\n\nUba is married to Gloria Obiageli although separated; they have 4 children.",

          "title": "MTN, Airtel mobile money licences to benefit 40m unbanked Nigerians",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unbanked adult population, estimated at over 40 million, are expected to have access to financial services with the regulatory approval of mobile money licences for MTN and Airtel, the country\u2019s two biggest telecommunication service providers.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Thursday issued MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa Approval-in-Principle (AIP) for payment service bank (PSB) licence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the first step in the process towards final approval, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as stipulated by the CBN, the move by the industry regulator brings the take-off of mobile money services in Nigeria closer.\n\n\u201cWith this move by CBN, it is more likely that we are going to meet some of the financial inclusion targets,\u201d Ashley Immanuel, CEO of EFInA, the organization that collates Nigeria\u2019s biennial financial inclusion data, said.\n\nThis, according to her, is based on the evidence that has been witnessed in countries that have leveraged the mobile money-led financial inclusion model to onboard the majority of their unbanked population.\n\nLargely driven by mobile technology, Kenya\u2019s financial inclusion expanded from a low base of 26.7 percent a decade ago to 83 percent in 2020. The East African country is one of the world\u2019s leaders in mobile money services. Telecom\u2019s operator Safaricom pioneered its M-Pesa service 12 years ago to cater for Kenyans without access to the formal banking network.\n\nThe success story of mobile money in deepening financial inclusion is also evident in countries like Ghana, Ethiopia and others.\n\nWhile Nigeria went late to the party as the Central Bank only gave an official nod to telecoms and other non-financial companies to offer financial services in 2018, the payment service bank by the regulator would enable players to offer financial services while deepening the country\u2019s financial inclusion rate.\n\nRead also: CBN issues \u2018Approval-in-Principle\u2019 to MTN, Airtel for PSB services\n\nThe permit will allow the companies to among other things; maintain savings accounts and accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, which is covered by the deposit insurance scheme; carry out payments and remittance (including cross-border personal remittance) services through various channels within Nigeria; issue debit and prepaid cards, and operate an electronic purse or wallet.\n\nThe Central Bank gave its first set of licences to three players in August 2020, two years after it received applications.\n\nBefore now, only banks and licensed financial institutions were allowed to provide financial services (bank-led financial inclusion model). Although telecom operators and other fintech companies indicated interest to operate in the market, the CBN policy would not allow them.\n\nThe regulator eventually shifted because of the increasing rate of financially excluded people in Nigeria and the lack of progress in getting banks to provide financial services to people living in areas that lack access.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the apex bank set a target to ensure that 80 percent of the country\u2019s adult population are financially included in the financial cycle by 2020. The CBN had in a circular in July 2018, lamented that Nigeria was not meeting any of the financial inclusion targets agreed and contained in the 2012 Financial Inclusion Strategy.\n\nNigeria failed to meet its National Financial Inclusion Strategy target for 2020 to include 80 percent of its adult population into the financial system. EFInA data showed that only 64.1 percent was financially included by the end of last year.\n\nThis means that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38.1 million of the country\u2019s 106 million (18 years and above) adults, remain completely financially excluded. This is a shortfall by 16 percent points from the desired target of a 20 percent exclusion rate.\n\nThe 2012 strategy by the CBN had also aimed to reach 70 percent of Nigerians with formal financial services by 2020; the actual figure reported by the EFInA\u2019s Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey released last Thursday showed it was 51 percent \u2013 a shortfall by 19 percent points.\n\nFinancial inclusion means that people have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit and insurance. A higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population, as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\nA higher financial exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWe have said that the biggest thing the CBN could do to quickly expand financial access to people who are not in the system at all is to increase mobile money services which in Nigeria will be under the PSB license and to licence entities that are capable at reaching customers at scale,\u201d Immanuel said.\n\nCommenting on the recently issued Approval in Principle, MTN Nigeria said, the decision to issue a final approval is firmly within the regulatory purview of the CBN and it respects their right and judgement in that regard.\n\nWith its presence in 14 countries across Africa, Airtel Africa, a provider of telecommunications and mobile money services said that its subsidiary SMARTCASH Payment Service Bank Limited (\u201cSmartcash\u201d) has been granted approval in principle to operate a payment service bank business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsanya, CEO, Airtel Africa, the telecom company \u201cwill now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the operating licence and commence operations.\u201d\n\nWhy mobile money is a catalyst for financial inclusion growth\n\nThe use of the mobile money-led financial inclusion model has been adopted by many countries that previously suffered high financial exclusion rates because it is one of the easiest ways to include the hard-to-reach unbanked population into the formal financial system.\n\nIn the case of Kenya, Ghana and many other African countries, with the use of mobile phone numbers which are used in place of a bank account, citizens of the countries are allowed to carry out financial transactions like payment, savings, credit, insurance and among others.\n\nThe same is expected to happen in Nigeria through the PSB licence. The innovation will remove some of the barriers to having a basic bank account like documentation in obtaining a Bank Verification Number (BVN), an 11-digit number that is created for bank customers before they are assigned a bank account, proximity to financial services provider and among others.\n\nWith just a phone number, any Nigerian who does not have a bank account will most likely be able to ride on the infrastructure of any of the telco or other service providers to transact through an e-wallet or mobile money account.",

          "text": "In 2008, a 22-storey building came down in rubbles in Lagos State, but no life was lost, no injury or damage to surrounding buildings was recorded. That was the Bank of Industry (BoI) building constructed in 1972 and brought down through controlled demolition.\n\nThirteen years later, November 2021, a 21-storey building under construction collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos, killing more than 36 people (so far) with dozens injured and many others missing.\n\nThe two buildings are, so far, the largest structures to have crumbled in Lagos, but also two distinctly contrasting stories behind them. One was safely brought down when authorities thought it had become a risk while the other represented a failure of authorities to ensure the developer kept to standards and approvals.\n\nEvidence from the Lagos State government shows that the developer of the building located at 20 Gerard Road, Ikoyi, flouted building permits. In a letter issued to Fourscore Height Limited on April 5, 2019, with registration number IV/2019/DO/033/67 and permit number DCB/DO/2442IV on April 9, 2019, the structure was originally approved for 15 floors, not 21.\n\nA year before this, Prowess Engineering Limited, the original contractor for the building, in a letter dated February 20, 2020, notified Fourscore Homes Limited that it was withdrawing its services on the now collapsed building.\n\nRead Also: Collapsed building: Experts\u2019 views\n\nProwess stated in the letter, \u201cWe arrived at this decision due to the fact that we no longer share the same vision with you as our client in terms of how the project is being executed.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the Fourscore Homes building, on September 21, 2008, the administration of Babatunde Fashola, the then governor of Lagos State, supervised the demolition of the 22-storey BoI building.\n\nCollapsed buildings in Lagos\n\nThe skyscraper located on 67/71 Broad Street in Ikoyi before being brought to its feet had endured five fire incidents that eroded its quality and contributed to a partial collapse reported on March 22, 2006.\n\nThe controlled demolition project that gulped N1.5 billion from the state coffers would be remembered for two feats \u2013 the first of its kind in West Africa and the only building that collapsed without any casualty, not even the least damage to surrounding structures.\n\nBroad Street\u2019s tallest building crumbled within 10 seconds without bulldozers or cranes but with around 5,900 explosives planted strategically around the beams of the structure and then detonated through remote devices.\n\nConsequently, the building collapsed on its weight with rumbles and very thick dust that, for more than 10 minutes, covered the surrounding.\n\nBabatunde Fashola, immediately after the exercise, affirmed his government implemented guided demolition as the path of least risk to the residents in the area. He added that though the building had partially collapsed on March 22, 2006, the state government patiently persuaded both the Federal Government and the BoI management to proffer any solution but this proved abortive.\n\nRead also: Body of Osibona, owner of collapsed high-rise building recovered\n\nAs a result, the state had no other option than to resolve to exercise the constitutional powers of the governor under Section 28 of the Land Use Act by acquiring the property along Broad Street, within which the BoI building was located.\n\nHowever, unlike the BoI building demolished with no casualties, the Fourscore Homes 21-storey building that collapsed on November 1, around 3pm has more than 36 persons so far confirmed dead, even as the cause of the collapse is yet to be ascertained.\n\nApproved initially for a 15-storey building, the Fourscore Homes structure was designed as a luxury apartment to be known as 360 Degrees Towers. The collapsed building promised residents the scenic views of the Lagos lagoon, the Atlantic Ocean, neighbouring estates such as Banana Island, Osborne Road, and the Third Mainland Bridge, as well as the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\n\nFor the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute (NBRRI), the high incidence of building collapse in the country could be attributed to poor supervision and the use of inferior materials in the construction of buildings.\n\nIt buttresses the position of David Majekodunmi, the state chairman of the Nigerian Institute of Architects, who earlier decried lack of strict building regulations by the government and regulatory bodies, as reasons for the collapse of the Ikoyi building.\n\nMajekodunmi, speaking with the media recently, faulted the Project Board at the construction site of the building, noting that the numbers on the board showed that the same person was the consultant and the architect.\n\n\u201cIf the regulatory bodies had seen this board and done the needful, maybe we would be able to know who we are accusing or who to hold responsible for this mayhem,\u201d Majekodunni said.\n\nOkunola Olasunkanmi, a building plan research expert, stated that Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub had witnessed about 155 buildings collapse in a space of 16 years.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin, Prof. Lilian Salami has described Edo Creative Hub and Edo Tech as positive steps by the Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s administration to engage youths in the state and assured of a synergy between the University and the Ministry of Communications and orientation with the installmental defraying of debts owed the Bendel Newspapers Company Limited, publishers of the Nigerian Observer titles.\n\nSpeaking during a working visit of the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation. Hon Adaze Emwanta to the University of Benin yesterday, the Vice Chancellor congratulated the state governor for believing in the youths\n\n\u201cI appreciate the fact that the administration recognizes the power of the youth especially in a University of our own level. A University that is in the forefront of the Nigerian University system with a population of over sixty thousand students\n\n\u201cEngaging them positively will do a whole lot of good to the state. When I listened to the Orientation part of your portfolio I actually am excited because I know we need a lot of Orientation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do it all in the University and that can also be enhanced with an outfit like yours, with a Commissioner who is very vibrant and who will from time to time engage these students so that they can upheld that energy for constructive activity rather than destructive.\n\n\u201cWith the Edo Creative Hub and Tech Hub, these students have all the energy and I am sure they will be more than glad to be involved in all of these and I will also want to witness the town hall meeting so that we can forge ahead with the synergy with the University,\u201d The Vice Chancellor noted.\n\nOn the debt the University is owing the Bendel Newspaper Company Limited, publishers of the Nigerian Observer, she said the University has started paying, noting that all may not be liquidated at once but efforts are being made to pay the debt because in her words, \u201c I inherit both the liability and the Assets.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Adaze Emwanta said on assumption of office he decided to build synergy with all Edo people, adding that it is not a coincidence that the Vice Chancellor is from Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Governor\u2019s agenda is Making Edo Great Again. We were once a region, Midwest region and it was a very great region. This University started as Midwest institute of Technology and it was one of the institution people of the Midwest embraced.\n\nOver the years, from Midwest to Bendel and the state was known as number one for sports and Midwest Institute which became UNIBEN was one of the main hub for creative arts and Just recently, the late Prof Victor Uwaifo, may his soul rest in Peace was one of the great creative artist which this institution has produced.\n\n\u201cTo that extent I felt there was need for us if we say we want to Make Edo Great Again to collaborate across board because the idea is that every staff and student of UNIBEN in Edo state. Therefore the task of building this state is a collective one.\n\n\u201cWe are all here to serve Nigeria, both those who are in the state and those who are but reside in the state. I am here to see how we can build a new relationship; a new partnership because I will not take for granted the importance of communication and as Commissioner for communication I want us to bridge that information gap.\n\n\u201cOur people should be given proper orientation on issues of sanitation, irregular migration for students who are planning to travel abroad because there are lots of opportunities back home that we can leverage upon.\n\n\u201cWe have our Edo Creative Hub which most of the students will be interested in and it will be launched next Saturday in Benin City within the premises of the Nigerian Observe. There is the Tech Hub with about one hundred young people.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole lot that the University of Benin Can benefit from by having skills and by the time they graduate they will not be looking for white collar jobs but they themselves will become employers of labour.\n\nWhile disclosing a plan by the Ministry of Communication and Orientation to have a town hall meeting, the Commissioner said this will be an opportunity for the students to know what the government is doing.\n\nHe also informed the Vice chancellor of the debt owed the Nigerian Observer by previous administrations of the University which constituent the Internal Generated Revenue of the state government.\n\n\u201cFor us to Make Edo Great Again require money as most of the infrastructural works going on need money. Kindly use your good offices to ensure that the debt of about N12. 6 million is paid to make Edo Great Again.\n\n\u201cWhen I came in as Commissioner and I did a facility tour of the Nigerian Observer, I discovered that the printing machine being used was acquired by Former governor Samuel Ogbemudia in 1968. But today, luckily, Governor Obaseki has bought a brand new press and we are going to be having a new Nigerian Observer.\n\n\u201cThe new Nigerian Observer can print out tabloids, newspapers and for academics who are interested in printing books, you now have a new place in Nigeria because the press in the Nigerian Observer is the best and no newspaper house has that kind of press.\n\n\u201cWhat the former Nigerian Observer could do in one month is what this present press can do in one hour. That is where we are getting to with technology and the Edo State government will be very grateful if the debts are defrayed even though you did not incur them\u201d he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Bank of Industry has said the country\u2019s entrepreneurs don\u2019t have the habit of repaying loans, saying its non-performing loan portfolio awarded to entrepreneurs ranges between 80 and 100 per cent.\n\nThe bank\u2019s managing director, Olukayode Pitan, disclosed this recently at the first edition of the community engagement development workshop organised by the Arthur Mbanefo Digital Research Centre (AMDRC) of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka.\n\nThe workshop, with the theme; \u201cBuilding the Nigeria\u2019s Economy for the Immediate Future: The Role of Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Startups Creation,\u201d featured scholars and industry leaders including the director of the university\u2019s Institute of China Development Studies, Olufemi Saibu; head of programme- migration for development at the German Agency for International Cooperation, Sarah Alonge, and the director, entrepreneurship and skills development centre at UNILAG, Sunday Adebisi, among others.\n\nBOI\u2019s lamentation\n\nMr Pitan, in his presentation, listed some of the conditions it is difficult for Nigerian start-ups to access loans from the bank. He said if proper steps are taken start-ups can get loans of up to N10m to expand their business initiatives.\n\n\u201cYou can get the loans without bringing your house as security. All we require are two guarantors and I can tell you, most Nigerians have problems getting two guarantors because they know them. We require the BVNs of those guarantors and a few things but they will not give it because they know the people. So we are saying if people that know you do not want to guarantee you, why should we believe in you?\u201d he said.\n\nHe said another thing the bank tried was the introduction of matching grants which he noted that about 20 states are a part of.\n\nMr Pitan said; \u201cWe go to your state and tell the governor that any amount you give us, we will match it. We will lend the money in your state but I can tell you that the non-performing loan ratio so far is on the average between 80-100 per cent.\n\n\u201cPeople believe that any money from the Bank of Industry that is owned by the government is part of the national cake. All we ask of you is pay back that money so that we can give you another loan.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nigeria\u2019s brand of entrepreneurship will lead to increased poverty\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, in his own presentation, Mr Saibu said the way Nigeria is pursuing its entrepreneurship programme will only lead to an increased number of people living in poverty in the country.\n\nHe said an entrepreneur is expected to identify a problem, look critically at the problem, and come up with a solution that is treatable and can be exchanged with a buyer but that what Nigerian entrepreneurs are doing was merely to create applications for Nigerians to access products overseas.\n\n\u201cIf you create a product that nobody can buy, that is not a solution,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, an entrepreneur does three things including bringing up a completely new product or facilitating product getting to the buyer or creating access to that product.\n\n\u201cOur focus so far has been creating platforms for people to have access to products and that has been creating problems for our supply side. We are not creating entrepreneurs who are creating products, we only create entrepreneurs who facilitate the trading of a product produced in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said creating platforms and apps that make people buy oversea only adds problems to Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cThe start-ups may earn billions of dollars but they are adding to the problem of our country because the products and apps they created are promoting businesses overseas.\n\n\u201cThey make it easier for people to buy in Amazon and China but they have not made people buy from Nigeria. Therefore, we need to have a rethink that the entrepreneurs that we want to produce will be people who create products that we can sell outside Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Saibu also said the recently introduced Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Tertiary Institution Entrepreneur Scheme (TIES) identifies agricultural businesses, creative industry and science and technology, saying they are all about software application development.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe scheme is supposed to assist entrepreneurs and innovators but it will only create demand access, making Nigerians build websites and apps that can make it easy for people to buy overseas.\n\n\u201cThey are not looking for people who can go into engineering, develop a prototype of a phone that can be accessible to all Nigerians and produce locally for people to buy Nigeria-made phones.\n\n\u201cThey are not looking at entrepreneurs who can design vehicles that are not using electricity and solar but our oil and be able to make it available. So, until we begin to redirect our creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship towards expanding the domestic economy, we may continue to have increasing entrepreneurship and at the same time increasing unemployment.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said Nigeria needs to understand that it cannot teach entrepreneurs but develop the talent in people that they become entrepreneurs. \u201cIt is not the training that produced Ronaldo but the talent of a footballer that is in him. He was only given the opportunity to develop that potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to promote IT and my own take is that we should change information technology to industrial technology. It is when we build our industry that we can compete globally, not agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Africa cannot stay in the past\u2019\n\nOn his part, Mr Adebisi said that Africa has missed some developmental processes, saying; \u201cWe had the first, second and third revolutions, but we did not do anything about it, we are still living in the first industrial revolution and the world will not wait for us so we have missed it and this is the fourth industrial revolution, so because the world is not going to wait for us, we have to be integrated into the world so that at the end of the day Africa will not lose it all.\u201d\n\nHe said start ups have to be encouraged to go into what drives the fourth revolution. \u201cWe must be connected to the world and Fintech is what we must key into. We need to combine the fourth revolution with what professor Saibu said because if we lock down our economy we will lose it all.\u201d\n\nEnergy crisis\n\nMr Adebisi said local production is the best thing to boost local economy but he decried Nigeria\u2019s poor electricity, saying; \u201cIf I produce here, nobody will buy at my cost of production per unit, therefore, if as a Nigerian country I take my idea to china to create it into product, I know that I have exported jobs but by the time I bring the products back to Nigeria, I will contribute to the GDP.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to start from there whether we like it or not because if we wait for the government to give us energy, we will not do anything,\u201d he said.\n\nOpportunities for start-ups\n\nOn her part, Ms Alonge said there is a mismatch of opportunities and skills in Nigeria, noting that her organisation provides additional skills for people to increase their livelihood.\n\nShe said the existing skill mismatch within the Nigerian labour market contributes significantly to the unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cThis has to do with lack of information on the labour market\u2019s needs but also the discourse together with the need for direction of where the labour market is supposed to go which is what we are talking about when we talk about industrialisation, industrial development and others.\u201d\n\nIn her welcome remark, the director of the centre, Taiwo Ipaye, said the programme was introduced to bring both the town and gown together to address the needs of the labour market and provide the required skills for the tertiary institutions\u2019 products.\n\nMrs Ipaye, a former registrar of the university, said the centre is committed to creating a middle ground between the town and the gown for the socio-economic prosperity of the country.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, has denied ownership of a 21-storey building in Ikoyi, Lagos State, which collapsed on Monday killing at least 40 people so far, describing his alleged link to the property as sheer wickedness.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s reaction comes amid suggestions that he has a stake in the collapsed building, and may have influenced the Lagos State government to allow work to continue on the building even when it did not pass stress test.\n\nThe vice president who denied the allegations in a statement issued by his spokesman, Mr. Laolu Akande in Abuja on Friday, said emphasized that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the collapsed building or development.\n\nOsinbajo condoled with the families and relatives of all those who have died, those injured or affected in the collapse.\n\nThe Vice President frowned at the publication by a well-known online media outfit that had linked him to the collapsed building.\n\nThe online media outfit had in its publication claimed that the Vice President owns the land upon which the collapsed building in Ikoyi stood, while also alleging that he bought the said land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, Chairman of Elizade Motors.\n\n\u201cLet it be made clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land,\u201d Osinbajo said in the statement.\n\n\u201cHe has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\n\u201cAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade-Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\n\u201cAll property and assets owned by the Vice President have been publicly declared.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed.\n\n\u201cHe has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\n\u201cThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilize a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\u201d\n\nHe further said that the online medium was \u201cundoubtedly well rewarded for the criminal and inhumane conduct. Typical of a hatchet job and deliberately irresponsible journalism, the publication was not signed by anyone.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President has referred this disgraceful publication to his lawyers for prompt legal action.\u201d\n\nAde-Ojo, denies selling collapsed building land to Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of Elizade Motors and Elizade University, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, has denied selling the said land to Osinbajo.\n\nAde-Ojo in a statement issued and personally signed by him on Thursday, stated that he owns the property next to the collapsed building, adding that he has not sold it and does not intend to sell it to anyone.\n\n\u201cIt has come to my attention that a publication by the online news website, Sahara Reporters is in circulation, claiming that I owned the land on which the high-rise building in Ikoyi that collapsed earlier this week was built,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe story titled \u2018Photo Proof: Osinbajo bought the Ikoyi collapsed building\u2019 published on November 4, 2021, also claimed that I sold the land to the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo shortly after he became vice president.\n\n\u201cBoth claims are outright falsehoods. I hereby state that I do not own and never held title to the said property.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I did not sell any property to the vice president at any time whatsoever.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I own a property next to the said building, which I have not sold and do not intend to sell to anyone",

We have a Senators who were Chairmen of Senate Committee in Upstream and Downstream sector of the oil industry who are experts much more than Wike, why can\u2019t they lead? Why Wike?\n\n\u201cSecondly,Governor Wike had earlier told the world that he had bought OML 11, so why adopt an interested party to lead you in that kind of discussion with the federal government. He\u2019s not even qualified to be at meeting,\u201d Akpobari said.\n\nHowever, in a swift reaction, Solomon Lenu, an Ogoni human rights activist dismissed claims of Akpobari.\n\nHe pointed out that he has always advocated that those think the they have divine and exclusive mandate to discuss about the resumption to shift ground.\n\n\u201cAnybody can champion this movement for as long as it will lead to the desired end\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve found a stranger who genuinely wants to bail us out, then we have to be humble enough to accept such help without pride. Even though they all had their different agenda \u201d\n\nLenu further stated:\u201dTruth is that, if you are an Ogoni man who have means of livelihood and who moves around Ogonis at the lower echelon of life, then you\u2019ll see how badly things are with us and the need to end this protracted oil loggerhead, and the disservice of Ogoni elites to the people through their lack of patriotism and disunity\u201d.\n\nLedum Mitee, an Ogoni Leader and former President of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People,MOSOP, had told journalists yesterday said the choice of the governor was aimed at preventing saboteurs who may want to adopt divide and rule tactic to cause crisis in Ogoni at the detriment of the people.\n\nAccording to him, the Ogoni delegation to Abuja discussed a number of issues and it was important to brief Governor Wike on those issues.\n\n\u201cWe reviewed the outcome of that meeting and we, as a people resolved that, the issues that were discussed are such that required partnership with the state government.\n\n\u201cIn other words, we felt that the Government of Rivers State and Ogoni people would work together to pursue some of those issues that were raised as outcome of that meeting, specifically on the issues of OML 11 and resumption of oil.\n\n\u201cWe felt that it required some sustained and painstaking consultation process which must involve the State government as partnering with us and its leadership on how we will go together to work. So that, some divide and rule will not be exploited to the detriment of our people.\u201d\n\nIn his briefing, Senator Lee Maeba said the Ogonis are resolved to file behind the leadership that will be provided by Governor Wike concerning the setting up of a multi-consultative forum.\n\nMaeba stated that since President Buhari had issued directives, particularly as it has to do with the OML 11 whose licence has been granted to NPDC, there is need for the NNPC to consult and dialogue with Ogonis.",

          "text": "The bodies of Mr Femi Osibona, the Managing Director of Fourscore Heights Limited, and his buddy, Wale Bob-Oseni, a Nigerian businessman based in the United States of America, have been retrieved from the 21-story building that fell on Gerrard Road in the Ikoyi region of Lagos State.\n\nPUNCH Responders discovered their remains during the recovery effort at the scene of the incident on Thursday, according to Metro.\n\nOn Monday, real-estate trader Bob-Oseni was on his way back to the United States when he received a call from Osibona to inspect the project.\n\nWhen the structure collapsed, both of their buddies were trapped.\n\nAccording to our sources, the 21-story structure collapsed on Monday about 2 p.m., while Osibona, the project\u2019s owner, his clients, and staff were there.\n\nOn Thursday, one of our reporters who was on the scene said that no fewer than 40 bodies had been removed from the area.\n\nHowever, after 1 p.m., Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said that 32 bodies had been found.\n\nThe identification of bodies collected by emergency officials has been delayed, according to some relatives of the dead.\n\nSanwo-Olu had previously stated that autopsies were being performed on the bodies, but that families would be able to identify their loved ones starting Thursday.\n\nThe bereaved families claimed they were denied access to the bodies when they went to the Mainland Hospital mortuary in Yaba on Thursday.\n\nDespite the governor\u2019s assurances, Edward Godwin, the father of an 18-year-old boy, said he was not allowed to identify his son\u2019s body.\n\nHe said, \u201cI honestly needed to see my son yesterday (Wednesday). I\u2019ve been to the general hospital to check those injured, but my son was not there. I thought I would be able to see him today, but I\u2019ve not been able to see my son.\u201d\n\nA woman, who did not identify herself, said she had been to the state morgue as well but was not allowed to identify her sister\u2019s son.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe governor said yesterday (Wednesday) that we would be able to see the corpses recovered today (Thursday) and check if our loved ones were there. But when I went there today, I was not allowed to see anything despite telling them that the governor said we would be able to check today.\n\n\u201cI want to know if the boy is still alive or dead. I have not told my sister about what happened because she\u2019s not staying in Lagos and I want to know if he\u2019s dead or not before telling her. The government should just allow us to see if our people are there or not.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, who identified herself as Florence, said she spoke with her brother on Sunday before she got a call that he was among those trapped.\n\nShe said, \u201cMy younger brother is here; I spoke with him last on Sunday but someone called me that something happened and I came here yesterday.\n\n\u201cSomeone told me he was among those rushed to the hospital and I went to the general hospital and showed someone his picture and he confirmed that he was brought in unconscious. But since yesterday, I\u2019ve not seen him or sure of the hospital he was taken to.\u201d\n\nPUNCH Metro observed as a black Toyota Highlander reportedly owned by an aluminium fabricator trapped in the rubble was driven away from the site on Thursday.\n\nThe wife of the victim, who sat under a tree, looked vague and declined comment when one of our correspondents approached her.\n\nConflicting casualty figures\n\nA senior government officer, who did not want to be identified, told PUNCH Metro that 35 males and three females were brought out dead from the rubble as of 11.50am on Thursday.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who was at the scene, noted that more bodies were brought out after that time.\n\nHowever, the state governor, Sanwo-Olu, while addressing journalists on Thursday around 1pm, said the state Ministry of Health was in charge of taking corpses to the morgue.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we stand here and we speak, we have recovered a total of 32 dead bodies and they have been transported to the morgue and the reason why the corpses were moved to the IDH is because it\u2019s one of the foremost preserved morgues we have in Lagos.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s understand what the chain of command is. This is a Lagos State site and so the Lagos State\u2019s chain of command and control is from the state Ministry of Health; they are the ones that have taken corpses to the morgue so they are accountable and the people that are moving corpses here are staff of the Lagos State Ministry of Health; the staff that are leading rescue here are staff of LASEMA.\n\n\u201cA dead body is not what you hide; it\u2019s what you take to the morgue and it\u2019s only when it\u2019s accountable from here to the morgue that we have a proper register of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why families were not able to identify their corpses, Sanwo-Olu said autopsies had not been concluded.\n\n\u201cThe coroner inquest takes their turn and the certification by the pathologists are currently going on. We\u2019re pushing them to ensure they can work very quickly to make if not all the bodies but some of the bodies ready by tomorrow (Friday).\n\n\u201cThat is the deadline we have pushed them to so families can come and look and identify the bodies and at the appropriate time take their body away,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, however, said he would give an exception to the man who came from Abuja to check the photographs of the bodies recovered and see if his son was there.\n\nSanwo-Olu noted that the independent panel that would investigate the collapse had been officially inaugurated and given a seal of office.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have all the powers in case they want to summon, ask and engage anybody whatsoever in the course of their investigation to be able to give a thorough objective and transparent advice and recommendations coming out from the investigation panel and they have 30 days turnaround to do their work because of the importance and urgency.\u201d\n\nSource: PUNCH",

          "text": "\u2026Over 34,000 officers, 3 copters, others to secure lives, ballot \u2026 Ensure every single vote counts, INEC boss orders staff \u2026Voter apathy ominous \u2013 Mohammed \u2026Victory ours, APC, PDP, APGA boast \u2026IPC establishes special journalists\u2019 safety monitoring, alert desk\n\nToday, the people of Anambra state will elect one of the 18 candidates as governor. This is despite the security challenges that have envoped the state and indeed the entire South-east region. ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU, TOPE SUNDAY and EMEKA NZE examine the concerns amid calls for a credible poll.\n\nThe threats, attacks, killings\n\nPrior to this day, there were uncertainties about the election. Recall that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had threatened to lock down the entire South-east for six days if its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was not released unconditionally before November 4, 2021.\n\nThe proscribed group, in a statement by its media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, said the failure to release Kanu would attract a one-week sit-at-home from November 5, 2021, till November 10 with the exception of Sunday, November 7, 2021.\n\nThe threat, attacks and continuous killing of Nigerians for about a year sparked anxiety in the state as many feared that the move could make the conduct of the election impossible or bloodier.\n\nPolice\u2019s moves\n\nThe Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has given directive for 34,587 police personnel as well as three police helicopters to be mobilised to the state in order to guarantee a hitch-free exercise.\n\nIn a statement its spokesperson, Frank Mba, the IGP said the overhauling included the deployment of selected seasoned strategic commanders from the rank of assistant commissioner of police and above to Anambra for effective supervision of security personnel and operations in the elections.\n\nThe statement in part, \u201cDIG Egbunike is saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Operation Order evolved from the Election Security Threat Assessment, to ensure a peaceful environment devoid of violence and conducive enough to guarantee that law-abiding citizens freely perform their civic responsibilities without molestation or intimidation.\n\n\u201cDIG Egbunike will be assisted by the DIG in-charge of Operations, Acting DIG Zaki Ahmed. Other strategic commanders deployed to Anambra State include five Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs), fourteen (14) Commissioners of Police (CPs), 31 Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) and 48 Assistant Commissioners of Police (ACPs). The Senior Officers are to coordinate human and other operational deployments in the three Senatorial Districts, 21 local government areas and the 5, 720 polling units in Anambra state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IGP re-assures the nation that the Force is adequately prepared for the Gubernatorial Elections in Anambra state.\n\n\u201cHe reiterates that the Force will do everything within its powers to work with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all stakeholders to protect democratic values, provide level playing field for all political actors, ensure adequate protection of voters, INEC personnel and equipment, accredited observers and other key players in Anambra state.\u201d\n\nThe candidates, total voters, the parties\n\nAccording to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), over 2.5 million registered voters will decide between the 18 candidates and the parties participating in today\u2019s election; these parties and their candidates are: Valentine Ozigbo\u2019s is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Also, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Sen. Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen Ifeanyi Uba as the candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Dr. Obiora Okonkwo would fly the flag of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Others were Obiora Agbasimalo, Labour Party; Dr. Godwin Maduka, Accord Party\u2019s; Bennet Etiaba, ( AA); Chidozie Nwankwo,( AAC); Akachukwu Nwankpo (ADC), Afam Ume-ezeoke (ADP); Geoffrey Onyejegbu (APM); Philip Echetebu (APP), Okeke Chika Jerry (BOOT Party). Leonard Ohajinkpo will contest on the platform of NNPP, Afam Ezenwafor for NRM, Nnamdi Nwawuo for PRP and Obinna Uzoh for SDP.\n\nIPC\u2019s initiative\n\nIn its contribution, the International Press Centre (IPC) Lagos-Nigeria announced the establishment of a Special Journalists\u2019 Safety Monitoring & Alert Desk for journalists and other media professionals covering the poll.\n\nIPC\u2019s executive director, Mr. Lanre Arogundade, said the special alert desk would operate from Friday, November 5 to Sunday, November 7, to cover the immediate pre-election, the election and the immediate post-election periods.\n\n\u201cJournalists have been molested by security agents and political thugs during previous elections despite accreditation by INEC and nothing can be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThe special alert desk will monitor and document the situation of journalists and other media professionals and send out immediate alerts if they encounter problems,\u201d he said.\n\nHe advised journalists and other media professionals on the ground to reach the special alert desk should the need arise as follows: Hotlines: +234 802 362 6281; +234 806 381 0424; +234 813 277 6441;+234 0811 450 3887. Twitter: @IPCng, Facebook: IPC Nigeria.\n\nHe, however, charged journalists covering the election to abide by the provisions of the Nigerian Media Code of Election Coverage requiring adherence to the ethical and professional standards of factual accuracy, discipline of verification, avoidance of disinformation and misinformation, avoidance of hate speech and conflict sensitivity.\n\nINEC\u2019s assurances\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has given the assurance that the election would be credible.\n\n\u201cI want to urge Anambra people to go out and vote the parties of their choice. We have received assurances from the security agencies and they said they are capable of ensuring security for all. On our part, we assure Anambra people it will be free, fair and credible election.\n\n\u201cThe only issue we had was about card transfer. Some people transferred their cards to other local governments and some from other states. But the cards have been printed and sent to all the local government areas for distribution,\u201d he said.\n\nHe directed all staff of the Commission to ensure that \u201cevery vote counts.\u201d Yakubu gave the directive in his message to the Commission\u2019s staff on Friday in Abuja.\n\nHe said despite the challenging situation in the build-up to the election, including attacks on INEC facilities, the Commission\u2019s determination to ensure that the election held as scheduled had been unshaken.\n\nYakubu said in the process, INEC re-built its fixed assets and replaced movable facilities.\n\n\u201cWe also sought and obtained the support of the security agencies, political parties and candidates and all other stakeholders for a successful exercise.\u201d\n\nYakubu reminded the staff that over the next few days, all eyes would be on the commission.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Nigerians expect the Anambra governorship election to be an improvement on the high standards achieved in recent elections. That is why we introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for fingerprint and facial biometric authentication of voters. We have trained staff on the new technology.\u201d\n\nHe added that INEC had also delivered all sensitive and non-sensitive materials for the election on schedule, deployed election duty staff.\n\nYakubu also said INEC made logistics arrangements to move personnel and materials to thousands of locations in Anambra state where voting and collation of results would take place.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative for all of you to ensure that every single vote counts.\n\n\u201cYou must remain true to our commitment that only the voters in Anambra state determine who becomes the next governor.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, you must be guided by the extant laws, our guidelines/regulations and good conscience. You should remain vigilant, principled and committed to the vision and mission of the Commission.\u201d\n\nVoter apathy\n\nA political analyst, Aminu Mohammed, in his take, said with the various attacks, threats and the number of security personnel deployed for the election, voters might lose interest in the process.\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed said: \u201cIn Anambra there is tension everywhere, people are afraid. IPOB threat is there, unknown gunmen problem is there and the security personnel will add to the fear among registered voters.\n\n\u201cWhen people are afraid there is tendency that they will not come out to vote. So, this election may set a new low in voter turnout, in not only the state but in governorship elections nationwide. This is largely because of the worsened insecurity and escalating violence in the state.\n\n\u201cNigerians and stakeholders within and outside Anambra are worried about the security situation in the state and are eager to see how the election will be conducted.\u201d\n\nHowever, a security expert, Emmanuel Johnson, thinks the \u201cheavy presence of security personnel in Anambra state will help build public confidence and ensure credible poll.\u201d\n\nHe said:\u201d I have read on national newspapers and even listened to some persons condemning the deployment of over 30,000 security personnel to Anambra. Some even claimed that a party will use them to rig. But, the question I ask is, what should the federal government do? Fold its hand and watch? Allow the rogue to have their way and prevent a democratic process from taking place?\n\n\u201cYou see, the situation is very tense in the South-east, even more in Anambra perhaps because of the governorship election. For a peaceful and even credible poll, the Nigerian Police, Army, DSS and other security agencies have done well for the heavy deployment of security personnel to Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that some security personnel are used to rigging elections, but most are for a better democratic process. I am optimistic that Anambra people will come out and vote as security personnel and other stakeholders will support INEC to ensure the process is credible and acceptable by the majority.\u201d\n\nPDP\u2019s boasts\n\nIn a chat with this reporter, the national publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kola Ologbondiyan, described Anambra state as \u201ca PDP state,\u201d adding that \u201cValentine Ozigbo will emerge victorious.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan said: \u201cFor us, what is important is the guarantee of peace and security in the process of electioneering. The party has stated clearly that the deployment should not be an intimidation for voters who want to come out and elect their next governor.

They belong to the PDP. As such they are prepared to change the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) that presently exists in Anambra.

          "summary": "\u201cYou must remain true to our commitment that only the voters in Anambra state determine who becomes the next governor.\nIPOB threat is there, unknown gunmen problem is there and the security personnel will add to the fear among registered voters.\nFor a peaceful and even credible poll, the Nigerian Police, Army, DSS and other security agencies have done well for the heavy deployment of security personnel to Anambra.\n\u201cWe are aware that some security personnel are used to rigging elections, but most are for a better democratic process.\nIn as much as the deployment of security personnel is to ensure that there is no breakdown of law and order, it is welcome.",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon.

          "text": "The Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Federal Government from executing its plan to deduct $418 million from the bank account of the 36 states of the Federation.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo issued a restraining order against the Federal Government on Friday following an ex parte application brought by the counsels to the 36 states, Jibril Otukepa and Ahmed Raji.\n\nWhile moving the application, Okutepa who led the legal team of the states told the judge that the states would be completely crippled if the federal government should go ahead to deduct the huge amount from the bank accounts of their clients.\n\nIn 2006, Nigeria paid $12 billion to get a $18 billion debt write-off by the Paris Club of international creditors.\n\nStates and local governments that did not owe the Paris Club, according to reports, later asked for a refund after it was discovered that the payment was made directly from the revenue accruing to the entire federation.\n\nReports later emerged that some consultants, who claimed a percentage of the refunds as payment for services they said they rendered to the states and local governments, went to court in a bid to get their pay.\n\nThe sum of $418 million was agreed as a judgment debt after the Federal Government opted to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with the contractors.\n\nBut this move was rejected by the states who sought redress in court after the Federal Government said it would commence the deduction.\n\nThe Attorneys-General of the 36 states were listed as plaintiffs in the suit filed by their lawyers on October 27.\n\nJoined as respondents included the President, the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Accountant-General of the Federation, and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nOthers were the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Debt Management Office, the Federal Account Allocation Committee, and various commercial banks in the country.\n\nThe states, among others, had also sought an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government, any of its agencies, or any other person from deducting any money due to the states for the payment of any judgement debts arising from contracts and suits in relation to the Paris Club Refund.\n\nThey requested the refund of any money deducted by the government from the Federation Account so far in relation to the issue in dispute, without the express consent of the states.\n\nThe states based the application on 13 grounds, which included that the plaintiffs were the attorneys-general and chief law officers of their respective states as created by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cPart of the deductions in the FAAC summary is for the liquidation of judgement debts in favour of persons who neither had any contractual relationship with the plaintiffs/applicants nor obtained any judgement against any of the plaintiffs/applicants,\u201d the fourth ground of the application read.",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa Plc have been issued an approval by the Central Bank of Nigeria to operate a payment service bank (PSB) in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed on Friday by the two leading telcos in regulatory filings on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).\n\nPSB operators provide financial services through digital means to low-income earners and people that do not use banks or banking institutions for transactions.\n\nAirtel will operate PSB via its Smartcash Payment Service Bank Limited while MoMo Payment Service Bank Limited will be MTN\u2019s PSB. The essence is to bring more people into the financial inclusion space.\n\nAccording to Airtel Africa CEO, Segun Ogunsanya, \u201cI am very pleased that Smartcash has been granted an approval in principle to operate a service bank business in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the operating licence and commence operations.\n\n\u201cThe final operating licence will enable us to expand our digital financial products and reach the millions of Nigerians that do not have access to traditional financial services. I am looking forward to working closely with the Government, the Central Bank and traditional financial institutions to expand financial inclusion and meet the evolving needs of our customers and the economy.\u201d\n\nCompany secretary at MTN Nigeria, Uto Ukpanah, said, MTN Nigeria remained optimistic that it would eventually get the PSB licence.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step in a long process that would lead to eventual approval. In other words, MTN Nigeria would be required to fulfil a number of conditions, even as \u2018the decision to issue a final approval is firmly within the regulatory purview of the CBN\u2019,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria expressed optimism that it would eventually get the PSB license, and reaffirmed its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThis initiative would help about 36 percent of the adult population, representing 38 million citizens, who do not have access to financial services in Nigeria.\n\nThe two firms would be required to fulfil some conditions before CBN will grant an operating license.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray forces are joining with other armed and opposition groups in an alliance against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to seek a political transition after a year of devastating war, organizers say.\n\nThe signing in Washington on Friday includes the Tigray forces that have been fighting Ethiopian and allied forces, as well as the Oromo Liberation Army now fighting alongside the Tigray forces and seven other groups from around the country.\n\nThe alliance is forming as U.S. special envoy Jeffrey Feltman is in Ethiopia\u2019s capital meeting with senior government officials amid calls for an immediate cease-fire and talks to end the war that has killed thousands of people since November 2020. The U.S. said he met with the deputy prime minister and defense and finance ministers on Thursday.\n\nThe new United Front of Ethiopian Federalist Forces seeks to \u201cestablish a transitional arrangement in Ethiopia\u201d so the prime minister can go as soon as possible, organizer Yohanees Abraha, who is with the Tigray group, told The Associated Press late Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe next step will be, of course, to start meeting and communicating with countries, diplomats and international actors in Ethiopia and abroad.\u201d\n\nHe said the new alliance is both political and military. It has had no communication with Ethiopia\u2019s government, he added.\n\nA spokesman for the Oromo Liberation Army, Odaa Tarbii, confirmed the new alliance. When asked whether it meant to force Abiy out, he replied that it depended on Ethiopia\u2019s government and events over the coming weeks. \u201cOf course we prefer if there\u2019s a peaceful and orderly transition with Abiy being removed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to be as inclusive as possible. We know this transition requires all stakeholders,\u201d he added. But as for members of the prime minister\u2019s Prosperity Party, \u201cthere would have to be a process. Many members would have to go through investigation, possibly be prosecuted\u201d for crimes related to the war.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the prime minister, Billene Seyoum, addressed the new alliance Thursday evening when she tweeted that \u201cany outliers that rejected the democratic processes Ethiopia embarked upon cannot be for democratization,\u201d pointing out Abiy\u2019s opening-up of political space after taking office in 2018. His reforms included welcoming some opposition groups home from exile.\n\nThe spokeswoman said she had no further comment Friday, and had no information on whether the prime minister would be meeting with the U.S. special envoy.\n\nThe OLA spokesman in reply to her tweet noted that some of the people who returned to Ethiopia were later put in prison or under house arrest. \u201cA lot of goodwill was lost over the last three years,\u201d he said.\n\nOther groups signing on Friday include the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front, Agaw Democratic Movement, Benishangul People\u2019s Liberation Movement, Gambella Peoples Liberation Army, Global Kimant People Right and Justice Movement/ Kimant Democratic Party, Sidama National Liberation Front and Somali State Resistance, according to organizers.",
