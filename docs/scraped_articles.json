          "text": "Senators operating under the Southern Senators Forum have expressed optimism that 2022 would be a year of abundance and prosperity while they asked the citizens to keep hope in God.\n\nThe Southern Senators Forum, in a statement on Friday by its Chairman, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, for New year Celebration, urged all Nigerians to continue to have faith in God and be rest assured that whatever that is currently difficult will definitely be solved.\n\nHe said Nigeria could only savour the expected economic prosperity and gains when unity is guaranteed and security of lives and property is assured for rapid investment.\n\nHe added that God does not create human beings for hardship because when God created man and woman in the Garden of Eden, they were created in the midst of abundance.\n\nThe governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) said, \u201cI am confident that in the year, there will be prosperity and Abundance for Nigerians. The issue of insecurity and unemployment among our youths will be a thing of the past in this new year.\n\n\u201cI am imploring Nigerians to continue to have faith in God and be rest assured that whatever that is currently difficult at present moment will be resolved.\n\n\u201cGod does not create human beings to suffer, when God created the first man and woman, they were created in the midst of abundance. Therefore, I am rest assured that all our challenges will be tackled in this New year by Almighty God.\u201d\n\nHe also appealed to Nigerians to demonstrate more vigour and a renewed commitment to national unity and sustenance.\n\nHe said though Nigeria had always been having its challenges since pre-independence days, but stated that the widening disunity and insecurity have not assumed this frightening dimension, which it said called for concern and concerted efforts for the country to overcome and become stronger.\n\nHe implored Nigerians to shed all tendencies that could further widen the gulf of disunity among diverse ethnic and religious groups and perceive the present insecurity constituting a forlorn hope to all citizens as a collective battle that must be sustained and won at all cost.",

          "text": "The Spiritual Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Friday, rubbished a publication that accused him of circulating falsehood.\n\nPrimate Ayodele said contrary to the publication, his prophecies often come to pass.\n\nOsho Oluwatosin, the media aide to the popular prophet, reacted to Sahara Reporters\u2019 publication on \u2018Prophecies That Missed The Mark In 2021\u2019.\n\nThe publication tagged \u201cProphecies That Missed The Mark in 2021,\u201d identified five prophecies from Primate Ayodele and claimed was not fulfilled.\n\nHowever, Oluwatosin described the said publication as false.\n\nIn a statement, Osho explained how the prophecies of Primate Ayodele came to pass.\n\nAccording to Osho: \u201cOne of the news outlets I respect so much, Sahara Reporters have continued to disappoint me with false reports against Primate Elijah Ayodele, the leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about it that Primate Ayodele has become a major voice in the prophetic ministry and this was only attained because of the accuracy of his prophecies, all Glory be to God in the highest.\n\n\u201cHowever, Sahara Reporters has continued to deliberately lie against the man of God by dragging his name in the mud of unfulfilled prophecies.\n\n\u201cIn a publication today on the news outlet with the headline \u2018Prophecies That Missed The Mark In 2021\u2019, Primate Ayodele was mentioned among other prophets in Nigeria but unfortunately, instead of doing the reports based on facts, it was totally falsehood peddled against Primate Ayodele.\n\n\u201cSahara Reporters mentioned five prophecies of Primate Ayodele and claim they didn\u2019t come to pass. They include removal of SSG, death of Nigerian ambassador, Covid-19 killing a commissioner, Nigeria producing Covid-19 vaccine, kidnap case in Aso rock.\n\n\u201cSincerely, it is not a must to react to this report because it doesn\u2019t stop God\u2019s work in the life of the very revered man of God but due to the falsehood, there is a need to clear the air for record purposes.\n\n\u201cThe first one the news outlet mentioned is the removal of secretary to the state government. As a news outlet, it is important to always make research before doing any report except it is just a deliberate act to bring down the person of Primate Ayodele. I wonder where Sahara Reporters was when Governor Okowa sacked his SSG in May 2021. In June, Governor Zulum also sacked his SSG. How come Sahara Reporters never saw this?\n\n\u201cSecondly, the news outlet said no Nigerian ambassador died as Primate Ayodele prophesied. If Sahara Reporters know what prophecy is about, they should understand that a true prophet doesn\u2019t receive prophecies and release the same day. For Primate Ayodele, whenever he wants to release a prophetic statement especially for the new year, he takes his time, spends time in God\u2019s presence, sometimes it takes three months to collate the prophecies and when the prophecy was released in December 2020, the Nigerian ambassador to the US died the same month, how come this didn\u2019t come to pass.\n\n\u201cThirdly, on Covid-19 killing a commissioner, if Sahara Reporters took time to understand Primate Ayodele\u2019s ministry, they should know he doesn\u2019t speak on Nigeria alone, his prophecies address the global world. Just yesterday, a commissioner in Lebanon died of Covid-19 complications.\n\n\u201cOn Nigeria producing Covid-19 vaccine, there was nowhere in the prophecy where Primate Ayodele claim it will happen in 2021. This was just falsehood created by Sahara reporters.\n\n\u201cOn Kidnap case in Aso rock, In May, the son of Buhari\u2019s admin officer was kidnapped by gunmen and of course, has ties with the presidential villa.\n\n\u201cSahara reporters have been proven wrong so many times especially when it has to do with Primate Ayodele whose prophetic glory continues to shine beyond the shores of Africa to God\u2019s glory. There is no crime in writing reports but as a news outlet, Sahara Reporters has the responsibility to ensure truth at all times, unfortunately, the reverse has been the case.\n\n\u201cI would advise the publication to uphold the ethics of journalism, work on reports based on facts and not hearsays.\u201d",

          "text": "A cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has disclosed that the current predicament the Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, is facing was caused by his inability to approach men of God for prayers and guidance before embarking on the struggle for self-determination.\n\nPastor Giwa, who is the Senior Pastor of the Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Akure, Ondo State, stated this during a popular radio programme in the state monitored by our correspondent.\n\nWhile disclosing that God revealed the reason for Igboho\u2019s downfall to him following a series of prayers over his situation, he said Ighoho would not have made the mistake if he did the right thing.\n\nAccording to Pastor Giwa, Igboho gave himself out over the unrestricted utterances which he said exposed him to his enemies.\n\nIgboho who had been the face of the Yoruba nation agitation was arrested on July 19 by operatives of Brigade Criminelle (Criminal Brigade) in Cotonou, Benin Republic weeks after his house in Ibadan, Oyo State was attacked and raided by operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS.\n\nWhile describing Igboho as a true Yoruba son, the pastor said he will soon be free from incarceration.\n\n\u201cSunday Igboho has the right to agitate for self-determination of the southwest. Igboho proved to everyone that he is a true son of Yoruba land. He made a bold move to stop killings in some parts of the southwest. He should be commended for his courageous and bold move.\n\n\u201cWhen I spoke to God about Sunday Igboho\u2019s predicament it was revealed to me that there some things he should have done but he didn\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cBefore he embarked on such mission he ought to have approached men of God for prayers and spiritual guidance over his actions and utterances. The mistake that Igboho made was that he made lots of unnecessary utterances and with that, he exposed his weakness.\n\n\u201cBut God will deliver him from the current situation that he is in. God sees his heart and God knows that he is fighting a just cause. We are praying for him,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile baring his mind on the Federal Government\u2019s borrowing, Pastor Giwa said, \u201cBorrowing is not a bad idea, but when you borrow for frivolities, then that becomes dangerous. Borrowing must be used to create an asset.\n\n\u201cProject borrowing, project finance fine. But borrowing to finance consumption is dangerous. It is pity that our President, Muhammadu Buhari does not have the citizens at heart.\n\n\u201cSince we got our independence in 1960, the electricity situation of the country has continued to be epileptic. If the borrowings had given Nigerians constant electricity, the people will be happy. But no one knows the essence of the borrowings.\n\n\u201cEven if the money they are borrowing is genuine, but years of lack of trust between the government and the governed will make the people not to believe them even if the government has good intention.\u201d\n\nGiwa added that \u201cBefore there can be a solution to all the crises in the country, each region must go their separate ways. Nigeria is too large for a single person to manage. Even the federal system of government we claimed to be practising is fraught with insincerity.\n\n\u201cGreediness on the part of many clerics has made them turn blind eye to the rots in the society. Such men of God should recheck their callings.\u201d",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s biggest oil discoveries in 2021",
          "text": "As the lifeblood of industrialised nations, oil and gas are valuable sources of energy that underpin socio-economic development and ensure energy security. Serving as the foundation for the world\u2019s energy and economic development, oil and gas has the potential to eradicate energy poverty while assisting developing nations in their adoption of renewable energy. Africa, positioned as the world\u2019s final frontier for hydrocarbon exploration, has been accelerating its oil and gas exploration activities with significant discoveries made over the past year, marking the beginning of a promising decade for the continent.\n\nDespite the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fossil fuel development and investment, the beginning of the year saw a light oil discovery made by Eni offshore Angola on April 6, in deepwater Block 15/06. Drilled at 500m in the Cuica exploration prospect within the Caba?a Development Area, the discovery holds a potential 200 to 250 million barrels of oil and marks the second significant oil discovery in the area, reaffirming the west-African country\u2019s position as the second largest oil-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nShocking the oil and gas industry following the publication of preliminary results from exploration wells in Namibia\u2019s 6.3-million-acre Kavango Basin, Canadian oil and gas exploration company, Reconnaissance Africa (ReconAfrica), uncovered the potential of a massive oil discovery estimated to contain 120 billion barrels of oil. Sample log results have since provided over 200m of light oil and natural gas indicators, with the well having reached its full depth of 12,500ft in early-July, and the processing and comprehensive interpretation of seismic data in December.\n\nIn May, South African Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Hon. Gwede Mantashe, announced the discovery of pockets of shale gas in the country\u2019s Karoo Basin in the Free State, with estimates suggesting that South Africa holds a potential 390 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. These gas finds have the potential to drive the southern-African country\u2019s economy while diversifying its energy mix and facilitating an energy transition.\n\nRepositioning West Africa in Q3\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurther positioning Ghana as a hydrocarbon hub, an offshore oil discovery made by multinational oil and gas company Eni in CTP Block 4 in July revealed that the Eban-1X well and its surrounding complex holds between 500 and 700 million barrels of oil equivalent. Drilled approximately 50km off the west-African country\u2019s coast, and roughly 8km northwest of the Sankofa Hub, the well was drilled at a water depth of 545m, reaching a total depth of 4,179m, with production testing data suggesting the potential to deliver 5,000 bpd.\n\nDrilling at the Hibiscus North exploration well in Gabon\u2019s Dassafu Block by oil and gas company, BW Energy, in August, encountered a prospect expected to significantly increase the block\u2019s recoverable reserves of 105 million barrels. At a total depth of 336m and encountering approximately 13.5m of oil-bearing reservoir, preliminary results released in September have indicated lower volumes of hydrocarbons than previously expected. However, the prospect still holds the potential of billions of barrels of oil.\n\nMeanwhile, Eni announced on September 1, a major oil discovery off the coast of Cote d\u2019Ivoire with reserves estimated at between 1.5 and 2 billion barrels of oil and approximately 1.8 to 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. With first oil and gas expected by as early as 2023, Eni announced in November plans to fast-track development and operations of the Baleine-1X well, located in Block C1-101, which will drastically enhance the country\u2019s domestic capacity, thus reducing imports.\n\nIn October, Eni once again made three oil and gas discoveries, this time, in Egypt\u2019s western desert region \u2013 holding a potential 50 million barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. Located in the Meleiha and Southwest Meleiha concessions, the discoveries include oil, gas, and condensate reserves, with initial well-testing indicating a stable oil production capacity of up to 2,500 bpd.\n\nIn the same month, Australian gas and oil exploration company, Invictus Energy, appointed Polaris Natural Resources, a Canadian firm, to conduct a seismic survey of the Cabora Bassa Basin, located in the Zambesi Valley in the Muzarabani District, 300km northeast of Harare, Zimbabwe \u2013 which is believed to be one of the most under-explored interior regions on the African continent. Invictus Energy and the Government of Zimbabwe earlier this year signed a petroleum exploration development and production agreement, with the company being granted production rights within the country for the next 25 years.\n\nIn South Africa, the country\u2019s integrated energy and chemical company, Sasol, signed an MoU with the Central Energy Fund in October to accelerate the development of natural gas across the country. With a preliminary focus on long-term energy security and a reduction of imports, the agreement is expected to boost natural gas development and drive economic growth. The outlook of natural gas continued into November for South Africa, with renewable energy company, Renergen, reporting promising results following drilling operations at the country\u2019s sole onshore petroleum plant, its Virginia Gas Project, reportedly discovering significant natural gas deposits. Reporting a 600 percent increase in methane and helium reserves, contents of the well are estimated to contain an estimated 7.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) of helium, and 215.1 bcf of methane.\n\nWith the potential to realise The Gambia\u2019s first oil production, Australian oil and gas firm, FAR, has initiated drilling at its offshore Bambo-1 exploration well in Block A-2, which contains a prospective resource of 1,118 million barrels of oil. The drilling campaign is expected to last approximately 30 days, with the Stena IceMax drillship having arrived on site on 12 November.\n\n\u2022 Culled from Energy Capital & Power",

          "text": "There\u2019s a City of David, not in Jerusalem, but in Uburu, Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. If the biblical City of David was magnificent, this one is no less so. If the earlier was a sight for sore eyes, the latter equally pulls its weight in grandeur.\n\nGovernor Dave Umahi, an accomplished engineer, conceived an ultra-modern state-of-the-art medical university for his state. He turned his idea into action, his dream to reality, and out came spectacular and breathtaking King David University of Medical Sciences, a modern City of David.\n\nThere are some Governors whom my principal, President Muhammadu Buhari loves, irrespective of political parties. Long ago, ever before he joined the All Progressives Congress (APC), Engineer Dave Umahi had always been a special one. Even as a People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Governor, President Buhari had visited Ebonyi in 2017, and stayed the night, something not very common. It was simply because he saw a man making a mark in his domain, and party differences do not matter at that point. Not at all.\n\nKing David University of Medical Sciences is envisioned to develop specialized manpower in all aspects of medicine. It is programmed to provide manpower needs to address the challenge of Human Resources for health in line with new global realities and trends.\n\nIf you can dream it, and apply yourself to it, then you can achieve it. By July this year, the National Universities Commission had approved the academic citadel Umahi dreamt of.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWe have always demanded for world class medical institutions in the country, so that Nigerians do not spend so much on medical tourism. Well, here comes one. In the King David University, there\u2019s a 500-bed teaching hospital, which would compete with the very best in advanced countries of the world. Already, medical equipment are being installed, and best brains being assembled from within and outside the country, to run the facility.\n\nThe hospital, according to Prof Jessy Uneke, Vice Chancellor of the university, will produce dialyzers, a special consumable for kidney dialysis, from mid 2022, and also have an oxygen production plant, for medical and other uses.\n\nThe university is already being touted as the most beautiful campus in Africa (though we that attended University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University, will not readily agree with that). It\u2019s core values are; Excellence, Godliness, Ethics, Compassion, Respect, Delivery, Collaboration, Innovation, Accountability, Learning, Improvement, and Sustainability.\n\nWhat of the Centers being paraded by the university? They include; Maternity and Child Care, Cancer treatment/Oncology, Eye Centre, Dialysis Centre, Laboratory Unit, Radiology, Oxygen Production Plant, Virology and Quarantine Unit, Dental, Pharmacy, among others.\n\nKing David University of Medical Sciences, Uburu, is good thinking, good product. And if you ask me, that is what all our helmsmen in States should do. They should leave their footprints on the sands of time, so that if they aspire for higher offices, the showpiece they have made of their States would stand them in good stead, serve as reference points.\n\nTalking of the hospital, Gov Umahi said: \u201cWe are happy that we have opportunity to change the narrative in this direction, and we are grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the financial support in building the Cancer and Isolation Centers.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer that this institution will close the gap that is causing our people to embark on foreign medical trips/ studies as it is designed to solve medical challenges that take our people outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe Governor thanks President Buhari for his support. That is the man from Daura for you. Anything that will bring positive changes to bear on the lives of the people, he would support. Recall the humongous refund he approved for Federal roads in a state where the Governor is always abusing him. Malice towards nobody, it\u2019s about our country. That is President Buhari for you.\n\nWhere there is no vision, the people perish, says the Good Book, Governor Umahi has the vision of a world class medical university. And he has translated it to action. May we have many more visioners like that in this country.\n\n\u201cThere is a River, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.\u201d (Psalm 46:4). King David University is like that River. It makes us glad. Thank you Governor Umahi. You have ended 2021 on a high, through this project.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "title": "FG Outlines Administration\u2019s 100 Achievements in 2021",
          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, presented the scorecard of President Muhammadu Buhari, citing 100 core achievements of his administration in 2021. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who listed the achievements, said they were despite dwindling revenues, COVID-19 pandemic, and insecurity in several parts of the country induced by insurgency and banditry.\n\nMohammed, who addressed the media in Lagos, said government\u2019s economic recovery plan remained on a steady path throughout 2021. He said the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021 was positive, recording real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 0.51 per cent in the first quarter (Q1), 5.01 per cent in Q2, and 4.03 per cent in Q3.\n\nThe minister said the record was a departure from the declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020, which led to economic recession, put at 1.87 per cent in Q1, -6.10 per cent in Q2, and -3.62 per cent in Q3.\n\nHe said the economic performance in 2021 was a reflection of steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020, arising from government\u2019s policies and strategies, such as the Economic Sustainability Plan and the N500 billion COVID-19 crisis intervention fund, among others.\n\nMohammed stressed that under the Buhari administration, the rate of inflation had continued to decline on a year-on-year basis since April 2021. He said from the trend, a decline was recorded, from 17.93 per cent in May to 17.01 per cent in August, 15.99 per cent in October and 15.40 per cent in November 2021.\n\nHe disclosed that the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning generated N1.53 trillion from Value Added Tax (VAT), while N496.4 billion was generated from VAT in the first three months of 2021, the highest in nine years.\n\nThe minister also said crude oil export improved considerably at N10.03 trillion, compared to N6.92 trillion. This represented a growth rate of 44.93 per cent, despite the fact that real growth showed poorer performance in 2021, recording 2.21 per cent (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, -12.65 per cent in Q2 2021 and \u201310.73 per cent in Q3 2021, from stronger growth of 5.06 per cent in Q1 2020, -6.63 per cent in Q2 2020, and -13.89 per cent in Q3 2020.\n\nAccording to Mohammed, \u201cThe recovery of the economy remained on a steady path throughout the year 2021. As you are aware, gentlemen, many countries around the world face unprecedented challenges, starting from 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Nigeria is no exception.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession. The poor performance of the economy during the COVID-19 era affected output growth, trade, household welfare and livelihood.\u201d\n\nHe said the federal government recovered from the dire conditions by rolling out effective fiscal and monetary policies as well as health plan designed to control the spread of the pandemic and mitigate its negative effects on the economy.\n\nThe minister disclosed that non- oil export grew by 21.17 per cent, from N1.19 trillion to N1.44 trillion over the same period. He said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) carried out various operations across the country to enhance security.\n\nHe said the Joint Task Force, Operation Hadin Kai, covering the restive North-east, neutralised over 1,000 terrorists, rescued 2,000 civilians, and superintended the surrender of over 22,000 terrorists, including their families.\n\nMohammed said during the period under review, the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks, and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding. Various kits were equally provided for troops.\n\nHe said over 1,500 persons were recruited into the Nigerian Navy during the year while the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it conducted several air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops, and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits, and other criminal elements.\n\nOther achievements of the Buhari administration, according to the minister, included passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA); incorporation of NNPC Limited under CAMA; entrenchment of Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) in NNPC; posting of N287 billion profit by NNPC, the first time it will record such profit in 44 years; and the Final Investment Decision on $3.6 billion integrated methanol and gas project in Odioma, Brass Island, Bayelsa State, which was scheduled to come into operation in 2024 and was expected to produce 10,000 tons of methanol daily.\n\nOhers were the $260 million Funding Agreement for ANOH Gas Processing Company Limited (AGPC), a project that would deliver 300 million standard cubic feet of gas per day and 1,200 megawatts of electricity to the domestic market, and the launch of Nigerian Upstream Cost Optimisation Programme (NUCOP) to drive down the cost of crude oil production in the country and make Nigeria competitive in the global market.\n\nMohammed also listed the award of $1.5 billion contract for the rehabilitation of Port Harcourt Refinery to Tecnimont SPA of Italy; construction and rehabilitation of 21 roads under the federal government\u2019s Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme; construction of Kano-Maiduguri Road Section II (100.08 kilometres, (Shuwarin-Azare) in Jigawa and Bauchi States, Kano-Maiduguri Road Section III (Azare-Potiskum) 106.34 kilometres in Bauchi and Yobe states, Vandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road Phase I and II (24 kilometres) in Benue and Cross River states, Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (304 kilometres), 360-metre bridge at Ikom in Cross River State, which had been completed and now awaiting commissioning, 400-metre border bridge between Nigeria and Cameroon, which was also completed and awaiting commissioning, and Second Niger Bridge, now 78 per cent complete and expected to be ready in November 2022.\n\nMohammed also cited the designation of four international airports in Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt as Special Economic Zones, aimed at encouraging business/investment, the procurement of two mobile control towers in Lagos and Abuja airports, and the provisional approval, which the Ministry of Aviation received for the establishment of Aerospace University in Abuja.\n\nHe also listed the flag-off of the commercial operation of Lagos-Ibadan rail line in June 2021 and the signing of the MoU with Portuguese company, Mota-Engil Group, for the construction of $1.959 billion Kano-Maradi standard gauge railway lines, as well as the ground-breaking ceremony for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the 2,044-kilometre Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Narrow Gauge Railway project and Bonny Deep Sea and Railway Industrial Park, in addition to the ground-breaking ceremony of the Kano-Kaduna Standard Gauge Rail-line Modernisation project.\n\nThe minister said 12 dams were completed in a bid to maximise dam infrastructure, while 96,000 hectares of irrigation land were developed in 2021. He noted there was a review of the Expatriate Quota fees, which ensured generation of additional revenue for the federal government.\n\nHe praised the Buhari administration for approving Legal Notices, which allowed local governments to conduct Statutory Marriages sequel to compliance with regulations by the Ministry, in line with the Marriage Act of 1958 as amended. He also commended the president for approving the National Action Plan to end statelessness in Nigeria, as required by the UN, the launch of the new visa policy reclassifying the visa categories from six to 79, and processing of visa on arrival to holders of passports of African countries.\n\nThe minister also credited the administration for the Passport Issuance Reform, which ensured the clearing of a backlog of 96,083 passport applications between January and September this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Restates few people squandered region\u2019s fund in over two decades\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Okon Bassey in Uyo\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to recover all misappropriated funds of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Buhari also emphasised the readiness of his administration to prosecute all culprits indicted in the NDDC forensic report currently being reviewed by the federal government.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, during the virtual inauguration of the NDDC Prototype Hostel at the University of Uyo, the president declared, \u201cThe serial abuse, lack of delivery and what had become an entrenched institutional decay, was the reason why I called for the forensic audit.\n\n\u201cTherefore, going forward, we shall ensure every recoverable kobo is recovered for use in service of the people of this region and those found culpable shall face the law.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that a few people had squandered the special development fund for the region for more than 20 years, leaving many in penury.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission needs to demonstrate that it can achieve the objectives it was conceived for and make its impact felt all over the Niger Delta Region.\n\n\u201cThe lives of the people of the Niger Delta could be so much better, if the funding received by this commission since its inception, in billions of naira over the last 20 years, have been judiciously deployed in service of the people.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I want to use the opportunity of this commissioning to direct all statutory contributors to the NDDC to remit all outstanding funds to the Commission, and to ensure this is done transparently and according to laid down procedure and process.\u201d\n\nBuhari also directed that all abandoned projects that directly impacted the livelihood of the people should be revived and completed.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWhen I directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs to institute a forensic audit of the commission, after many representations by major stakeholders in the Niger Delta, I had also directed that all viable projects, which had been abandoned, but which would impact positively on the lives and livelihoods of the people, be immediately revived and completed\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the contract for the building of 1,050 capacity hostel for male and female students was awarded in 2004, saying like many others, it was abandoned.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis prototype university hostel consists of 1,050 bed spaces, 525 each for males and females, and is furnished to meet the needs of a university student. The complex also boasts of significant hard and soft infrastructure to ensure its sustainability and durability.\n\n\u201cThe completion of this structure is equally in recognition of the importance government attaches to providing quality housing and improved education for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, another important proof that this administration is committed to satisfying the needs of the people, throughout Nigeria, and fulfilling their expectations. Government must continue in its efforts to serve the people, by providing amenities, as well as the enabling environment for scholarships, investments across all sectors, for sustenance of the environment, and overall growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cSignificant part of this success story is that it could easily not have happened. The contract for this hostel was awarded as far back as 2004. It was one of many projects abandoned across the Niger Delta region, but which I directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to expeditiously complete and put to use.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Buhari said across many public universities and institutions of higher learning, students faced accommodation challenges, while private investors took advantage of the gap to provide accommodation, unfortunately, tasking the resources of parents and guardians.\n\nHe said, \u201cMany of them are located far away from school premises and come with their own peculiar challenges. It is good that such an infrastructure gap is being addressed, by providing accommodation for students that would be affordable, well built, and in a secure environment.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, had on his behalf commissioned the Special Protections Unit Base 6 Barracks in Omagwa, Rivers State, which was built and donated to the Nigeria Police by the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirstly, and as stated at that occasion, the complex is part of a crucial component of the major reform we are undertaking with the Nigerian Police Force. While we are working to increase the number of police personnel, within set yearly targets, and re-equip personnel, both in personal gear and hardware, accommodation remains an important feature of that reform.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it showed that we can alleviate the accommodation challenges of senior security personnel in order to enhance security in the region.\n\n\u201cSecondly, this singular intervention demonstrates that NDDC understands the importance of government\u2019s effort at improving the lives and livelihoods of our police officers, in line with my directive that building of barracks for men and women of the police force should be done in collaboration with the Special Housing effort of the Family Home funds.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his speech, Akpabio said the completion of the NDDC headquarters complex and other projects clearly showed the president\u2019s commitment to improving the livelihood of people in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe added, \u201cPresident Buhari is focused on development of Nigeria and the Niger Delta. The president wants to ensure that by the time he leaves office, the NDDC is repositioned to live up to the expectations of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, who was represented by the Commissioner for Power and Petroleum Development, Dr. John Etim, praised the president over the completion and commissioning of the hostel.\n\nSpeaking also, Sole Administrator of NDDC, Mr. Effiong Akwa, thanked the president for honouring the institution by commissioning three projects in a year.\n\n\u201cThe three projects have one thing in common, they were all abandoned before the forensic audit,\u201d Effiong added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says high debt service cost to raise FG spending in 2022\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nEvery Lagos resident would have spent over six years in traffic by the time they clock 55 years, a new report by the Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) Limited, has indicated.\n\nThe state has one of the worst traffic gridlocks in the world, as commuters spend hours on the road, losing a significant part of their productive time before arriving at their destinations.\n\nFDC, led by Nigerian economist, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, also highlighted in its latest report published this month the economic outlook for 2022. The Lagos-based research and investment firm stated that while Lagos residents spent 1,080 hours in traffic a year, residents of London, which is said to have the highest congestion in the world, spent about 148 hours.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cLagosians are spending approximately 1,080 hours a year in traffic, compared to 148 hours in London, the city with the worst traffic jams in the world (excluding Nigeria and Egypt).\n\n\u201cThis comes to 12.5 per cent of the time in a year. It also translates to 6.76 years in a life expectancy of 55 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, compared to Lagos\u2019 1,080 hours, residents of Paris spend 140 hours in traffic, Brussels (134), Palermo (109), Moscow (108), Rome (107), Chicago (104), Lyon (102), New York (102), and Bucharest (98).\n\nDespite efforts by successive governments to solve the traffic challenge in Lagos, there has been no major breakthrough, as residents languish for hours in the intractable hold-ups, wasting several man-hours.\n\nResearch organisations, like SBM Intelligence, had suggested an upgrade of the infrastructure in the water transport sector to encourage commuters to patronise boats and ferries to reduce the perennial traffic congestion in Lagos.\n\nOther studies had advocated a mass movement mode of transportation, like the rail system, to move people in one of the world\u2019s most populated cities.\n\nIn other issues, the FDC report stated that economic policy vagueness and \u201cregulatory autocracy\u201d plagued the Nigerian economy for most part of 2021.\n\nIt stated, \u201cIt was a year best described as \u2018in like a lion, and out like a lamb\u2019. But in reality, it was almost the opposite because of mixed signals.\n\n\u201cThe economic growth maintained a slow and steady path as was expected but could be threatened by a rude interruption of the Omicron variant and the spectre of precision lockdowns.\n\n\u201cThis notwithstanding, Nigerians are still frustrated with data that shows falling inflation in an environment of higher prices.\u201d\n\nIn the Christmas edition of the monthly report, the FDC further extrapolated possible exchange rate scenarios based on oil price sensitivity, giving an external boundary of N610/$ and an optimistic scenario of N530/$.\n\nStressing that some of the economic imponderables were becoming clearer, the firm noted that just as the US fed was determined to increase interest rates three times in 2022 and the Bank of England had pushed up its policy rate to 0.25 per cent per annum, the implication of higher dollar interest rates was an excruciating external debt service burden for Nigeria, compounded by the subsidy overhang.\n\nOn the oil market, the FDC projected an optimistic oil price of $70-$75 and a $60 to $65 negative scenario for the first half of 2022, while oil production would hit 1.55 million barrels per day in a positive scenario and 1.3 million barrels per day in a negative scenario.\n\nIt predicted that fuel subsidy removal by the second quarter would take the price of the product to between N320 and N350 per litre while government spending on imports of petroleum products could taper from the last quarter of next year.\n\nIt also predicted a positive balance of trade at -$1.90 billion and a negative scenario of -$9 billion, while external reserves would increase to $42 to $43 billion for a positive projection and $35 billion in a pessimistic analysis.\n\nAccording to the report, while government revenue was estimated to increase in 2022, on the back of improved tax revenue and proceeds from subsidy removal, fiscal deficit would narrow to 2.8 per cent in 2023 from 3.7 per cent in 2020.\n\nHowever, the FDC stated that high debt servicing costs, large public wage bill and security expenses would keep government spending elevated throughout the period.\n\nWith public finances remaining in deficit on lower oil revenues, FDC projected that this would negatively impact the implementation of capital infrastructure projects, like rail and roads, even as debt-servicing costs to revenue will stay above 75 per cent.\n\nIn addition, it stated that inflation would remain stubbornly high, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will remain positive while the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will be more intentional about exchange rate reforms and increasing foreign exchange supply.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has directed churches in Kaduna State to suspend this year's Christmas Eve services.\n\nCAN gave the directive amidst escalating terror killings and kidnappings by bandits in the state, saying pre-Christmas services, usually held during nightfall to herald the birth of Jesus Christ should not hold this year.\n\nCAN chairman in Kaduna state, Rev. John Joseph Hayap, told SaharaReporters that \"leaders of the Christian body were perturbed by the spike in violent crimes being perpetrated against Christians in the North\".\n\nHe added, \"Yes, we have written to churches to suspend this year's Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve events because of security concerns.\n\n\"We took this decision because the government of Nigeria and its security agents have failed the Christian community.\n\n\"All they do is to make press statements expressing sadness anytime our people are killed; we're tired of that.\n\n\"However, in areas our people feel they can afford to congregate for Christmas Eve services, they should do so under security measures. Even at that, all services must end before 6:00 pm.\"\n\nSaharaReporters on November 29, 2021, reported that a group of bandits had written to the Christian community in Zamfara State, Northwest Nigeria to close churches or risk ferocious attacks.\n\nAlso on December 15, 2021, it was reported that the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP)'s faction of Boko Haram terrorists had sent threat letters to some communities in Adamawa State, saying it would attack during the Christmas season.\n\nTo allay the fears of Christmas season attacks as threatened by the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), the Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri spent three days in some of the communities under threat.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that Fintiri on Friday, December 17, 2021, embarked on a three-day confidence-boosting visit to the area.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says the deteriorating security situation has resulted in a humanitarian emergency, with more than 8.7 million people requiring urgent assistance in northern Nigeria.\n\nIt further says, \"Since 2011, inter-communal violence, rooted in competition over scarce resources, has escalated in central and north-west Nigeria.\n\n\"Violence between herding and farming communities has become increasingly deadly as a result of the proliferation of armed groups and gangs who engage in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape.\n\n\"The emergence and expansion of armed banditry in the north-west resulted in at least 4,900 people killed between 2018-2020 and has displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\n\"Kidnappings by armed extremist groups and bandits have become endemic in northern Nigeria, with more than 950 children kidnapped since December 2020. More than 200 students remain missing.\"",

The lawmakers later increased the budget size to N17.127 trillion.\n\nIn his remarks after signing the budget, Buhari said the lawmakers reduced the amount allocated to some projects \u2014 but added 6,576 projects of their own to the 2022 budget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the worrisome changes are as follows:\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some MDAs, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari also expressed concern in the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including \u201cN12.6 billion in the ministry of transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing rail modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from power sector reform programme under the ministry of finance, budget and national planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the ministry of agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this ministry and its agencies\u201d.\n\n\u2018\u2018Inclusion of new provisions totalling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of powers and financial autonomy of the legislative arm of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Many more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe declared that it was surprising that despite the national assembly increasing projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of national assembly.\n\nThe president said that he would revert to the national assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the house resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to his administration do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed reservations over the \u201cworrisome changes\u201d made by the national assembly to the 2022 executive budget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, the president signed the N17.13 trillion 2022 appropriation bill into law.\n\nThe presidency had submitted a proposal worth N16.391 trillion to the national assembly. The lawmakers later increased the budget size to N17.127 trillion.\n\nIn his remarks after signing the budget, Buhari said the lawmakers reduced the amount allocated to some projects \u2014 but added 6,576 projects of their own to the 2022 budget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the worrisome changes are as follows:\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some MDAs, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari also expressed concern in the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including \u201cN12.6 billion in the ministry of transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing rail modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from power sector reform programme under the ministry of finance, budget and national planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the ministry of agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this ministry and its agencies\u201d.\n\n\u2018\u2018Inclusion of new provisions totalling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of powers and financial autonomy of the legislative arm of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Many more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe declared that it was surprising that despite the national assembly increasing projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of national assembly.\n\nThe president said that he would revert to the national assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the house resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to his administration do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.",

But we have achieved that very significant important date of signing before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe reality is what I have observed, the ability of the federal government to have his budget passed and signed before the end of the year, has made so many states to also work towards achieving that.\u201d\n\nLawan said the issues raised by the president on how the budget was appropriated are not a \u201cworrisome development for us\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is based on judgments when we asked for more resources coming from the independent sources, especially from the government owned enterprises of about N400 to N500 billion because we believe that these government owned enterprises should contribute even much more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I hold the opinion that they should have contributed about a trillion, at least not N500 billion or so.\u201d",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021!

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns. What do you expect to see in 2022? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "Web3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve come across the buzzword, non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet, chances are you have also seen the latest buzzword \u2014 Web3. Both words are generated by proponents of blockchain technology and crypto heads who believe it is the future of the Internet.\n\nAlthough some people like Elon Musk have said the word is a mere \u201cmarketing buzzword than reality right now,\u201d a deeper look at it suggests it could change not just the Internet but the world economy as we know it. But before I suggest that Musk could be wrong and sound like a crypto head myself, what exactly is Web3?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting web3 is real \u2013 seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now \u2013 just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2021\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is simply the Internet that belongs to everyone. A decentralised World Wide Web owned by no one but run based on everyone\u2019s decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what Web3 is and the rationale behind its formation, it is important to start from the beginning \u2014 the first and second generations of the web and how they\u2019re different from the imminent third generation.\n\nWeb1: The beginning\n\nWeb1 is the earliest version of what we call the Internet today. According to a 2014 paper by Nupur Choudhury, World Wide Web and Its Journey from Web 1.0 to Web 4.0, the Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1989. He envisioned the Web in three ways: a Web of documents (Web1), a Web of people (Web2) and a Web of data (Web3).\n\nIt is accurately referred to as \u201cread-only web\u201d as there were very few visuals besides text. Unlike today\u2019s Internet that allows users to interact with information online, users of Web1 were more passive and only read things online.\n\nThere was no comment section like you have on the Techpoint Africa website or Twitter or Facebook where you air your views or share your opinion about someone else\u2019s. To get an excellent example of what Web1 is like, visit Cameron\u2019s World, a web-collage of text and images from 1994 to 2009. Another great example will be what CNN used to look like in 2000.\n\nBerners-Lee is a British scientist who worked at Organisation Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN). He submitted the proposal for what is known as the Internet today as an effective communication system at CERN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim-Berners-Lee. Source: Britannica\n\nHowever, Berners-Lee realised that what he had proposed was far more powerful than just being a communication system within CERN but for the whole world. He and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, decided to connect information on the Web with hypertext and the Internet was formed.\n\nInterestingly, the first iteration of the Internet was very different from what we have now. To millennials or Gen Zs, Web1 was more or less looking at an offline doc.\n\nWeb2: Current dispensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nBy 2004 the era of Web1 was about to fade away and the second iteration of the Internet was on its way. It would mark the beginning of user-generated content on the web. The same way Web3 is causing a stir now on the Internet, the coming of Web2 also did the same thing. It was dubbed a movement and a new wave of social services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the words of Tim O\u2019 Riley, Co-Founder of the O\u2019Riley Media and the man who popularised the term Web2, \u201cWeb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.\n\n\u201cChief among those rules is this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better the more people use them.\u201d\n\nWeb2 was truly transformative; it birthed social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which have dominated online social interactions to date. Cloud computing, eCommerce, financial services and many of the things we enjoy on the Internet today were only possible with the creation of Web2.\n\nAlthough Web2 stirred as much excitement as Web3 is doing now, people calmed down when Web2 became an everyday thing.\n\nThis is Web3\n\nWeb3 underpins the idea behind the creation of cryptocurrencies which is simply decentralisation. The technologies behind cryptocurrency, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also be a crucial part of Web3.\n\nLike Web2, Web3 wants to make the Internet more inclusive but, in contrast, take control away from big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It aims to do this by decentralising the Internet.\n\nMat Dryhurst, a Berlin artist and a proponent of the Web3 revolution, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of companies that own all this stuff, and then there\u2019s us who use it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we don\u2019t have anything to show for it.\u201d\n\nBut how will Web3 give people control of the Internet? We\u2019re already seeing a glimpse of how Web3 will work with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anyone and every data on the Bitcoin network is not in a single place, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nWhat to prepare for with Web3\n\nWith Web3, user data on the Internet is not held by Google or Facebook; it\u2019s on a blockchain that belongs to everyone. According to Business Insider Africa, you\u2019ll only need a single account to do anything on the Internet. For example, the same account will be used for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Jumia, Bolt, and even Techpoint Africa.\n\nBasically, all of the applications and websites online will be decentralised. So, we\u2019ll log in to these applications the same way we use the Web3 wallet, Metamask, to log into blockchain platforms like decentralised finance.\n\nFor example, to buy or upload an NFT on OpenSea, an NFT market, you only need to connect your Metamask wallet, and it identifies you. The same Metamask wallet can be used to log in to other NFT marketplaces like Rarible and SuperRare. In fact, decentralised finance platforms (DeFi), decentralised exchanges (DEX) and virtually every Web3-enabled application will work with that same wallet.\n\nAnother huge part of Web3 will be artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI works with Web2, the third generation of the Internet will help AI understand the content on the web the same way humans do, making AI a lot smarter. In an example by CoinMarketCap, AI will not just understand words but the emotions behind the words with something called Semantic Web, a writing standard on the web that makes online content readable for AI and machines.\n\nIt is important to note that a large part of what Web3 is said to be capable of hasn\u2019t been seen or tested. However, many venture capitalists seem to believe strongly in the Web3 future.\n\nThis year alone, $27 billion has been raised by Web3-related startups, which is over 1,200% more than what the whole African startup ecosystem raised in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nGetting started with Web3 in 2022\n\nAlthough the idea of Web3 isn\u2019t fully formed, platforms that embody the concept already exist, and they\u2019re creating sources of collaboration and income for people. Such platforms include decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse.\n\nHowever, there are financial and educational barriers to entering these platforms as they\u2019re very new and complicated. So, the first step to getting started with Web3 will be learning, for instance, knowing how to get into the world of non-fungible tokens.\n\nWhile Web3 might be a new concept, there\u2019s quite enough content about it on the Internet, and a quick Google search could do a lot of wonders.\n\nWhen it comes to earning with Web3, on the other hand, a quick search on the Internet might not cut it. However, gaming seems like the least risky way to profit from the new Internet iteration.\n\nIn Africa, platforms like the Metaverse Magna have made it easy to profit from crypto gaming with their scholarship programme. It provides players with the assets they need to compete on crypto gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity, where they can earn up to $2,000 a month.\n\nA career in Web3 is also another path to profiting from it in 2022. Web3 and blockchain experts are in high demand as the field is still new. Dapp University is a great place to start learning about careers within Web3.\n\nWhile Web3 might be the shiny new future of the Internet, only time will tell if it will deliver on its many promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "More money for power sector as DisCos ramp up collection",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s electricity distribution companies (DisCos) have vastly improved their ability to collect revenue from customers, improving liquidity in a cash-strapped power sector and raising hopes for new investments.\n\nA new cache of data released by the electricity regulator, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), indicates that the DisCos have generally improved collection efficiency across the various tariff bands by 70 percent on average.\n\nThis has also translated to improved remittance to the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) who now has half of their invoices settled by DisCos rather than around 30 percent that was previously remitted.\n\nAnalysis of the collection pattern shows that DisCos are prioritising distribution of power to areas where customers are both willing and able to pay. The biggest collections emanated from customers under the highest cost tariff classes.\n\nCustomers in tariff band A who enjoy up to 20 hours of supply daily settled 92 percent of their market invoice. Customers under the Lifeline band, where mostly poorly served customers are placed, accounted for 34 percent of collections.\n\nRead Also: Discos forfeit N3 from every N10 worth of energy \u2013 NERC\n\nThe NERC introduced the Service Reflective Tariff (SRT) plan in July 2020, but it could not take effect until December due to the challenges with COVID-19 and labour protests.\n\nUnder the SRT, customers are grouped in different tariff bands according to the number of hours of power supplied daily, with the highest receiving 20 hours or more, paying between N45 and N55kwh, and the poorest people getting less than four hours of supply daily and seeing no increase in their tariff.\n\nBetween January and August 2020, DisCos settled barely 25 percent of their market invoices, a development that threatened the survival of other market participants such as generation companies (GenCos), gas companies, and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) who wheels generated power to the DisCos.\n\nDisCos remittances never agree with the value of the power they received. For example, between January and September 2020, the DisCos received electricity valued at N513.2 billion but were only able to pay back N121.3 billion of the market invoice, which is just 22 percent of the invoice according to data from the NBET.\n\nThis has since improved as the NERC data show. NBET issued a market invoice worth N614.5 billion in 2021 and received N311 billion as settlement, representing an improvement by 50.6 percent.\n\nAhmed Zakaria, special adviser to the President on Infrastructure, told BusinessDay that this was an indication that the reforms in the sector were having an impact. \u201cWe hope to sustain this growth,\u201d he said in a phone interview when BusinessDay began tracking collections after the service-based tariffs were introduced.\n\nWhile this is a significant improvement, it does not mean that the sector is fully restored to profitability. The regulator, NERC, prescribed a minimum remittance obligation of between 36 and 40 percent, and only a handful of DisCos have been able to meet the threshold in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has through the applicable orders set a minimum remittance threshold for each DisCo having adjusted for their tariff shortfall. It is obvious that DisCos need to improve on their performance,\u201d the regulator said in its second quarter report of 2021, which shows none of the DisCos met the remittance threshold.\n\nImproved collections are already translating to higher remittance and this could open the sector up for new investment opportunities, according experts.\n\nAccording to the NERC, customers across the six tariff bands \u2013 A to E and the Lifeline bands were billed N100.3 billion for energy supplied in 2021 and DisCos were able to collect over N85.164 billion, representing 85 percent of energy billed.\n\nThe average collection efficiency has been driven up to 70 percent from less than 50 percent before the new tariff model was introduced.\n\nAnother significant indicator of improved collections is that \u2013 tariff bands A and B accounted for 92 percent and 85 percent collection efficiency.\n\nFindings also show that supply has generally improved across the DisCos, especially in city centres where metering has seen an uptick. With wider deployment of prepaid meters, DisCos are keener to ensure that customers have power.\n\n\u201cAt best, improvements have been modest,\u201d said Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer and founder of Bloomfield law firm in his assessment of the power sector this year.\n\nThey have also stepped up monitoring of prepaid meters to guard against energy theft. Ikeja Electric proposed rewarding a whistle-blower with part of the re-connection penalty paid by the culprit\n\nDisCos are also deploying technology to make payment solutions easier. Many customers now pay through an energy application by a third-party vendor or even through their mobile banking apps.\n\nTechnical issues that hitherto deny many access to power have been brought to some form of control. The national grid, which suffered full collapse nine times, according to NERC\u2019s record, only saw one full collapse between January and September 2021.\n\nWhile meter reforms have only seen modest additions, crazy billings remain a sore point in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe huge metering gap for end-use customers is still a key challenge in the industry,\u201d NERC noted.\n\nThe regulator said of the 11,058,939 registered energy customers as of June 30, 2021, only 4,529,497 (40.95%) have been metered. This implies that out of every 10 registered electricity customers, six are without meters, thus on estimated billing.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the 11 DisCos received 241,476 complaints from consumers, and 38.69 percent were on billing (17.71) and metering (20.98).",

          "title": "Why Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is project to watch",
          "text": "For several reasons, the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is a major infrastructure project to watch in 2022. One of the reasons is that the 13-year-old reconstruction work on the expressway is expected to end in 2022.\n\nThe Federal Government has, on many occasions, assured that work on the expressway would be completed in 2022. This assurance was reiterated recently when Olukayode Popoola, federal controller of works in Lagos, gave reasons for the six-day closure of a section of the expressway in November 2021 to enable the contractor to do his work.\n\nThe completion of the expressway, according to the government and infrastructure development experts, would mean a big boost for the economy and a huge relief for motorists.\n\nThe Lagos-Ibadan Expressway benefits from the Federal Government\u2019s Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), which Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, says holds opportunities and economic benefits for Nigeria and its citizens.\n\nThe Expressway is one of the 12 federal highways with a combined length of 1,963km the Federal Government had concessioned under the initiative.\n\nThe other highways are Benin-Asaba, Abuja-Lokoja, Kano-Katsina, Onitsha-Owerri, Shagamu-Benin, Abuja-Keffi-Akwanga, Kano-Shuari, Potiskum-Damaturu, Lokoja-Benin, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Ilorin-Jebba, Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta, and the Lagos-Badagry-Seme Border highway.\n\nRead Also: FG\u2019s infrastructure spend in 6years yields 13,000km of roads \u2013 Fashola\n\nOf these highways, Lagos-Ibadan is the most viable economically, being the busiest, the major gateway to other parts of the country, particularly the East and North, and the main facilitator of East-West trade and commerce.\n\nFashola explained that, as an indigenous Land Value Capture scheme aimed to develop Nigeria\u2019s network of federal highway corridors and boost economic development along the right of way (RoW), HDMI is expected to create thousands of jobs for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe initiative will open up the highway economy with opportunities in various economic activities, including fabrication of gantries and directional signages with advertising opportunities, towing van operations and auto repair stations, operation of rest areas and emergency services, among others,\u201d he said.\n\nExpectation is that, through HDMI, the Federal Government would leverage private sector funding and participation in the development and maintenance of critical infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe initiative, according to the minister, would deliver a safer and enjoyable travel experience for Nigerian road users as travel time would be shortened, cost reduced and commercial activities stimulated.\n\nThese are experiences that await motorists as reconstruction tapers to an end on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway where stress and delay define daily motoring and commuting experience.\n\nBesides the HDMI scheme, the Expressway also promises huge revenue for the government as it will benefit from the government\u2019s decision to reintroduce toll gates on highways about 18 years after former President Olusegun Obasanjo administration dismantled them across the country.\n\nThe administration scrapped the tollgates, citing corruption. It explained that daily returns of N63 million from the tollgates were not enough, considering the corruption and the inconvenience motorists experienced at such tollgates.\n\nWhile receiving the Outline Business Case Certificate of Compliance for the 12 pilot federal highways billed for the concession, the minister confirmed the decision to reintroduce tolling on the highways, saying the issuance of the certificate signified the return of the tollgates as concessionaires have to recoup their investments.\n\nGodwin Odinta, an infrastructure development expert, explained to BusinessDay that reintroducing tollgates on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway would create multiple jobs for both skilled and unskilled labour to be drawn from the surrounding towns and villages.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to plan the toll gates; people are also going to provide the needed infrastructure; there will be people to man the infrastructure while other people will provide security around the operations at the tollgates,\u201d Odinta noted.\n\nThough Joseph Akinteye, former vice president of Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE), said Nigeria was not yet ripe for tolling its roads because \u201cwe don\u2019t have the technology for maintaining such facilities,\u201d but Dayo Oluyemi, chairman, Nigerian Institution of Highways Transportation Engineers, sees the need for the tolling.\n\n\u201cThe entire road network in Nigeria needs alternative sources of funding or there would not be any road again in the country. One of the alternative sources of funding is tolling the road, which is what the government plans to do,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdedamola Kuti, director of Federal Highways, South West, disclosed that efforts were being intensified to complete projects like the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, adding that designs for the four tollgates were being tidied up.\n\nAccording to Kuti, the toll gates would not be sited in the previous locations, but would be located immediately after Kara Bridge, before NNPC filling station, another one after the interchange on the Sagamu end, while another one will be towards Ibadan.\n\nSince April 15, 2009, when late Dora Akunyili as minister of information and communication, announced after a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting that the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway had been concessioned, the Expressway has been under reconstruction, making it one of the most enduring construction sites in Nigeria.\n\nThe concessionaire on the 105-kilometre road that was constructed in 1974 was Bi-Courtney Highway Services Limited (BCHSL). It was concessioned at the cost of N89.53 billion for a period of 25 years under a Design, Build, Operate and Transfer (DBOT) scheme.\n\nBut the concessioning turned out to be an agreement that never was, as it was cancelled three years after and the contract for the reconstruction awarded to two contractors\u2014Julius Berger and RCC\u2014who have been working on the Expressway for over a decade now.",

          "text": "The year 2021 started with high hopes especially for manufacturers as they expected a rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the active participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which kicked off in January.\n\nUnfortunately, things didn\u2019t go as planned because inherent challenges further intensified, while different policies and actions adverse to business activities and trade policies sprung up locally, regionally and globally.\n\nOkhai Ehimigbai, export executive at Aarti Steel, said the year did not go as expected as challenges intensified and worsened the manufacturers\u2019 plight.\n\nMany manufacturers were forced to retrench workers as they could not cope with the rising cost, he said, and some companies suspended operations.\n\n\u201cThis year was not a good year as we had expected; in fact, we went from frying pan to fire because as challenges intensified, we managed to produce but there was poor demand for goods,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: Low capacity utilisation limiting manufacturers\u2019 profits\n\nHe noted that business owners in Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector continued their struggle with numerous challenges including access to foreign exchange, exchange rate depreciation, high inflationary pressures, crisis at the ports, high cost of government-generated electricity and alternative provisions, and insecurity as the most critical challenges for businesses.\n\nFrom the first quarter to the third quarter of the year, the manufacturing GDP performed optimally, achieving 3.4 percent, 3.49 percent, and 4.29 percent, respectively, but experts however faulted these figures, stating that it did not reflect realities in the sector.\n\n\u201cThere is no recorded high level of economic activities in the sector that would justify such a growth rate, as manufacturers are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs,\u201d Segun Ajayi-Kadir, director-general, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), said.\n\nManufacturers during the year experienced higher production costs due to issues around cuts in international supply, scarcity of raw materials, unfriendly exchange rate, FX scarcity, etc.\n\nThis forced manufacturers to source for inputs locally, which also was a struggle due to rising insecurity, bad roads, and poor infrastructure to preserve raw materials, etc.\n\nThis discouraged production activities as cost pressure intensified without an outlet, as consumers\u2019 purchasing power declined.\n\nMAN CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) for the second quarter of 2021 showed that between April and June, production and distribution costs increased by 21 percent, manufacturing investment declined by 15 percent, capacity utilisation volume of production and sales volume declined by 8 percent as well.\n\nAlso, in June 2021, a transit duty was imposed by Benin Republic on goods on transit passing through the country by road, which is estimated at an average of N9 million per truck. This, according to experts, significantly hurt trade across the West African sub-region.\n\nThese challenges and more also damped efforts to participate in the ongoing AfCFTA, as Nigerian manufacturers lacked the ability to compete with other countries, especially electricity supply and right policies.\n\nMajor highlights of the year\n\nClosure/suspension of businesses: Although numbers have not been stated officially, a lot of manufacturing firms were forced to shut down in 2021, while some suspended operations as the weight of challenges enveloped them.\n\nEhimagbai told BusinessDay that a lot of manufacturing firms in Ota, Ogun State, closed down as they could not continue operations, just a part of many others across the country.\n\nSome companies expanded production: Constantly-changing consumer preferences, environmental and global conditions forced some manufacturers to rethink business strategies, refine goods produced and services rendered in order to meet changing demand.\n\nSeven-Up Bottling Company, manufacturer of beverages and carbonated soft drinks, commenced the production of hand sanitizers, dish-washing soap, medicated soaps, etc.\n\nHello Products Limited, maker and distributor of personal care items under its Tetmosol brand, spread its tentacles into the production of insecticides, liquid antiseptic and hand sanitizers.\n\nMergers & acquisitions: The manufacturing sector also witnessed the commencement of some merger and acquisition deals, which are yet to be finalised, such as the acquisition of 71.69 percent of Honeywell Group Limited stake worth N80 billion by the Flour Mills of Nigeria plc.\n\nSimilarly, Moroccan mattress maker of Dolidol, backed by African private equity firm Development Partners International (DPI) signed a deal to acquire Mouka, a Nigerian manufacturer of mattresses and pillows for $60 million.\n\nAccording to experts, the sector recorded mergers and acquisitions due to the struggle with inherent challenges affecting productivity and revenue. In addition, consumers\u2019 loyalty shifted to more essential items and products they could afford, which affected the volume of sales.\n\nHowever, for the big players, experts say the M&A deals aimed to foster expansion and also position companies strategically in participating under the AfCFTA.\n\nAdoption of cleaner energy: Manufacturers increased the adoption of cleaner energy as companies like Nigerian Breweries commissioned a 666.3kWp solar power plant to power its Ibadan brewery. Also, Nigerian Bottling Company commenced the transition of four of its manufacturing plants in Maiduguri, Kano, Asejire and Abuja to renewable energy sources through the installation of solar power infrastructure, while other firms make plans to follow suit.",

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "\u2018Be circumspect in your words and actions\u2019 \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu advises followers in end-of-year message",
          "text": "The detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has called on his followers to more circumspect in their words and actions, while thanking them for remaining undaunted.\n\nIfeanyi Ejiofor, his lead counsel, who conveyed his message in a statement on his Facebook handle on Thursday, said the IPOB leader consistently laid emphasis on discipline and obedience to the hierarchy of command, while maintaining that his position on this is definite and unshifting.\n\n\u201cI undertook our routine visit to Onyendu today. I did so exclusively. In the course of my visit, both of us engaged in fruitful discussions that substantially bothered on the legal strategy we would deploy at the next court sitting on the 18th of January, 2022,\u201d Ejiofor wrote.\n\n\u201cOnyendu was particularly enthused when he realised that we have set to task and brought to perfection all legal engineering implicit in the options available to us.\n\n\u201cI also briefed Onyendu on a number of subsidiary but very important issues. He consistently laid emphasis on discipline and obedience to the hierarchy of command and maintained that his position on this is definite and unshifting.\n\n\u201cFurther, he made the point for the consumption of millions of his supporters, that the recent development in Imo State signifies a clear message to UMUCHINEKE that ChukwuOkike Abiama predominates in all human affairs and would continue to rule in the affairs of men.\n\n\u201cThe recent stunning revelation in Imo State vindicates Onyendu entirely. He has long before now made the point that the chilling atrocities perpetrated in Imo State by agents of darkness are the handworks of politicians, who are their masterminds and pay masters. Onyendu has therefore exhorted UMUCHINEKE and his followers in general to remain calm, law abiding, focused and peaceful in all their undertakings. He predicted that many more criminal gangs ravaging our land will sooner than later gravitate to their deserving and ignoble end.\n\n\u201cHe was also emphatic on the need for UMUCHINEKE to be circumspect in their words and actions. He admonished UMUCHINEKE, and his other followers in general to be eternally vigilant in all they do and to show conscious restraint and forbearance at all times. He warned that enemies of struggle are sundry and varied and that they constantly evolve devious strategies to inflict anarchy and mayhem on the polity.\n\n\u201cWhen they actualise their evil plan in any instance, they knowingly instigate a false propaganda and lay blame for what they have done on the doorstep of members of IPOB. Onyendu has today cursed the persons concerned and has declared that eternal perdition will be their reward.\n\n\u201cOnyendu is also genuinely concerned about the magnitude of violence that has been unleashed by criminal gangs in the land of our fathers. These gangs, no doubt, are the foot soldiers of those workers of iniquity intent on given the peaceful movement a bad name. Members of these gangs are sponsored and comforted by these elements. Onyendu is emphatic on the curse he has placed on them. He has supplicated unto ChukwuOkike Abiama to guide and protect Umuchineke and to continually expose and punish those elements intent on besmirching them.\n\n\u201cFurther, Onyendu has admonished his followers against being purveyors of falsehood and cheap talk. They should not knowingly assist his detractors by unwittingly propagating falsehood. He issued a stern warning against those he regarded as not keeping faith with the structure he has put in place.\n\n\u201cHe observed that deliberate propagation of falsehood is aimed at misleading the unwary and uninformed and, most times, is targeted at foisting mischief and disaffection in the system. It is a set objective of all those detractors whose pastime is the pull the peaceful movement down. But such detractors have always failed to achieve that objective and would never succeed no matter how hard they try.\n\n\u201cHe also observed that correct information dissemination is an important tool. He advised that any information about him should proceed from the appropriate channel and must be verified to confirm its authenticity. Persons seeking such information must desist from resorting to fake platforms created by his enemies to source for such information.\n\n\u201cOnyendu sends his best compliments and appreciation to all those of his followers who have remained undaunted and defiant in the face of all odds. He salutes all those who have remained resolute and undistracted to the cause and demonstrably obedient to the appropriate chain of command.\n\n\u201cThe new year offers us renewed hope in ChukwuOkike Abiama. It will herald divine grace and favour of unimaginable proportions. Abiding grace and miraculous happenings will punctuate it. Sorrow and sighing shall take a sudden and unremitting flight. ChukwuOkike Abiama being and abiding with us, we shall reap and appropriate beneficially comprehensive victory on all sides.\u201d",

Under the APC government, the external debt has reached over $38bn and counting, with no corresponding investment in the economy or infrastructure.\n\nIt said, \u201cToday, the poverty rate in Nigeria is 71 per cent as against 32 per cent when the APC government took over in 2015. Between January and September 2021, over $1.8bn was expended on debt services, yet the APC government claims to have performed in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is self-evident that only the APC can claim to have performed in the face of life discounting experiences of the ordinary Nigerians. The APC government has nothing to say to the fact that under its watch, the naira has collapsed from N198 to a dollar handed over to it in 2015 to over N500 today; that the pump price of fuel has risen from N87 per litre in 2015 to N165 per litre today; that unemployment has risen from 7.3 per cent in 2015 to over 33 per cent today and that price of food items have so skyrocketed that millions of Nigerian families are no longer able to afford their daily meals and other necessities of life.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also accused the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of being a haven of compromised and corrupt politicians, saying that it has no answer to reports of how its leaders and their cronies stole over N25tn from various government agencies.\n\n\u201cIt also explains why the APC government has failed to prosecute its officials and APC leaders openly indicted for corruption,\u201d it added.\n\nOn infrastructure, the opposition party alleged that the APC-led government listed projects that exist only on paper as achievements and attempted to appropriate projects by PDP administrations.\n\nIt, therefore, challenged the APC government to name one landmark project it conceptualised, commenced and completed in the last six years.\n\nIt further said the APC is oblivious of the pains and tears that its leadership has \u201cinflicted on Nigerians.\u201d",

So basically they\u2019ve built right through it, and largely on schedule too.\n\nMining is another sector in which the Buhari Administration and now Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has been paying much attention.\n\nAccording to the company \u201cit would be a great advantage for Thor, for Osun State (which has humongous deposits of gold), and for Nigeria, which stands to transform solid minerals into the new \u2018oil & gas\u2019 and the benefit of eating jobs, increase in taxes, training and technological transfer which would benefit Nigerian youths and open up the gates for others, especially Nigerians, who would like to go into mining.\u201d\n\nOfficials of the Osun State government averd that the the opportunity offered by the gold in the state is equally a win for the repositioning Agenda of Governor Oyetola, as diversifications will mean more revenue and harnessing of natural and human resources within the state.\n\nThe Segilola gold mine is regarded as the most advanced gold project in Nigeria with a total reserve of 517, 800 gold ounces grading at 4.02 g/t and now the the first Nigeria\u2019s commercial gold deposit.\n\nIt is also now operating at 90,000 tonnes of ore material with 2 ore zones prepared for the commencement of higher- grade direct tip operations.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "A civil society organisation, Centre for Liberty, on Thursday faulted the claim attributed to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), made what he described as tremendous progress in the fight against banditry and insurgency in 2021.\n\nMohammed had, at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday to showcase the \u201cachievements\u201d of the Buhari regime, said although security remained the major challenge in the outgoing year, the regime made tremendous progress in fighting insecurity and growing the economy.\n\nBut the Convener of Centre for Liberty, Dare Ariyo-Atoye, in an interview with one of our correspondents wondered why the minister could make such a claim when, according to him, the President could not even secure his state, Katsina.\n\nHe noted that Mohammed\u2019s claim came at a time the President\u2019s state governor, Aminu Masari, told residents of the state to bear arms and secure themselves.\n\n\u201cSo, which success or effort is the minister referring to?\u201d he asked.\n\nAriyo-Atoye reminded the minister that insecurity was one of the issues the President cited in his letter to the National Assembly when he refused to sign the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill into law.\n\nHe said, If the President himself can admit that there is insecurity and he has not been able to tackle it, how will Lai Mohammed then come out to make claims of success?\n\nAlso, the coordinator, Northern Alliance Movement, Yahuza Getso said, \u201cThe significant progress in respect to failure? Significant progress when he has exhibited that he lacks the competence to tackle insecurity?\n\n\u201cThe president is an absolute failure. Let Lai Mohammed know that Nigerians will not forget this administration for bad.\u201d\n\nThe National Coordinator of Advocate for Peoples Rights and Justice, Victor Giwa, said Nigerians should be allowed to decide a scorecard for the President.\n\nHe advised the minister to stop playing on the intelligence of Nigerians with his comments.\n\nGiwa said, \u201cThat statement is false, Lai has the pedigree of misguiding the public.\n\n\u201cHe should not tell us what they have done. Nigerians can feel it. Buhari\u2019s achievements is not what he should state, his achievements are what Nigerians should know. Even on security can anyone say the country is more secured than it was?\u201d\n\nBut Mohammed claimed in his presentation that the present regime has made tremendous progress in the fight against banditry and insurgency in 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis administration, in spite of daunting challenges, made tremendous progress in 2021 in fighting insecurity, growing the economy, reforming the oil sector to spur more investments, emplacing world-class infrastructure, providing social safety net for the poor and most vulnerable in the society and also taking advantage of the huge opportunities offered by the Information and Communications Technology Sector.\n\n\u201cLet me admit straight away that the year has not been devoid of challenges. For the outgoing year, in particular, the major challenge has been that of insecurity. In spite of this and the usual economic challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, the administration has availed itself creditably, as we will be demonstrating shortly.\n\nThe minister hailed the military for its efforts in the fight against insurgency.\n\n\u201cAs I said in my introductory remarks, our biggest challenge in the outgoing year is in the area of security. Despite the enormity of the challenge, our military has continued to live up to its billing.\n\n\u201cWe owe them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and sacrifice. We just can\u2019t appreciate them enough, as you will soon see when I break down their achievements in the year under review,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nHe also appreciated Nigerians for their perseverance in the face of the security challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to sincerely thank all Nigerians for their support and perseverance. We want to reassure the nation that President Muhammadu Buhari is determined to leave a legacy of a safe, secure and prosperous nation,\u201d he added.\n\nSome of the achievements of the Buhari regime according to Mohammed, include the growth of the country\u2019s GDP, passage and signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act, N287bn profit after tax by the NNPC, the expansion N-Power from 500,000 to one million beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThe Digital Economy sector was highly instrumental in lifting the Nigerian economy out of recession. According to the Q4 2020 Report on Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector recorded the highest growth rate of all the sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown of the different sectors shows that the 14.7 per cent growth rate of the ICT sector was greater than the combined 14.21 per cent growth of the 2nd to 7th fastest growing sectors in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe telecommunications sector alone recorded a growth rate of 15.90 per cent, representing its highest growth rate in the last 10 years.

The National Assembly raised the total 2022 budget figure from the proposed N16.391 trillion to N17.126 trillion.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, had disclosed to Channels Television on Tuesday that the budget would be signed on Friday.\n\nChannels Television had also obtained a communication addressed to the Presidency by the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mr Ojo Amos, indicating that the bill had been transmitted by the National Assembly.\n\nThe document, with Reference Number NASS/CNA/37/Vol.1/35, suggested that the budget was transmitted last Friday and received by the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President on Saturday.",

          "text": "The UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, has pledged up to \u00a3105 million of UK emergency aid to help vulnerable countries tackle the Omicron Covid-19 variant, with a particular focus on Africa.\n\nThe vital aid will be delivered through trusted partners, such as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and will:\n\n\u201cScale-up testing \u2013 especially in parts of Africa where testing rates for Covid-19 remain lowest \u2013 allowing health systems to track and respond to the spread of the virus more effectively. This is in addition to the UK\u2019s world-leading genomic sequencing support.\n\n\u201cImprove access to oxygen supplies for ventilators \u2013 a surge in demand for oxygen is a significant risk for some countries.\n\n\u201cProvide communities with hygiene advice, products and access to handwashing facilities and support deep cleaning in schools, health centres and other public places. This will build on the successful global hygiene campaign between UK aid and Unilever which has reached over 1.2 billion people since its launch in 2020.\n\n\u201cFund the UK\u2019s ground-breaking science and research into the spread of variants like Omicron to enable innovative evidence-based policy responses in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\u201cReady the UK\u2019s own expert emergency teams for deployment overseas to crisis hotspots, including with new medical equipment.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: WHO Warns Of \u2018Very High\u2019 Omicron Risk As COVID-19 Cases Surge Worldwide\n\nAccording to a statement from the British High Commission, the government has also confirmed today that over 30 million vaccines have been delivered so far as part of the UK\u2019s pledge to donate 100 million doses to the world, benefitting more than 30 countries, including Nigeria.\n\nDoses donated by the UK have reached four continents and provided vital protection from Covid-19 in countries including Nigeria, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana and Rwanda.\n\nOf the more than 30 million doses now donated so far, 24.6 million have been received by COVAX for delivery to countries and 5.5 million have been shared directly with countries in need.\n\nThe UK has so far donated to Nigeria over 1.2m doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines through COVAX in 2021. Millions more vaccines will be sent to Nigeria and other countries in 2022, including 20 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses and 20 million Janssen doses.\n\nThe statement further notes that \u201cthe UK has been at the forefront of the global response to Covid-19. Today\u2019s announcement builds on the \u00a31.3 billion in UK aid committed to the international health response early on in the pandemic, supporting vaccines, health systems and economic recovery in developing countries.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government has also invested more than \u00a388 million to support the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and the UK became the first country in the world to approve the jab a year ago today.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) supported the improved capability and capacity of the NCDC for COVID genomic sequencing, which has now conducted more than 2000 tests compared to about 400 tests six months ago.\n\n\u201cThe UKHSA is also building the diagnostic capacity in Nigeria for common childhood diseases, such as pertussis (whooping cough) and other diseases of public health significance.\n\n\u201cThe UKHSA is also supporting the development of national and subnational health security plans, including building the technical and leadership capacity within the NCDC.\n\n\u201cThe UKAid funded Lafiya programme has also supported the procurement of \u00a32m worth of PPE kits, protecting more than 5,000 health workers in the five Northern States: Borno, Yobe, Kaduna, Kano and Jigawa.\u201d\n\nThanks to AstraZeneca\u2019s commitment to distribute the vaccine on a non-profit basis, 2.5 billion doses have been used in more than 170 countries, two-thirds of which are low- and middle-income countries.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cThe UK is providing vital assistance to help tackle the spread of new variants around the world.\n\n\u201cThis is key to securing our freedom and ending this pandemic once and for all. I am proud that we have also delivered over 30 million vaccines to benefit our friends around the world this year.\n\n\u201cThe UK is helping other countries most in need. No one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also on the subject matter, the Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cThe global pandemic has challenged health systems around the world and the best way to overcome this awful disease is to unite and stand side by side with our international partners.\n\n\u201cBy supporting countries with the UK\u2019s groundbreaking science and research into the spread of variants, improving access to oxygen and scaling up testing we will help those most in need chart their course out of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI am proud that we have already delivered over 30 million vaccines to our friends abroad. The UK, as a global leader, is helping other countries most in need. No one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: \u201cWe welcome the UK\u2019s commitment in new funding to protect the most vulnerable, particularly in Africa; the UK\u2019s continued focus on COVAX and equitable global access to COVID19 vaccines, both through early financing commitments made at UNGA 2020, as well as meeting the Prime Minister\u2019s G7 commitment to dose sharing \u2013 the 30m target set by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to operationalising the remainder of the UK\u2019s dose sharing commitment via COVAX in 2022, while we also work with the UK Government on continuing to support Gavi\u2019s ambitious 2021-2025 routine vaccination programmes, of which the United Kingdom is the largest funder through the PM\u2019s commitment made at the UK-hosted Global Vaccine Summit in June 2020.\u201d",

          "title": "NNPC Transformation, PIA Passage, Economic Recovery \u2013 Lai Lists Buhari\u2019s 2021 Achievements",
          "text": "Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has listed some of the achievements of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to include the transformation of NNPC, passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), economic recovery among others.\n\nThe Minister gave the list of achievements on Thursday during a press conference in Lagos.\n\nMohammed said despite challenges that came with 2021, the administration made \u201ctremendous\u201d progress in fighting insecurity and growing the economy.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cFor the outgoing year in particular, the major challenge has been that of insecurity. In spite of this and the usual economic challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, the Administration has availed itself creditably, as we will be demonstrating shortly.\u201d\n\nFind below the Minister\u2019s full statement\u2026\n\nGentlemen, good morning, and thanks for honouring our invitation to this press conference which, in line with our tradition, we have called to brief you on the achievements of the Buhari Administration in 2021.\n\nIn view of the long list of achievements and time constraints, we will go straight into the highlights and then provide you with a fuller list. Let me admit straightaway that the year has not been devoid of challenges. For the outgoing year in particular, the major challenge has been that of insecurity. In spite of this and the usual economic challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, the Administration has availed itself creditably, as we will be demonstrating shortly.\n\nAs I said in my introductory remarks, our biggest challenge in the outgoing year is in the area of security. Despite the enormity of the challenge, our military has continued to live up to their billing. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and sacrifice. We just can\u2019t appreciate them enough, as you will soon see when I break down their achievements in the year under review. To keep our country safe, the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) has set up various operations across the country. These include the Joint Task Force (JTF) North East, tagged Operation HADIN KAI covering the North East region; the JTF SS, tagged Operation DELTA SAFE covering the South South region; the JTF NW, known as Operation HADARIN DAJI covering the North West region; Operation SAFE HAVEN covering Plateau, parts of Kaduna and Bauchi States; Operation WHIRL STROKE covering Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States; JTF SW, referred to as Operation AWATSE and covering Lagos and Ogun States; Operation THUNDER STRIKE covering Abuja-Kaduna Highway and Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna State. Gentlemen, in the North East Zone under Operation HADIN KAI, a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic operations, coupled with a review of strategies, led to the neutralization of over 1000 terrorists, rescue of 2000 civilians and the surrender of over 22,000 terrorists including their families. Many arms and ammunition were also recovered. This is in addition to destruction of several IED/bomb making factories of the ISWAP/BHT.\n\nUnder Operation HADARIN DAJI in the North West, the conduct of offensive clearance operations, raids and air operations resulted in the neutralization of about 427 bandits, arrest of 257 bandits, rescue of 897 civilians and recovery of 3,087 livestock. Similarly, Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna neutralized about 215 bandits, arrested 133 bandits, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock, while Operation THUNDER STRIKE neutralized 36 bandits, arrested 74, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock. In the North Central, raids and clearance operations conducted by Operation SAFE HAVEN neutralized 91 criminal elements, arrested 155 suspects, rescued 159 civilians and recovered 3,259 livestock.\n\nFor its part, Operation WHIRL STROKE neutralized 158 criminals, arrested 151 suspects and rescued 183 civilians. Operation DELTA SAFE in the South-South destroyed about 1,520 illegal refineries, confiscated 5,315 storage facilities and impounded 617 boats, amongst other items. Additionally, about 74,297,425 litres of Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), 41,971,693 litres of crude oil and 88,350 litres of PMS were recovered. Furthermore, 174 trucks and 13 vessels were impounded while 755 illegal oil bunkerers were arrested and 153 assorted weapons recovered.\n\nIn the South West, patrols and clearance operations by troops of Operation AWATSE led to the arrest of 46 persons for various forms of criminalities while several vehicles, jerricans, motorcycles and electricity generators used for illegal bunkering were seized.\n\nThe effectiveness of the military was enhanced by the leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari and the unwavering commitment of the armed forces and its leadership. The procurement of modern platforms for the armed forces has also gone a long way in raising the level of their operational readiness and efficiency, in addition to boosting their capabilities. During the period under review, the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding. Various kits were equally provided for troops. This is in addition to the provision of accommodation for troops and the recruitment of over 10,000 personnel into the Army. The Nigerian Navy (NN), for its part, commissioned the FALCON EYE Maritime Domain Awareness Capability, the third locally-built Seaward Defense Boat, one helicopter, 4 inshore patrol boats and 90 Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats. Over 1,500 personnel were recruited into the Navy during the year. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it has conducted several Air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements. The Armed Forces of Nigeria has also contributed immensely to International peace and security efforts with its robust participation in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the regional initiative, the ECOWAS Military Intervention in Gambia (ECOMIG). The Nigerian military\u2019s continued participation in these Missions has ensured their viability and sustenance towards achieving their military and political goals.\n\nOverall, the good news is that the military, in spite of its achievements, is not resting on its oars. The Military has assured that it is also poised, in fulfillment of its constitutional duties, to address the myriad of evolving contemporary threats, particularly as the 2023 elections draw nearer.\n\nStill on the fight against insecurity, the implementation of the community policing initiative of the current administration has led to the training of 25,000 constabularies in several police colleges across the country. The successful officers who were trained on basic police duties, modern intelligence gathering techniques, rule of law, etc. were deployed to their Local Governments of Origin to aid in intelligence gathering and improve police visibility in their communities.\n\nAlso, to improve the police/citizens ratio, 418 Cadet officers of regular course 3 were successfully graduated in June 2021 and deployed into the operational asset of the Nigeria Police Force. Through the Police Trust Fund, 200 Buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vest, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT). The Ministry of Police Affairs has also entered into a contract agreement for the supply of police Anti Riot Equipment with Poly Technology of China through a Government-to-Government arrangement at a cost of 44 million U.S. Dollars. These equipment will go a long way in boosting the capacity of the police to control civil unrest in the most efficient and civil manner.\n\nThe recovery of the economy remained on a steady path throughout the year 2021. As you are aware, gentlemen, many countries around the world face unprecedented challenges, starting from 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Nigeria is no exception. The Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession. The poor performance of the economy during the COVID-19 era affected output growth, trade, household welfare and livelihood.\n\nHowever, this led to a quick response by the Federal Government with the rolling out of effective fiscal and monetary policies as well as health-related policies intended to curb the spread of the pandemic and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy. This has yielded considerable results. For example, the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021 was positive, recording real GDP of 0.51 percent in Q1, 5.01 percent in Q2 and 4.03 percent in Q3 2021, this was an improvement from a declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020 (which led to economic recession) put at 1.87 percent in Q1, -6.10 percent in Q2 and -3.62 percent in Q3 2020.\n\nNevertheless, the fourth quarter 2020 recorded a slight improvement of 0.11 percent, ushering in positive growth rates in the three quarters of 2021. This economic performance in 2021 shows a steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020, and this can be attributed to government policies and strategies such as the Economic Sustainability Plan; the N500 billion COVID 19 Crisis Intervention Fund etc.\n\nIn the oil sector, real growth shows poorer performance in 2021, recording 2.21% (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, -12.65% in Q2 2021 and \u201310.73% in Q3 2021, from stronger growth of 5.06% in Q1 2020, -6.63% in Q2 2020, and -13.89% in Q3 2020. However, oil production in million barrel per day continued to decline in 2021, from 2.07mbpd in Q1 2020,1.81mbpd in Q2 2020, 1.67mbpd in Q3 2020 to 1.72mbpd in Q1 2021, 1.61mbpd in Q2 2021 and 1.57mbpd in Q3 2021. Non-oil sector indicated better performance of 0.79% in Q1 2021, 6.74% in Q2 2021 and 5.44% in Q3 2021, compared to 1.55% in Q1 2020, -6.05% in Q2 2020, and -2.51% in Q3 2020. In Foreign Trade, Nigeria witnessed dwindling performance in 2020, arising from trade restrictions on accounts of COVID-19 pandemic. Disruptions of trading activities driven by the pandemic further weakened the balance of trade witnessed in Q4 2019 in the subsequent quarters. Consequently, total imports in the first three quarters of 2021 rose by 57.13%, from N13.97 in the corresponding quarters of 2020 to N21.95 trillion.\n\nSimilarly, total exports grew by 40.62%, which was N13.12 trillion in the first three quarters of 2021, compared to N9.33trillion in the corresponding period, an indication of improved trading activities although with a deficit position. Over the same period crude oil export improved considerably at N10.03 trillion, compared to N6.92 trillion, showing a growth rate of 44.93%, while Non-oil exports grew by 21.17% \u2013 from N1.19trillion to N1.44trillion over the same period.\n\nInflation rate has continued to decline on a year-on-year basis since April 2021 when 18.12% was recorded. Looking at the trend, a declining rate was recorded from 17.93% in May to 17.01% in August, 15.99% in October and 15.40% November 2021. It is projected that proper implementation of the proposed 2022 project of N17.13trillion, and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework & Fiscal Strategy Paper 2022-2024 are likely to improve the performance of the economy.\n\nAlso, judicious implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act will likely improve oil production/sales stability; relatively high oil prices will enhance revenue performance and budget implementation, while strengthening security will improve output growth of the economy.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of the Administration in 2021, and indeed in the past several decades, was recorded in the oil and gas sector, a sector very critical to the nation\u2019s economic well-being.\n\nThe passage and signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is a landmark achievement. Many have described it as the most profound event in the Nigerian oil and gas space in the last 20 years. The PIA is envisaged to foster investment in the industry and delineate responsibilities to the various institutions. Its key objectives are:- to establish a commercialized National Oil Company (NNPC Ltd.) \u2013 to entrench accountability and good governance\ufffd- to promote the exploration and exploitation of the petroleum resources in Nigeria for the benefit of all Nigerians as well as foster the sustainable development of the host communities.\n\nOverall, the PIA serves to ensure the efficient and effective technical and operational regulation of the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil industry through the formation of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, among others. Also worthy of note is the transformation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The nation\u2019s national oil entity has witnessed many changes and transformation through the decades. From its take-off on 1st April 1977 as a merger of the Nigerian National Oil Corporation (NNOC) and the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Energy Resources, the NNPC \u2013 now re-christened NNPC Limited \u2013 has been undergoing the kind of transformation designed to re-invent the entity for greater efficiency and value creation. Yet, the changes and the unprecedented deluge of reformations in 2021 eclipse previous attempts to restructure the oil company.\n\nThe tempo created with the passage and eventual presidential assent of the PIA was sustained with the quick activation of Part V of the new law which requires the incorporation of a commercial and profit-focused National Oil Company (NOC) within six (6) months of the passage into law. Thus, the NNPC Management \u2013 on behalf of the Federal Government \u2013 incorporated the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. Under the new arrangement, NNPC Ltd will, on behalf of the Federation, take over assets, interests and liabilities of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nAnother major achievement in the sector is the posting of a N287 billion profit, after tax, by the NNPC. It was the first time in 44 years that the Corporation has recorded such profit, which the NNPC attributed to aggressive cost cutting measures, cost savings through renegotiation of contracts by up to 30%, improved efficiency through business automation, emphasis on commercially-focused investment and non-interference in the management of the corporation\u2019s affairs, among other factors. The construction/rehabilitation of 21 Roads under the Federal Government\u2019s Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme is also a major achievement.\n\nRecall, gentlemen, that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved N621.2 billion for the NNPC to take over the reconstruction of 21 federal roads across the six geopolitical zones of the country. The construction and rehabilitation of the selected roads are meant as strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nWithout question, an area in which the present Administration has distinguished itself is in the provision of key infrastructures, which is important to the growth and development of any economy. In its efforts to provide basic infrastructure, especially roads and housing, the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing carried out the following projects in 2021. (I) Nnewi-Uduma Road, Sections I and II (26.27km) in Enugu and Ebonyi States (II) Kano-Maiduguri Road Section II (100.08KM), (Shuwarin-Azare) in Jigawa and Bauchi States (III) Kano-Maiduguri Road Section III (Azare-Potiskum) 106.34km in Bauchi and Yobe States (IV) Vandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road Phase I and II (24km) in Benue and Cross River States (V) Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (304km). Also, various highway and bridge projects at various stages of completion are ongoing across the six-geopolitical zones of the country. The bridges include the much-talked-about 2nd Niger Bridge, which is currently at 78% completion and is expected to be ready by November 2022. Ongoing work on the bridge consists of the construction of a 1.59km long bridge and 10.3km length of approach roads. The total length of the Main Work is 11.90km. The bridge and approach roads are 2\u00d73 lane expressways. Other ancillary works include the construction of two secondary bridges at Oko Amakun (21.70m) and Atani Road (21.70m). Also to be constructed is a new cloverleaf interchange at Onitsha-Owerri Road. Several culverts and drainage structures will also be constructed. There is also the 360-meter bridge at Ikom in Cross River State, which was completed in 2021 and awaiting commissioning; the 400-meter border bridge between Nigeria and Cameroon at Mfum and Ekok, which was also completed in 2021 and is now awaiting commissioning. In order to ensure that the private sector participates in and contributes to the implementation of Federal Government Programmes, the Federal Ministry of works and Housing is developing a Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), a framework for the private sector participation in road development. HDMI was created by the Ministry to manage and develop the Federal Road network, with the aim of attracting sustainable investment and funding in the development of road infrastructure and maximizing the use of assets along the right of way.\n\nThe rationale behind the private sector engagement under the HDMI is to provide an alternative avenue of financing road construction, management and maintenance. Out of the total length of the Federal road network of about 35,000km, the first phase of the proposed project will cover a total length of about 1,963.24km. Most of the ongoing projects of the Ministry, especially the Highways Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), are already attracting massive infrastructural investment. It is envisaged that over a trillion-naira direct investment will be mobilized in the first phase of the HDMI.\n\nIt is imperative to state that the policies, programmes and projects of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing have contributed to stabilizing the macro-economic situation of the country, particularly in job creation. The activities of the Ministry have further contributed to the growth of other sectors of the economy such as the Mining sector through the supply of aggregates, laterite, limestone and other building materials; Cement manufacturing, Bitumen (Importation) and steel production to support construction needs; the fact that property values are reportedly appreciating by 30%-40% as a result of road transport infrastructure and the growing demand for petroleum products like diesel, petrol, lubricants and tyres as a result of construction activities and the need to operate machines. Key achievements recorded in the Aviation sector include the construction and installation of Boeing 737 full motion flight Simulator at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) in Zaria, a development that will save Nigeria millions of dollars spent in the retraining of pilots in other countries; the installation of fully-automated Aircraft Firefighter Training Simulator also at NCAT, the first of its kind in Africa; Re-fleeting of Trainer Aircraft in NCAT with six aircraft so far; installation of novel Cat III ILS/DME at Lagos and Abuja airports, instruments that will allow flights to land at low visibility; Procurement of two mobile control towers in Lagos and Abuja and the designation of four International Airports in Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt as Special Economic Zones, aimed at encouraging business/investment. Investors in Aviation, under this project, are to have pioneer industry status so as to have tax breaks. Definitely the most outstanding achievement in the transportation sector in 2021 is the flag-off of the commercial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line in June 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari. The trains are currently conveying goods and services and reducing traffic and human pressure on infrastructural facilities on the Lagos-Ibadan highway. Then there was the ground-breaking ceremony for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Narrow Gauge Railway project and the Bonny Deep Sea and Railway Industrial Park. The 2,044-km Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line cuts across Rivers, Imo, Anambra, Benue, Enugu, Ebonyi, Gombe, Yobe, Adamawa and Borno. President Buhari also performed the ground-breaking ceremony of the Kano-Kaduna standard gauge rail line modernization project in July 2021.\n\nThe Project is a continuation of the Lagos-Kano rail plan. It is the third segment, with Lagos-Ibadan as well as Ibadan-Kano as the 1st and 2nd segments, respectively. Then, the MOU for the construction of the US$1.959 billion Kano-Maradi standard gauge line was signed with the Portugues firm Mota-Engil Group. This is part of on-going Federal Government\u2019s initiative to provide inter-modal means of transportation across the country as well as enhance trade between Nigeria and some African countries. President Buhari subsequently performed the ground breaking of the project, which traverses the major commercial centre of Kano and passes through other economic hubs of the country, including Kazaure, Daura, Katsina and up to the border town of Jibiya and the city of Maradi in Niger Republic.\n\nOn completion, the project would promote import and export of goods from the Niger Republic and other countries in the sub-region through Nigerian ports. The country would earn revenue through expansion of trade and commerce, while the people of Niger Republic will benefit from the ease of transportation logistics at an affordable cost in their import and export business. The Federal Ministry of Transportation also launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure (also known as Deep Blue Asset). This is aimed at managing, controlling and protecting Nigerian waterways towards the advancement of coastal prosperity, as the Gulf of Guinea in recent times has become a hotbed for piracy.\n\nSome 159 Rural Water Supply Schemes were constructed in the North-East, IDP camps and some Federal Institutions and Establishments by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in the year under review. In addition to the completion of 12 dams, the Ministry also embarked on the implementation of the Partnership for Expanded Water Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH) programmes with the construction of 926 rural water supply schemes in 12 States of Imo, Katsina, Jigawa, Plateau, Zamfara, Sokoto, Ondo, Osun, Delta, Bauchi, Kaduna and Gombe States.\n\nAlso, the Clean Nigeria Campaign has yielded the following results in the last 12 months, with 71 LGAs now Open Defecation Free. In the area of irrigation, 96,000 hectares of irrigation have been developed as of 2021. In line with the plan to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next ten years, the Ministry has ensured that both direct and indirect jobs are created in the implementation of its programmes/projects. A total of 57,261 direct jobs and 11,588 indirect jobs have been created through the various dam, irrigation and water supply projects completed within the reporting period.\n\nThe Federal Government has continued to implement the National Social Investment Programmes. On the directive of Mr. President, the N-Power has been expanded from 500,000 to 1 million beneficiaries. The Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) has been restructured to GEEP 2.0. The revamped GEEP 2.0 was officially launched on 24 August 2021 and has successfully registered over 600,000 potential beneficiaries in all the 774 LGAs nationwide through collaborative partnership with the National Orientation Agency. The National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is also growing strong. As you know, the programme is designed as an incentive to boost school enrolment and improve nutrition of primary school pupils while sustaining the impact of agricultural and women entrepreneurs in communities to produce and provide a quality meal daily to pupils at the basic education level. The NHGSFP aims to provide free school meals to 25 million children in the country by 2030.\n\nCurrently, the programme is providing meals to nearly 10,000,000 school children nationwide. The programme has further empowered over 100,000 cooks and over 100,000 small holder farmers in the local areas where the schools are located, while creating employment opportunities across sectors such as transportation and manufacturing. The programme is being extended to children in non-conventional educational settings so that they may access its benefits. The Household Uplifting Programme (HUP), which has the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) as its flagship intervention, is designed to provide targeted financial transfers to poor and vulnerable households under an expanded national social safety nets system. Those enrolled in the programme benefit from monthly grants of N5,000 to smoothen consumption, stimulate demand and ensure survival directly in the household. Since inception, a total of 1,676,799 eligible households across the country are benefiting from monthly N5,000 grant, as of March 2021. This is in addition to the 1 million Urban Poor who are benefitting from the Conditional Cash Transfers, under the directive of Mr. President to further expand the programme due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nThe Digital Economy sector was highly instrumental in lifting the Nigerian economy out of recession. According to the Q4 2020 Report on\ufffdNigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector recorded the highest growth rate of all the sectors of the Nigerian economy. The breakdown of the different sectors shows that the 14.7% growth rate of the ICT sector was greater than the combined 14.21% growth of the 2nd to 7th fastest growing sectors in 2020. The telecommunications sector alone recorded a growth rate of 15.90%, representing its highest growth rate in the last 10 years. In the NBS report for the Q1 2021, the ICT sector maintained its position as the fastest growing sector of the economy. This therefore indicates that the Digital Economy sector has proven to be vital for the diversification of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe National Digital Economy Policy for a Digital Nigeria reflects the focus of the Federal Government with respect to Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy, which was hinged on 8 strategic pillars. And as part of the efforts aimed at implementing the Policy, some of the projects implemented nationwide include: \u2013 ICT Innovation Hubs- Digital Skills for Entrepreneurs and Innovators \u2013 Community IT Training Centers \u2013 Tertiary Institution Knowledge Centers (TIKC) \u2013 School Knowledge Centers (SKC), Digital Economy Centers, and Emergency Communication Centers (ECC), to mention but a few. Over 300 of these centers have been established all over the Country.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy \u2013 in order to ensure increased capacity download speed by up to 20 times and decrease latency \u2013 conducted a transparent bidding process for the provision of the 5G Network Service. Mafab Communications Ltd and MTN Nigeria Plc emerged the winners of the 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum auction. Gentlemen, as you can see, this Administration, in spite of daunting challenges, made tremendous progress in 2021 in fighting insecurity, growing the economy, reforming the oil sector to spur more investments, emplacing world class infrastructure, providing social safety net for the poor and most vulnerable in the society and also taking advantage of the huge opportunities offered by the Information and Communications Technology Sector. What we have done here is to highlight the major achievements, hence this is by no means exhaustive. That\u2019s why we are also giving you a list of 100 achievements of the Buhari Administration in 2021, Success is not measured by the number of challenges you face, but by how you tackle the challenges. This is what the Administration has demonstrated by tackling insecurity headlong while also growing and diversifying the economy. We want to most sincerely thank all Nigerians for their support and perseverance. We want to reassure the nation that President Muhammadu Buhari is determined to leave a legacy of a safe, secure and prosperous nation. We urge Nigerians not to relent in supporting our security forces, who continue to make sacrifices to keep our country safe.\n\nFinally, We thank you, gentlemen of the press for always honouring our invitation. Best wishes for a better year for all in 2022.",
          "summary": "The Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession.\nMany have described it as the most profound event in the Nigerian oil and gas space in the last 20 years.\nOut of the total length of the Federal road network of about 35,000km, the first phase of the proposed project will cover a total length of about 1,963.24km.\nThe Digital Economy sector was highly instrumental in lifting the Nigerian economy out of recession.\nThis therefore indicates that the Digital Economy sector has proven to be vital for the diversification of the Nigerian economy.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the list of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s achievements in 2021 as a \u2018joke of the year.\u2019\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed had earlier said on Thursday that despite the challenges in 2021, the Buhari administration made \u201ctremendous\u201d progress in fighting insecurity and growing the economy. He also highlighted \u201cmajor achievements\u201d which he said the Buhari administration recorded in 2021.\n\nIn reaction to this, PDP described the achievements as \u201ca joke of the year, a litany of lies and another celebration of falsehood by a failed administration,\u201d\n\nPDP spokesperson, Debo Ologunagba, in a statement on Thursday said, \u201cthe Performance claim by the APC government can only be a product of delusions of grandeur; a joke of the year, as the word on the street where the real Nigerians are, is completely at variance with the fabricated lies and imaginary performance indices contained in the report.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it not unpardonable that instead of facing its failures to secure our nation, the APC-led government which is still harbouring a self-confessed terrorism apologist, is celebrating the mass killings currently going on in our country by engaging in self-praise in the face of failure while terrorists continue to ravage our nation?\n\n\u201cOn the economy, the APC government had become so addicted to the falsehood that it had forgotten that Nigerians are aware that the PDP government handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) and a diversified economy to the APC in 2015. Today, our nation has become the poverty capital of the world due to the mismanagement, corruption, and recklessness of the APC government.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s external debt was $7.3 billion. Today under the clueless APC government, in just over six years, the external debt has reached over $38 billion and counting, with no corresponding investment in the economy or infrastructure,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nREAD ALSO: NNPC Transformation, PIA Passage, Economic Recovery \u2013 Lai Lists Buhari\u2019s 2021 Achievements\n\nPDP said further that the poverty rate in Nigeria is 71 percent as against 32 percent when the APC government took over in 2015 while between January and September 2021, over $1.8 billion was expended on debt services.\n\n\u201cIt is self-evident that only the APC gangsters can claim to have performed in the face of life discounting experiences of the ordinary Nigerians. Thankfully Nigerians now know them for who they are,\u201d Ologunagba added, noting that the APC government has nothing to say to the fact that under its watch, the naira has collapsed from N198 to a dollar handed over to it in 2015 to over N500 today; that the pump price of fuel has risen from N87 per liter in 2015 to N165 per liter today.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it is ludicrous that the APC government claimed to be fighting corruption when it has become the haven of compromised and corrupt politicians.\n\n\u201cEvidently, that is why it has no answer to reports of how APC leaders and their cronies stole over N25 trillion from various government agencies. It also explains why the APC government has failed to prosecute its officials and APC leaders openly indicted for corruption.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party said the infrastructural projects listed by the APC-led government \u201cexists only on paper as achievements and even attempted to appropriate projects by PDP administrations. The PDP challenges the APC government to name one landmark project it conceptualized, commenced and completed in the last six years\u201d.\n\nThe PDP said the APC is \u201coblivious of the pains and tears that their almost seven years of proven disappointment have inflicted on Nigerians,\u201d adding that it will be voted out of office in 2023.",

The blaze spans 6.5 square kilometres (2.5 square miles) and has engulfed parts of the area in smoky, orangish skies and sent residents scrambling to get to safety.\n\nThe activity of the fires, which are burning unusually late into the winter season, will depend on how the winds behave overnight and could determine when crews are able to go in and begin assessing the damage and searching for any victims.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of fire we can\u2019t fight head on,\u201d Pelle said. \u201cWe actually had deputy sheriffs and firefighters in areas that had to pull out because they just got overrun,\u201d he added.\n\nNews reports said at least 580 homes, a hotel and a shopping centre have burned. According to the Denver Post, the fire is the most destructive in Colorado\u2019s history in terms of the number of homes destroyed.\n\nGovernor Jared Polis declared a state of emergency to allow the use of disaster funding to support emergency response efforts and the mobilisation of the Colorado National Guard and other state resources as needed.\n\nA nearby portion of the US highway also was reported shut down because of a fire.\n\nVery strong winds fueling the #marshallfire. Never a good sign when radar shows a smoke plume this strong.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said in a social media post that smaller fires were also reported in at least two areas.\n\nThe weather agency warned that the fast-moving fires were creating a \u201clife-threatening situation\u201d in some areas.\n\nA mandatory evacuation has been ordered in all areas of Louisville except for two districts, according to the police department.\n\nThe extent of property losses was not immediately known, but a news station aired footage of homes engulfed in flames near Louisville.\n\nThe fires on the outskirts of the Denver metropolitan area, left bone dry from an extreme drought gripping eastern Colorado, followed several days of heavy snow in the Rocky Mountains to the west.",
          "summary": "Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and tens of thousands evacuated in Colorado, United States, after wildfires driven by high winds engulfed two towns near the state capital, Denver.\nThe neighbouring towns are roughly 32km (20 miles) northwest of Denver, a city of more than 715,000 people.\nAccording to the Denver Post, the fire is the most destructive in Colorado\u2019s history in terms of the number of homes destroyed.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said in a social media post that smaller fires were also reported in at least two areas.\nThe extent of property losses was not immediately known, but a news station aired footage of homes engulfed in flames near Louisville.",

          "text": "Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election.\n\nPark, 69, was the country\u2019s first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliamentary vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung and Lotte.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend\u2019s family and non-profit foundations.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to \u201covercome unfortunate past history and promote national unity\u201d.\n\nBroadcasters showed Park leaving a Seoul hospital, where she had stayed since last month for medical treatment, after correction officials delivered a letter of pardon at midnight.\n\nShe did not comment but her lawyer has said Park, the daughter of a former military ruler, had offered an apology for causing public concern and thanked Moon for making a \u201ctough decision\u201d.\n\nPark\u2019s release comes as her old party, the main opposition conservative People Power Party, and Moon\u2019s Democratic Party are in a tight presidential race.\n\nHer imprisonment divided the country, with right-wing, pro-Park groups staging weekly rallies to denounce Moon and his policies and call for Park\u2019s release, until COVID-19 distancing rules stifled the rallies last year.\n\nHundreds of Park\u2019s supporters braved freezing temperatures to flock to the hospital where she was staying late on Thursday to celebrate her release, with more than 1,000 bouquets of flowers arriving.\n\nAbout 200 people held a protest in downtown Seoul against her release, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nIt was not clear if Park would resume any political activity but she said in a memoir released on Thursday that her conviction was politically motivated and she expressed hopes to \u201cmeet the people again one day\u201d.\n\nPeople Power\u2019s presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who investigated the Park scandal as prosecutor-general, said on Friday he had done his job as a public servant, adding he would like to visit Park when her health improved.",

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his United States counterpart Joe Biden that any sanctions over Ukraine would be a big mistake, an aide to the Kremlin said on Thursday, after the two leaders spoke by phone ahead of lower-level talks next month.\n\nThe call, which US officials said began at 3:35pm EST (20:35 GMT) and lasted 50 minutes, came amid weeks of Western concerns over Russia\u2019s deployment of tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine.\n\nKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Russia was satisfied with the conversation, which he said centred on security guarantees that Moscow wants from the West, but that any substantial sanctions against Russia would be \u201ca colossal mistake\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope this will not happen,\u201d Ushakov told reporters after the phone call.\n\nIt was the second time Putin and Biden held direct talks this month, as the Russian military buildup near Ukraine continues to heighten fears that Russia may be preparing for an imminent invasion of its neighbour.\n\nIn a statement describing Thursday\u2019s talks, the White House said Biden urged Putin to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the simmering tensions and \u201cmade clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied that it plans to make an incursion into Ukraine, instead accusing Western nations of undermining the security situation in the region through the expansion of NATO and Ukraine\u2019s growing ties with the alliance.\n\nAhead of the discussion, both sides insisted they were ready to listen. But with Thursday\u2019s talks setting the stage for lower-level, face-to-face negotiations in Geneva in January, there were few indications of significant concessions on the horizon.\n\nBiden expressed support for those upcoming discussions during his call with Putin, the White House also said, and \u201creiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation\u201d.\n\nSamuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King\u2019s College London, told Al Jazeera that both the US and Russia \u201cneed to be seen as putting the effort in\u201d amid the tensions.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Putin to claim some victory, to show that maybe the West is buckling a little bit \u2013 if he can spin it that way,\u201d Greene said. \u201cFor the Biden administration \u2026 and the European allies, it\u2019s extremely important to really do everything they can \u2013 short of making concessions that they can\u2019t make \u2013 to ensure peace and security in and around Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTalks next month\n\nEarlier this month, the Russian government published draft security pacts demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the deployment of troops and weapons in central and eastern Europe.\n\nBut the US and its NATO allies have said only members of the alliance can decide when other nations join, while stressing that any security talks with Moscow would need to take into account NATO\u2019s concerns and involve Ukraine and other partners.\n\nSergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said this week that Russian diplomats and military officials would take part in talks with the US next month on the list of security guarantees Moscow wants from Washington.\n\nThose discussions in Geneva are set to take place on January 10, while Moscow and NATO representatives are expected to meet on January 12. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia and the US, will address the tensions the following day.\n\nRussia\u2019s delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and the US delegation by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the US\u2019s \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, the State Department said.\n\nThe United Kingdom warned Russia last week that any incursion into Ukraine \u201cwould be a massive strategic mistake and would be met with strength, including coordinated sanctions with our allies to impose a severe cost on Russia\u2019s interests and economy\u201d.\n\nPutin has said Russia is not looking for war with its neighbour but wanted an \u201cimmediate\u201d response from the US and its allies to its demand for security guarantees.\n\nRussia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and shortly after supported a separatist rebellion in the country\u2019s east, plunging relations between Moscow and the West to post-Cold War lows.\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas, has killed more than 14,000 people to date, according to Kyiv.",

          "text": "Sudanese security forces have shot four people dead during nationwide protests, a doctors\u2019 group said, as tens of thousands of people marched against military rule.\n\nSecurity forces fired tear gas and stun grenades as protesters marched through Khartoum and the neighbouring cities of Omdurman and Bahri towards the presidential palace on Thursday.\n\nThe Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said four protesters were shot dead by security forces, three of them in Omdurman.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, police authorities confirmed the death toll and said 297 protesters and 49 police officers had been injured.\n\nThe protests were the 11th day of major demonstrations since an October 25 coup, which saw Abdallah Hamdok removed and then reinstated as prime minister. The demonstrators have been demanding that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections.\n\nReporting from Khartoum, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mohamed Vall said the situation in Omdurman had developed into a serious confrontation between the security forces and anti-coup protesters.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the day, the impression was that the protest was less violent and in smaller numbers than previous demonstrations.\n\n\u201cBut as the day progressed, it became clear that because the security forces prevented the protesters in Omdurman from crossing the bridges and reaching central Khartoum, the main confrontations took place there,\u201d said Vall.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Security forces confronted protesters about 2km (1.2 miles) from the palace in the centre of the capital, Reuters news agency reported, adding that there was a heavy security presence in the area.\n\nAmid a communications blackout, most bridges to Khartoum were closed, with at least two blocked by shipping containers. An army checkpoint with an armoured vehicle was seen at one of the bridges that remained open.\n\nProtesters heading towards the blocked bridge connecting the city of Bahri to the capital chanted: \u201cAs much as we sacrifice and die, we won\u2019t be ruled by the boot.\u201d\n\nProtesters continued facing tear gas in Bahri past sundown near the blocked bridge, a witness told Reuters.\n\nBridges were blocked off during the last protests on December 25, when tens of thousands took to the streets.\n\nProtesters opposed to military rule reached near the presidential palace that day, despite the extensive use of tear gas and a communications blackout. CCSD said more than 200 people were injured during that protest, with six caused by live bullets.\n\nAt least 52 people have been killed by security forces since pro-democracy activists launched a campaign of street demonstrations against the coup, according to the group.\n\nA source from a telecom company told Reuters the order to shut down the internet came from the Sudan National Telecommunications Corporation.\n\nActivists use the internet for organising demonstrations and broadcasting live footage of the rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, new surveillance cameras were installed on the Khartoum thoroughfares along which demonstrators were due to march on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking from Miami, Cameron Hudson, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said since the October 25 coup there have been \u201crepeated miscalculations by the military both in terms of the power and perseverance of the protest movement\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been more and more draconian efforts [by the military], essentially undermining whatever is left of the [political] transition at every stage,\u201d he added.\n\nBefore Thursday\u2019s protests, the US embassy appealed for restraint from the government led by military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, which had been counting on a controversial November partnership deal with Hamdok to calm public anger.\n\n\u201cThe US embassy reiterates its support for peaceful expression of democratic aspiration, and the need to respect and protect individuals exercising free speech,\u201d a statement said.\n\n\u201cWe call for extreme discretion in use of force and urge authorities to refrain from employing arbitrary detention.\u201d\n\nActivists have condemned the sexual attacks during the December 19 protests, in which the United Nations said at least 13 women and girls were raped or gang-raped.\n\nHamdok had been held under effective house arrest for weeks before returning to the prime ministerial post under the November deal, which promised elections in July 2023.\n\nBut the agreement was widely criticised as a gift to the military that gave a cloak of legitimacy to its coup, with pro-democracy protesters accusing Hamdok of \u201cbetrayal\u201d.\n\nSudan\u2019s sovereign council this week reinstated powers of arrests, detentions and seizures to the country\u2019s intelligence service.",
